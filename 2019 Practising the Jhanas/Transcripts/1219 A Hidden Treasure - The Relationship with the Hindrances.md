Actually, what I want to do is talk about the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>, but a couple of things before that. As I said, it's difficult teaching this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. There's so much I want to communicate, and so much that feels important to communicate, because you're all in different places with different needs. I mentioned the walking practice yesterday, and Derek's just mentioned _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Youre all in different places with different needs" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#You're all in different places with different needs" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1

Who is doing _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ as their basic practice? Anyone? Great, okay. When you walk, are you comfortable walking with the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice? Like, you know how to do that? Yeah? Okay. What I want to say, I guess, is I will talk about _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ tomorrow, but again, what I want to introduce is doing _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body awareness</a></span>, which means that I might have phrases, I might have visualizations or whatever, but I've actually got this whole space, and I never lose that, and I'm sensitive to that (I'll talk more about this tomorrow), so that when I walk up and down, I'm walking up and down in that kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, with all the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ and however I'm doing the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, yeah? Actually, that's all I want to say for now, and I'll talk about _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ tomorrow. Is that okay<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Metta with the energy body awareness while walking" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Metta with the energy body awareness while walking" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^1-2

Second thing, very briefly, I was very rushed in the latter part of yesterday's talk, so I just want to make sure that something was clear. It might have been clear anyway, and I might not need to say this. But when I was talking about, you know, "Why are we doing _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice?", and how we conceive of the reasons for doing _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice, and therefore what we emphasize, I don't want to replace other emphases or what other teachers might emphasize - simplifying, or laser beam, or unwavering <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, or all that. I don't want to replace those reasons - more _add_ to them, okay? So all those emphases are important, can get emphasized at different times, but I just want very much to add something that's not often talked about, that to me seems really, really important: these qualities of sensitivity, attunement, refinement, etc. It's more to add that to the possible reasons we're doing this, and the possible emphases, and actually, then, to allow those to be more prominent, or even the _most_ prominent emphases and reasons. So I didn't mean to say, you know, we're getting rid of all that. It's more just a question of emphasis<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > I want to _add_ reasons why doing jhana practice not get rid of others" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#I want to _add_ reasons why doing jhana practice not get rid of others" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3
###### 1-4
Okay, what I want to talk about, as I said, is the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>. Now, there are a few things here: one is that sometimes, in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sutta" data-href="Sutta" class="internal-link">suttas</a></span>, it's almost - not quite a definition, but it's almost like, with the abandoning of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>, there arises the first _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_. So it's almost like part of the definition of the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ is the absence of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>. It doesn't say, "With the unwavering <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a></span> on this or that." It says, "With the abandoning of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>."^[E.g. DN 2] That's quite interesting, and it's quite important. Again, it has implications. How am I thinking about what I'm doing here? But part of what I want to say about them is, it could sound like, "Okay, so working with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> is something that applies pre-<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>. And it certainly does, of course; it applies right from day one of anyone's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation practice</a></span>. But not _just_ then. Once the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a></span>,_ and even all eight _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a></span>,_ are maybe accessible and regular visitors or explorations, etc. - even once all that is kind of up and running and going and wonderful, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> will still arise at times. Absolutely<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > With the abandoning of the hindrances there arises the first jhana" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#With the abandoning of the hindrances there arises the first jhana" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4
###### 2-1
What I also want to add, and what's much less commonly talked about and acknowledged, is that they can arise very subtly, subtle versions of them can arise _in_ a _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ as well. Now I use that word _in,_ in a loose way, kind of avoiding the silliness of this extra-sharp definition of what is and what isn't a _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_. The point is, again, about subtlety, that even within a _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_, there can be subtle <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> around. And there's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sutta" class="internal-link">sutta</a></span> in the _Majjhima Nikāya_ where the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s teaching, actually, super, super-advanced meditators. They're doing all this whizzy stuff with psychic powers and all that stuff, and he's still talking to them about what subtle <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> arise in that depth of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_.^[MN 128] So we have to have this idea of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>, as I said earlier - they're part of the deal. They're part of the deal when, certainly, _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ feels like a million miles away. They're part of the deal once we've already had a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> in the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a></span>_. They'll be coming and going. And they're actually part of the deal in a subtle way even _in_ a _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_, therefore part of the work, part of the play, part of the whole. Again, when I say '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span> _practice,' I_ mean_ _including the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> and all that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Even within a jhana there can be subtle hindrances around" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Even within a jhana there can be subtle hindrances around" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1

I want to say something about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> in relation to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>, but first thing I want to do is rattle through pretty quickly, because a lot of this is probably familiar to you. I want to rattle through some antidotes to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>. First thing to say before that is, an 'antidote' is something we - you know, you apply something with a certain goal in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>: I want to get rid of something. I want an antidote to an illness, or whatever: let's hope to get rid of this illness. So there's, let's say, ways of practising <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a></span> at times, when a hindrance comes up, and the view is, "It's fine. It's just here. I just watch it. I do the same with a hindrance as I do with a non-hindrance or anything else. I'm just watching it. It's not better or worse. And I'm just - it's okay." When you're doing _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice, that's not the attitude. We want antidotes, and we want to work against the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>. And this is primarily, even in the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Satipatthana Sutta" data-href="Satipatthana Sutta" class="internal-link">Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta</a></span>_ - this is actually the instruction of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> - he's talking about what feeds the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> and what starves the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>.^[DN 22, MN 10. Also see SN 46:51] And we're clearly really interested in what starves the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > In jhana practice we want antidotes to work against the hindrances" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#In jhana practice we want antidotes to work against the hindrances" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
There's a slight kind of tilting, over the years of modern <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> teaching - but anyway. It's still a valid way of working at times, but in _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_, in _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ practice, no. We've got a different relationship, a different attitude. Again, watch out for the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>. Watch out for the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span>. If you have a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> of just, "Oh, it's just a hindrance. I'll just sit it out. I'll just watch it. It's okay. It's fine," we want to shake up that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span> a little bit, galvanize it. They're going to come. There's no way they're not going to come. If you come into an interview and you report to me that you just didn't have any <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>, I'd just say you're not paying <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>. Because at _least_ the subtle ones are going to come, no matter how much practice you've done, and usually, as I'll explain later, also the not-so-subtle ones<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Watch out for the habit of letting-be in standard mindfulness practice" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Watch out for the habit of letting-be in standard mindfulness practice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
So, rattling off through the antidotes, the two most common <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> are probably - they're given usually in a certain order, but let's start with the two most common, which are sloth and torpor, and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a></span> and worry. I'm just going to throw out a bunch, and if you think of one that I've forgotten that's actually really helpful, then just shout it out. We'll put them all in a pot for everyone to use. ^2-4
###### 2-5
**(1) Sloth and torpor**: getting sleepy is the extreme, the head nodding like that. But like all of these, it has a range, so just dullness, fogginess, sleepiness, etc., lack of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > 1 Sloth and torpor" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#1 Sloth and torpor" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-5
###### 2-6
**(a) Expanding the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>**. There's a reason why I say that over and over and over. It's so, so, so important. It will affect the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. It's impossible - if you're really expanding the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> and really filling it with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, it's actually quite hard to be nodding. There's something about it that's the opposite movement. So expanding the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> to the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span> and really filling it, again and again and again<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > a Expanding the awareness to the whole body" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#a Expanding the awareness to the whole body" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-6
###### 3-1
**(b)** As I've mentioned as part of a couple of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditations</a></span>, the in-<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> is naturally energizing. The out-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> is naturally relaxing. So that if I want, if I need more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, **a bit more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to the in-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>**, and a bit more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to the energization of the in-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> is going to energize things<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > b A bit more attention to the naturally energizing in-breath" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#b A bit more attention to the naturally energizing in-breath" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
**(c) A long <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>**, or longer <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, or very long <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> will also energize. It will energize the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. You can think of it as oxygen or whatever, but if you think in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> terms, it's just there's more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> there. And that will energize the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. So long <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, move to a long <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> - if you're working with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, of course<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > c A long breath also energizes the mind" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#c A long breath also energizes the mind" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2

**(d) If you're working**, let's say, **with** _**<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>**_, then again, what's going to help? Could it be that **going back in the categories to the easiest person** might actually lighten things up, bring a bit of brightness, just because the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ comes and it's easiest<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > d Giving metta to the easiest person brings a bit of brightness" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#d Giving metta to the easiest person brings a bit of brightness" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^3-3
###### 3-4
**(e)** Or might it be that **going to the difficult person**, because they're difficult, and the challenge of it keeps you awake<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > e Giving metta to the difficult person keeps you awake" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#e Giving metta to the difficult person keeps you awake" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^3-4
###### 3-5
**(f)** Or might it be that **expanding to all beings**, partly because of the spatial expansion - which I'll come back to in a second. The question is, do I need to **shift categories** if I'm doing _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ ? And which way? And it's not like it's always going to be _this_ one that's going to help. So I have to have that willingness to respond and experiment<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > f Giving metta to all beings creates a spatial expansion" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#f Giving metta to all beings creates a spatial expansion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-5
###### 3-6
**(g) More pegs**, okay? We talked about pegs in the counting, right? Bringing back those pegs really gives the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> - keeps it busy, gives it something to focus on. It literally keeps it up from sagging, okay? **With the numbers and the counting, they're like pegs. With the** _**<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>**_ **practice, if you're using phrases, the phrases are like pegs.** _What can often be really helpful in the_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ _practice - so let's say your first two phrases are "May you be happy" and "May you be peaceful." So usually you go, "May you be happy. May you be peaceful." Actually, if the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> needs a bit more pegs, if it needs more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, or if it's getting lost: "May you be happy. May you be happy. May you be peaceful. May you be peaceful." Say each one twice. First one, I'm not quite there. The second one, I'm a bit more there. So just small things like this, but they can make a lot of difference<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > g More pegs i e like in numbering practice or metta phrases" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#g More pegs i e like in numbering practice or metta phrases" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-6

**(h)** You can also just **imagine**, actually, let's say, **your <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span> filled with a bright, white light**, just like the sun - really, really useful. Again, when the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> gets tired, it gets dark, foggy<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > h Imaging your whole body filled with a bright white light" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#h Imaging your whole body filled with a bright white light" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-7
###### 3-8
**(i)** You can also **open up the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> very, very wide** - much wider than the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a></span> size, which is just a little bit bigger than the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a></span>. You can open it up to the size of this room. It's a lovely, huge room. Or even wider to the sky outside, etc. When we get tired, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> shrinks. It's actually what we do when we curl up and go to sleep: the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> pulls in on itself, in a way. And so, opening up that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, opening your eyes, open up the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. You have a sense of the whole room.

I mean, there's a place on your back, and it's almost like the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> and the sense of it comes, metaphorically, like someone just soothingly stroking your back, and that addresses the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a></span>. It soothes the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a></span>.

But within that, you have a job to do. And the job is, let go of your primary base object, and you **become aware of the sensations of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a></span>**, the actual prickly <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span> that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">arise and pass</a></span> in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> - you know, that sort of thing - in this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awareness" data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">big awareness</a></span>, and your job is **completely allowing them**, and they'll be, moment to moment, arising and passing, unpleasant - and **completely welcoming them**<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > f Largest awareness while completely welcoming the sensations of resetlessness" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#f Largest awareness while completely welcoming the sensations of resetlessness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-8

The whole system settles down, because we're then in a very different relationship with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a></span>. When <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a></span> comes up, we have <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> to the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a></span>.

When you go wide like that, and you come into a mode of completely allowing, completely welcoming, we're almost, by definition, quietening the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>. We're practising a non-aversive relationship. And it's that and the space that will really, really help. You just stick with it, stick with it, again and again. Actually, if you just do [that] - I remember playing with this years ago in the Hermitage, sitting - restless, restless, sitting while doing that - actually then ending up sitting for three hours, because that very practice just allowed everything to calm really, really, really down.

###### 5-1
**(a)** Let's talk about one particular kind of sense <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>: **sexual <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>**. Okay, there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> for someone, or whoever it is. You know, you can go and take a cold shower or whatever, but I'd just like to offer this as a real possibility, especially as one develops more, and you're all experienced meditators. So oftentimes, what happens is there's sexual <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, and it goes to an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of having sexual contact in some kind of way - I have this person, or whatever it is. That's the bit that's not so helpful for _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>._ But the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> itself and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, there's a way of working with it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > a Sexual desire" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#a Sexual desire" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1
###### 5-2
For instance: okay, here's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. It's gone to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> already. Is it possible to kind of feel the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> of sexual arousal? So I've got <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, I've got <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> (in the probably _not_ <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal sense</a></span>, but an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> there), and I've got sexual <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> or arousal. Of course, they're related. We could say you've got three things. Of those three, if I can focus on and open to, actually, and feel the _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>_ - so most people, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> comes up, and then the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> comes up, and then the feeling, and I'm lost in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. I'm lost in chasing this sexual <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span>. I'm embroiled in it. If I just can kind of **focus more on the _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>_ and actually _open_ to it, _allow_ that actual <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> in the space of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a></span>**, actually, it feels good. If it's not too tight, I open to it, and I enjoy it, it's actually quite close to _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a></span>_. It's quite close to the kind of good feeling. And oftentimes when people first <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a></span>_, they say, "Oh, it's like an orgasm." It doesn't have to be that intense, but there's a similarity there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Feel the energy of sexual arousal not the image and allow it into the space of the energy body" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Feel the energy of sexual arousal not the image and allow it into the space of the energy body" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2
###### 5-3
So what you're really doing is approaching this thing more energetically, feeling it, opening to it, and kind of riding it in a way that allows it to shape into something that's a more pure <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, which is actually very conducive and helpful to where we're going, or similar to where we're going anyway. I wouldn't necessarily, obviously, give that to complete beginners. But you guys have had a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, so if that's kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> coming up, that's good. It's a way of working with it. It can be very similar to _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a></span>_ if I can kind of filter things out and emphasize and open in the right way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Shaping the arousal into something thats more pure energy" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Shaping the arousal into something that's more pure energy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-3

###### 5-6
**(a) <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Ill-will</a></span>** means, actually, I'm getting really upset with someone here, so much so that I wish them harm. **(i) _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Mettā</a></span>_**, obviously. You switch - if it's really strong, you know, if <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> is your base practice, just switch to _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_. I need to deal with this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">ill-will</a></span>. I absolutely [need to], because when that's there, it's not going to help. It's really going to get in the way. **(ii)** But there's another possibility within that, which is: when I have <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">ill-will</a></span> towards someone, or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> towards someone, or I just don't like them, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is in that kind of nasty state (however gross or subtle), actually, what I can do then - so first thing, I think, "Oh, I give _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ to that person," which is great. That might really help. But there's a second possibility, which is actually, bring the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> back to myself without trying to change the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">ill-will</a></span> or how terrible this person is, or those kinds of thoughts and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span>. **Bring the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> back to myself, and actually notice and feel the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ of that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">ill-will</a></span> _here_ .** _It's in_ my _heart. There's a taste in my mouth. It's a flavour in my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a></span> and my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>. It's_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>. It's painful. So I'm not trying to change the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">ill-will</a></span>. I just come back, and I feel what's happening. Don't judge, just: "What does it feel like? Oh, it's _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_." And feel the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> of it. I just have to let my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> touch the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > a Ill-will i Metta to the one Im upset with ii to myself" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#a Ill-will i Metta to the one I'm upset with ii to myself" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-6
###### 6-1
If I'm doing that, if I'm just letting it touch it, then what can happen is, when I touch that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, when I come into contact, it turns into <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> for myself, okay? Self-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. You think, "Yeah, but my problem is with the other person." It doesn't matter. Once there's self-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. It's a new <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> in the system, and it will soften everything. So my self-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> starts changing my relationship with this other person.

**(b)** What can also happen - and what you will, I'm sure, notice happening over the course of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> - is that **we get aversive at certain noises**: the heating, or the birds, the rooks, which are a lot quieter than they used to be, say, ten or fifteen years ago, for some reason. And it's like, "Oh, those _crows_ are so _loud_," or whatever it is, and "I'm trying to meditate, and they're _bothering_ me." Or this person is just, "Every time they get up, their bones creak," like my bones creak or whatever, something, or their breathing. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a></span> at noise, which could include <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> at a person or another sentient being, or whatever it is<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > b Aversion towards certain noises" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#b Aversion towards certain noises" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-2
###### 6-3
**(i)** This is going to be really common, okay? I have to **remember the big picture, the goal**. Where am I going in practice? I'm certainly not going towards more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>. I'm going towards less <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>. That's what I want. It's not even _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ is my primary goal. **It's less <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, less _kilesa_, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> from the defilements.** _Just remind myself, "What do I want? **I want to get to a place where there's less <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, I'm less bothered by noise, I'm more open, there's more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>**, etc." So again, what does that imply about how I should practise the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a></span>_, and what kind of way I'm holding, and my view of the whole thing?

Not bothered, but not throwing out the baby with the bathwater: "Oh, I don't need to make an effort, then."

**(ii)** Sometimes what you can actually do is, again, **deliberately let the primary object go, and open up more to sound, and a sense of really including that**. And again, I'm doing the opposite thing of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>. I'm opening to sound and including it. I'm not saying, "Oh, that's _other_ than what I'm trying to do." I'm opening to sound, including it, and then that starts changing the way I feel about the sound. And then within that, keeping that openness, actually, then I can reintroduce the primary object, but I've got it in a much bigger space, and a much bigger attitude, a much bigger orientation<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ii Opening to the sound and including it" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#ii Opening to the sound and including it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-4

**(iii)** You know, technically, we'll get to this when we talk about the second _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_, but actually, technically, if in any moment, you could just quite significantly **turn down any <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>**, you would come very close to the second _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_. _Sukha_ would arise. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a></span> would arise. With a lot of practice - or actually, maybe, again, this is just one of those things. Just try. I say, well, just try. Sometimes I say, "Okay, just turn down the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>." You say, "What do you mean, 'turn down'? I don't know how to do it." Just try. Just try to turn down the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, because turning down the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> can then just directly give rise to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, give rise to _sukha_<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > iii Turn down any aversion in the mind which helps sukha to arise" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#iii Turn down any aversion in the mind which helps sukha to arise" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-5

**(5)** _Okay, last one: **doubt**. We can doubt the teacher, we can doubt the teachings, and we can doubt ourselves. There's probably lots of other stuff, but those are the three sort of common ones. So what's the difference between questioning and doubt? **Doubt often involves an absence of questioning**, in fact, or an absence of letting questions blossom and grow into an inquiry that's actually helpful. Doubt tends to paralyse. We get stuck in a kind of confusion or this and that. We're not actually questioning anything. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is just shuttling back and forth or going round in a circle. So sometimes, underneath all that, there's actually a question or two or three that need to get clarified and formulated, and perhaps asked to oneself or to a teacher. But we haven't let the question form yet. And we're just stuck in this kind of unclear shuttling back and forth. So _is_ there a question there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > 5 Doubt tends to paralyze" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#5 Doubt tends to paralyze" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^6-6

**Once we've got a question,** it's no longer paralysing. Even formulating it clearly will help. We'll feel unparalysed. And **then formulating and asking and engaging will be really helpful.** But doubt paralyses. And so, just one thing to bear in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is timing, here. **When am I going to wrestle with this either question or doubt? "Outside of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>" is the answer.** In other words, yeah, there's something I'm really not sure about. I'm confused. I have a question, and I can't proceed until I have an answer. Just, "This is my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> time, so I'm just going to put that aside. But I promise you, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, that I will get to this question, and I will think about it, I'll ponder it, I'll inquire, I'll ask something later." You make a deal with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. It's like, "We're going to get to this. I'm not ignoring it." But it happens outside of the formal practice<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Once weve got a question its no longer paralysing - but postponed to after formal practice" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Once we've got a question it's no longer paralysing - but postponed to after formal practice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-1

How many people have heard of the practice of **exchanging the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> of self and other**? A few of you. It's a huge practice, infinite possibilities. I think there's quite a large section about it in the book I wrote, _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Seeing That Frees" class="internal-link">Seeing That Frees</a></span>_.^[Rob Burbea, _Seeing That Frees: Meditations on Emptiness and Dependent Arising_ (Devon: Hermes Amāra, 2014), 322-6] At some point, you can visit that. I want to say it's a really, really beautiful practice. It's one of the most gorgeous explorations you can do as a meditator, and full of creative possibilities and lovely, luscious possibilities of transformation. In a nutshell, here I am, pretty miserable from some hindrance attack or whatever, and I say to myself, "You know what? I'll take this. I'll take this because somewhere, someone else - maybe someone I know, maybe someone I don't know and will never know - someone, somewhere else correspondingly, by magic, I'm taking their _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, and they can have the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>." So again, technically, you could say, well, what am I doing there? Instead of the automatic, natural <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>, I'm actually saying, "Come, come, I'll take this." But it has heart in it. It has this, "I'm willing to take this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> right now. I'm opening myself to the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> for the sake of the release from <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of someone else, somewhere." So it's a kind of, you could say, 'magical thinking' - it doesn't matter - using your imagination, whatever. There are all kinds of variations on that with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> and stuff, but that's the nutshell of it. It's a very beautiful thing<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Exchanging happiness of self and other" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Exchanging happiness of self and other" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-2

And often what happens, with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> around, is there's no heart as well. Everything's got squeezed, miserable, and there's no heart. One possibility is bringing the heart in, in that very beautiful way. So you could do that with physical discomfort as well: "I can take this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> right now.

Like I said, we have to get clear a few things about the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>: one is that there are subtle <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> as well. So everyone's used to really gross <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>, and it's generally what we get taught about when you first hear about the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> on <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span> and stuff like that. But they also manifest very, very subtly. And as I said, there's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sutta" class="internal-link">sutta</a></span> in the _Majjhima Nikāya_ where the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s talking, and he's talking about subtle <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="[hindrances" class="internal-link">[hindrances</a></span>], and he lists all these subtle <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>.^[MN 128] So things like elation and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, slight over-efforting, slight under-efforting - very, very slight, he's talking about. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a></span>, if it's not handled well. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a></span> of multiplicity - you know, just in a way, too much <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> of different things.

And in a way, there's always something to play with and work with and experiment with, something that can be tweaked a little bit<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > There are subtle hindrances to work and experiment with" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#There are subtle hindrances to work and experiment with" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-4

Of course, there are some times in _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice where all that goes, and we're not actually aware of any <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>. And that's fine. You don't have to go looking for them at that point. You just get into the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a></span> of it. As you get more into the territory of a _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_, then you start to realize the kind of more subtle <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> that might be there, or possibly be there at times, that at first you don't realize. It's not that we're always looking. We're not at all always looking for <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> with _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice. We're actually inclining more to what's pleasant and easeful, and enjoying.

Let me point out something else that I want to come back to on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and actually emphasize quite a lot. And it's something that, I think, gets clearer through _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice than through <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> practice. And it's a kind of very common micro-negativity of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. So you might be sitting there with a very nice <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a></span>. You might be sitting there with _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a></span>_, etc., whatever it is, and you might be quite used to it by that point. But it's still pretty nice. Most people would give their right arms for what you're experiencing in that moment. But you've experienced this kind of thing before, and "The other day it was _better_ than it was today." [laughter] And "I know it _can_ be a bit better." And in this kind of very subtle way, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is inclining towards what's wrong, what's not quite as good as it should be<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Micro-negativity of the mind" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Micro-negativity of the mind" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-2

Part of that is okay. It's part of the shaping. It's like, again, the potter with the clay on the wheel. Of course! "So what's wrong? It's not ... it's a bit sort of ..." I'm kind of pressing it. But when it has a flavour of [low complaining noises], when it has that negativity - we're talking, this can get _incredibly_ subtle. It's just a cup half-full, half-empty thing, but on a really, really subtle level. It's just this moment, there's something in the way I'm seeing this and relating to this actually really lovely thing, and I'm somehow spinning it with a negative - I'm seeing it through a negative lens. This is incredibly common, and it's what we might call, like, a really deep, deep, almost base-level _kilesa,_ defilement, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. This, you'll notice more and more as things go on, and it's something that's actually really important to address and work with<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Cup half-full half-empty on a really subtle level seeing through a negative lens" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Cup half-full half-empty on a really subtle level seeing through a negative lens" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-3

The really good news is that we notice this much more in - you'd think you'd notice it more in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> practice; you actually notice it much more in _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice. And you'll get much closer to it, and you'll see it working at a much, much subtler level, and you'll be able to do something about it. And what I want to say right now is - and I'll repeat this, and other things - we just notice it. Expect it, notice it, find the pleasure, get into enjoying it. Find what's nice, get into enjoying it. So we just make a micro-movement. We're talking about a micro-subtle defilement. We just make a micro-shift of relationship and attitude, yeah? But in a way, we could construe that as a subtle hindrance, absolutely<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Jhana practice helps you notice this micro-subtle defilements" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Jhana practice helps you notice this micro-subtle defilements" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-4

Okay, and again, in terms of subtle <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>, there are two forms called 'sinking' and 'drifting.' I don't know where these words come from. I don't know if they're originally in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>; I've never come across them in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>. I picked them up from - I think it was Kamalashila.^[Probably the modern Kamalashila rather than the eighth-century Kamalaśīla. For discussions of 'sinking' and 'drifting,' see _Kamalashila,_ Meditation: The Buddhist Way of Tranquillity and Insight, 2nd edn (Birmingham: Windhorse, 1996), 165-74] I can't remember. But they're around now in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma culture</a></span>. So, 'drifting' and 'sinking': what does that mean<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Sinking and drifting" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Sinking and drifting" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^8-5
###### 9-1
**(1) Drifting**_ _is a sort of subtle version of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a></span>, and really, what it means is, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is still alive, you're still <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a></span>, you're nowhere near, like, jumping out of your skin or anything like that, or obsessed with worrying, or that kind of thing. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is present. Everything's good. It's kind of with its object. But there's just a bit more tendency for it to drift off the object, or sometimes it manifests as just a bit more thoughts and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, and a little bit more tendency of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> to get pulled off into them. So again, we're talking about something quite subtle. **(2)** And **sinking** is the subtle version of sloth and torpor. Again, nowhere near nodding or falling asleep or anything like that; it's just a little bit of dullness comes in. It's not quite so present, so alive, so bright, so sharp<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > 1 Drifting a tendency to drift off objects 2 sinking being not quite so bright" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#1 Drifting a tendency to drift off objects 2 sinking being not quite so bright" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-1
###### 9-2
These are interesting <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>, because oftentimes, what they're most related to is effort levels. Again, we're back to this question, this issue of effort levels, and the fact that I cannot avoid that issue. I cannot avoid that parameter of practice. As you get deeper and deeper in _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_, a tiny bit too much effort, just a little bit too much effort, or a little bit less so, makes proportionately more of a difference, and more of an impact. In other words, again, the deeper we go, the more sensitive the whole system is. And a bit too much effort, a bit less effort actually kinds of gets in the way, or causes problems, has more of an effect at a deeper level. So with these subtle <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>, sinking and drifting, one of the things that's really worth paying <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to is just the effort levels, and seeing, like what we were saying earlier today, what is it just to back off the intensity? Or perhaps to move, in my directionality, from more of a probing to more of a receiving. In other words, what I wanted to say is, both sinking and drifting can arise from _either_ too much effort, very slightly, _or_ too little effort - paradoxically sounding. We don't know. What do you have to do? You have to just get in there and play, play with that subtle effort: bit more, bit less, bit more intense, bit less intense, bit more probing, bit more receiving, bit more delicate - you know, whatever it is<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Both drifting and sinking can come from either too much or too little effort" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Both drifting and sinking can come from either too much or too little effort" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-2
###### 9-3
And sometimes, one of the ways I like to think about this is, for example, with the drifting, why is there more thought? Why does the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> go? We're squeezing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> too tight, and (in a completely incommensurate <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>) it's a bit like squeezing a banana skin, and the banana comes shooting out. [laughter] Maybe that's not the greatest analogy. But again, going back to what we said before, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span> can reveal the effort. Even just the size of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> can also affect this<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Simile squeezing a banana" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Simile squeezing a banana" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-3

So there's lots of things to try, but one main point to take is the _spectrum_. We're really talking about a spectrum. When we talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>, we're really talking about a spectrum, despite what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> said as, "With the abandonment of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>, with seclusion from the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>, arises the first _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_." Yes, that's true, _and_ at another level, we're talking about a whole spectrum here that's not going to go away, in one form or another. Sometimes even in _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ - again, 'in' inverted [commas], using that word in a slightly loose way - you can be, here's the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>. Here's the brightness, the luminosity, and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, and it's as if at the edges of that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> and brightness, at the edges of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, there's like a whole little pack of little terrier dogs sort of yapping away.

We'll talk about all this. Now, it might be that in doing that, the terriers nicely quieten down and fall asleep or whatever. But it might be they stay there, and actually, that's as good as it's going to get right now. Okay. So I've got this really nice, lovely, yummy, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Juiciness" data-href="Juiciness" class="internal-link">juicy</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, which the person who gave their right arm for the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a></span>_ would now give their left arm as well for. And don't worry! The terriers are there. It's not a problem. Just get into and enjoy it. And don't worry about this 'in' and 'out' business. It's just how _not_ to consume the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> with questions that are not relevant. But also, sometimes, it's the terriers yapping, _da-da-da_, I'm kind of 'in,' _da-da-da -_ but let me go to the terriers, see what they need, and see if I can do something that encourages them to do something else. So it's not like there's always a formula, but one formula is: "It's okay. This is the deal right now. This is as good as it's going to get.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Simile terriers at the edge of awareness" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Simile terriers at the edge of awareness" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^9-5

Sometimes there are <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> in different forms. Sometimes a hindrance arises, just - is it a hindrance? No, it's just that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a></span> - it's not that my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is consumed with this or that. It's just that the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a></span> feels a little constricted or blocked. I'm not obsessed with this, I'm not thinking about that, I'm not lost in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> or doubt or any of that. It just feels a little bit blocked. We could call that a subtle hindrance, if you want. Or it's just that the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a></span> kind of won't settle down, or the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="citta" class="internal-link">citta</a></span>_ won't really settle down. It's not even from gross distraction or thought; it's something just a little agitated in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> of the _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="citta" class="internal-link">citta</a></span>_ or the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>.

Or sometimes - and again, this is something that may be for some of you, or _will_ be for some of you later, may be relevant for some of you now - sometimes it's amazing: if you have quite a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> in and out of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a></span>_, sometimes it's just like, it's almost like you can just dive underneath something. So here, this is blocked, or it doesn't feel right. Something's not settled. And like I said, it's a bit like the radio frequencies or the wardrobe: the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a></span>_ are there anyway, and you can kind of just point the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> to a level that's actually really peaceful. Now, it might not be pristinely, wonderfully, radiantly, overwhelmingly peaceful, but there's something that you recognize, like, "Well, _that's_ the kind of peace that belongs to the third _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_," let's say. I recognize that peacefulness. And you point the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, and you just dive underneath a little bit. It's there. And then I'm tuning to that. I'm not getting caught up. Yes, this part of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> doesn't feel quite connected, or feels a bit constricted, or the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> - so I'm just pointing to that, I dive into it, and then what's my work there? I've dived in. Now I'm in touch with that peacefulness. Now what? Now I need to work with that, get into it, enjoy it, open to it, focus on it, etc. We'll talk about more of that. So it's not _really_ that the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ is quite there, but something of a doorway to that, something of a trail of that _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ is there, and you can pick it up and just kind of point the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> there and dive into it - with practice, with time. So there it is. And once you get that trail or opening, then you work on staying there and stabilizing and absorbing into that, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > The jhanas are there anways you can point the mind to a peaceful level" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#The jhanas are there anways you can point the mind to a peaceful level" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-2

As I said, with _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice, we really want this attitude of working with - working _against_, if you like - the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>. We really want this idea of antidote. But we also really want this idea of patience. So I'm _patient_ while I'm _working with_. Really important. I'm playing with and experimenting with all that, and I can use all my ingenuity and creativity in how I relate to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> or what might help. And at the same time, I have a firm resolve. I'm not just going to give up now. I'm not just going to get up and walk away, or just sit through it and say, "Oh, whatever. Who cares." There's this combination of working actively, of being creative and ingenious, and a firm resolve and patience, all together<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Im patient while Im working with the hindrances" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#I'm patient while I'm working with the hindrances" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-3

So it's not that we want to get kind of locked into a grim battle for hours on end with some hindrance or another. At a certain point, it's like, "All right. You win the battle. You're not going to win the war, but you win this battle, and I'm going for walk," or "I'm going for a cup of tea." Part of that is also just taking the pressure off and opening the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. If I go for a walk, it's like the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>, the air, the light, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span> - I hope, by the end of this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, that everyone knows the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> of rain, because you get a lot of practice with that. There's no reason that bad (or so-called 'bad') weather should affect your <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Beauty" data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">sense of beauty</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Its ok to have the hindrance win the battle and just go for a walk" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#It's ok to have the hindrance win the battle and just go for a walk" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-1

In a way, what we're doing is, the emphasis is more on cultivating <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span> than kind of fighting the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>. We're doing both, but it's like, it's a certain way of thinking about it. That's the balance. And again, to those of you, or when you have more and more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, after you've got quite a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> in and out of different _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a></span>_, you sometimes just get a sense of what's possible in any moment. So maybe I'm working on the fourth _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_; it's where my playground is. But there are <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> around, whatever, and I'm kind of stuck in the first or second _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_, and you just get a sense: no, I can stay with this and shape it, and it will go deeper. Other times you get a sense: "This is as good as it's going to get right now." You just have a feel for it after a while. That takes practice. So still, that's great. You know, that's _really_ good. Just the fact that there's a subtle hindrance blocking you from getting as far as you've got before - no problem. You take what you can get, what's accessible, and you kind of develop a sense of (I don't know what an analogy would be) what's possible in any particular situation<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > The emphasis if more on cultivating well-being than fighting the hindrances" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#The emphasis if more on cultivating well-being than fighting the hindrances" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-2

All right. To finish, some things about **<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> in relation to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>**<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Insight in relation to the hindrances" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Insight in relation to the hindrances" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-3

**(1)** One thing I've already said: **the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> are spectra**. They're not on/off. There's a spectrum for each hindrance in terms of really, really gross, more and more, more and more subtle. That's partly just like, I know that, I understand, that's the territory that I'm dealing with. Partly, that has a couple of implications. One is that they will be common visitors. They will be coming and going. If I have the view that "They shouldn't be," or "They won't be," or "After a certain amount of practice, or once I've reached X _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>,_ it won't happen," that's the opposite of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. That's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>. So there's just a certain amount of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> in recognizing they're spectra, and that means, in one form or another, in one level on the spectrum of grossness or subtlety, they will be coming. I'm aware of that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > 1 There is an insight of understanding that there is spectrum for each of the hindrances" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#1 There is an insight of understanding that there is spectrum for each of the hindrances" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-4
###### 11-5
**(2)** Second thing is, **it's not linear**. Yes, they'll be coming and going, and they'll be coming and going even after you reach whatever _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_, you know, in terms of what's part of your practice. You might, in other words - how to say this? You could have a much harder time with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> later on in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> than you did earlier, or something. Or you feel like, "Now I've got to this _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ now. It was going so well, and then suddenly, I'm just in a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hell" data-href="Hell" class="internal-link">hell realm</a></span>," or whatever. I've said this before in many other talks. If someone comes in to me and they're doing _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ practice, and they just describe this kind of smooth ascent, day by day, into the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Heaven" data-href="Heaven" class="internal-link">Tuṣita heavens</a></span>, kind of uninterrupted linear graph like that, either they're lying, or they're, again, really not paying <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>. It's more like _this_ : okay, there's a trend, yeah, but it's more like _this_. [non-linear hand gesture] Actually it's more like _this_. [different non-linear gesture] We'll explain. But it's not linear. So again, just because (I'll come back to this in a minute) we had a great time for the last five days, and all this stuff was opening up, it doesn't mean that I'm not going to fall down a hole into the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> tomorrow, or that they will not visit. Let's say that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > 2 Its not linear" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#2 It's not linear" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-5
###### 12-1
**(3)** Third piece about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> here is, we want to help ourselves to **get to a relationship with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> where we're really not taking them personally**. They are aspects of being human, until, apparently, one is an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">arahant</a></span>, and that means fully <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightened</a></span>. They're aspects of being human. _Taking personally_ - what I mean by that is, "Oh, I'm a bad meditator," or "This means that I'm" - even worse - "a bad person, because I keep getting this or that hindrance. I keep getting <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>," or "I keep getting <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. I'm really greedy," or "I'm this or that." <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a></span> - don't take them personally. They're a human thing. They're like facts of being human, and the arising of a hindrance doesn't mean anything about my capability as a meditator or my worthiness as a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>. That's really, really important. So, can I encourage that attitude? And that's part of where we want to move towards. That's part of the gift of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice. We begin, after a while, to see: it's not personal. But we want to really encourage that, not taking it personally<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > 3 Do not take the hindrances personally they are a fact of being human" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#3 Do not take the hindrances personally they are a fact of being human" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-1
###### 12-2
**(4)** The second thing, again, we want to move towards - this is the fourth <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> piece now - is that we, more and more, **believe the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a></span> that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> spin less and less**. So less and less, over time, do we believe the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a></span> that the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> spin. What happens is a hindrance arises, and we get convinced that it's actually about this person, that they are the problem. It's not the problem of my hindrance. It's about them. Or it spins a story about me, and oftentimes then it spins this whole _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_ thing, that whole <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">proliferation</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > 4 Believe the stories that the hindrances spin less and less" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#4 Believe the stories that the hindrances spin less and less" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-2
###### 12-3
Actually what's happening is a seed of a hindrance arose, which is what happens for human beings. These hindrance seeds just keep coming up - defilement seeds, _kilesa_ seeds, greed, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span> - in one form or another, manifest as the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>. They're little seeds. And then without <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, those seeds become huge, huge trees, forests, jungles - jungles, better. Partly what allows them to become a jungle, those seeds, is _believing_ them: believing what they tell us, believing the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>, believing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a></span> that they spin. This is _so_ crucial. As I said, if nothing else happened on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, you didn't have a millisecond of an ounce of a nice feeling, but _that's_ what happened on the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, that's really, really good. That would make a huge difference in your life - huge difference<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Hindrances proliferating manifestations of kilesa seeds" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Hindrances proliferating manifestations of kilesa seeds" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-3
###### 12-4
**(5)** And the fifth <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> piece is that, in relation to what I just said, we actually **view the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>**: yeah, they're really unpleasant, but in a way, they're **kind of like gold dust or gold ore. There's something really precious here. I just need to find the right relationship with it.** I can turn it into treasure _if_ I find the right relationship with it, in terms of view and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span>. So they're really like gold dust, like something unrefined and filled with all kinds of not-so-great stuff. But actually there's a treasure there, because as I said, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> will come up in life. It's not just something in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>. We think about, what about that creative project? What about that service project? What about your work? What about coming up in long-term relationship? Same things arise. The same <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> arise, and they will get in the way of, they will 'hinder.' _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Nīvaraṇa</a></span>_ is the Pali. It's literally what it means: something that's an obstacle, gets in the way of a going forward. They will do that in all of those other realms of our life. It's not just something about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>. If I can get wise to them, if I can learn how to view them in a way that they lose their power - they might still arise as seeds, but they lose their power - that's absolutely huge, and absolutely precious<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > 5 Hindrances are gold ore theres something really precious here" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#5 Hindrances are gold ore there's something really precious here" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-4

And part of that is, also, I begin to understand something about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> as well. And this is really interesting. Something that seemed like "It's this emotion that I'm feeling," I actually see, "Oh, sometimes it's actually just a seed of a hindrance. And the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> has spun that into a story, and a certain emotion has arisen. But actually, in its root, it was just this hindrance, or mostly this hindrance." Sometimes. So there's something about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> that is actually really important in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> our emotional life.

The fact that they're spectra - there's a range - is part of this development of subtlety, because I recognize, they're going to get more subtle. My <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> has to get more subtle to even pick up on subtle <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>, and then work with them. So when we talked yesterday about how, I would say, it's so important, this development of subtlety and refinement and discrimination - that also happens in regard to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>. In terms of our overall trajectory, this recognition and working with the subtlety of the spectrum of the hindrance is also part of that whole development of subtlety. Yes, it's much nicer, attuning and discerning to subtle differences of _this_ kind of exquisite peacefulness versus _that_ kind of exquisite peacefulness, but in terms of developing the whole subtlety - which again, is so important for our emotional life and all the rest of it - that's important too. It's all subtlety. It's all discrimination.

In terms of not taking <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> personally and not believing them, can you hear that that's about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span>? It's about having <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> into what they are. I see you, what you are, and I let go.

Last thing: if you do enough of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice, what you'll begin to notice is what seems like a kind of backlash - it's as if it's going really well, and maybe even a new territory opens up. I've gotten to a new opening or a new state or a new wonderful thing happened. And I'm in that for a little while, however long that little while is - half a day, three days, or whatever it is, a few hours, even - and then all <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hell" class="internal-link">hell</a></span> breaks loose. And sometimes it can seem like, it's almost like the very opening caused a kind of backlash, that there was a kind of reaction to it somehow. It's not like every time, kind of expect it, but there seems to be something like that. There seems to be<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Backlash after it had been going really well" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Backlash after it had been going really well" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-4

And it raises a lot of questions. I mean, again, I need to expect it, etc., don't take it personally, and it's not linear, all that. But is there some kind of catharsis, some kind of purification going on here? I know people who have exactly that view: that what we're doing in _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice is somehow allowing a kind of karmic purification of our _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sankhara" data-href="Sankhara" class="internal-link">saṅkhāras</a></span>_ and our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>. Some people have that view<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Is this some kind of catharsis purification like some traditions say" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Is this some kind of catharsis purification like some traditions say" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-5

I would be a little more cautious. So I don't want to rule that out, but I would rather take both views: yes and no. Again, if I step back from that, what we want is a range. Remember this thing I said? I want you to have a range. Do you remember me saying that? I want you to have a range in regard to your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>. We want this range in relationship to our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>, and with regard to the ways of working and the ways of viewing emotion. I would like you to have a really big range. I can work with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> in lots of different ways. I can view <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> in lots of different ways. And I have a whole range of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> as well<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > I want you to have a range in rgard to your emotions" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#I want you to have a range in rgard to your emotions" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-6

But if there's a lot of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice, and if we're allowing that _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice - over a long time, I mean - to give rise to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, we will begin more and more to recognize the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>. We tend to think, "An emotion is a real thing. It arises by itself. It's there. And it's just sort of, I have to deal with that because it's a truth." Over time - we may or may not get more into this, and I know it's a sensitive [topic] - but it becomes almost undeniable that an emotion is a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. Without me _doing_ something, usually unconsciously, it cannot arise as that emotion. It cannot get <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span>. It cannot get constructed. So in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s words, we "see a hindrance as a hindrance,"^[Cf. the Buddha's statement at DN 22: "One dwells seeing phenomena as phenomena in terms of the five hindrances" _(dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati pañcasu nīvaraṇesu)_] and not necessarily as an emotion. We recognize what's there. It's a '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>,' or in other language, it's actually 'empty.' An emotion is empty<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Over time it becomes almost undeniable that an emotion is an fabrication" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Over time it becomes almost undeniable that an emotion is an fabrication" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-7
###### 14-1
But if you remember back to the first night, I said, "I can see an emotion as empty, and I can see it as real." I'm not parking in either one. I have the possibility to shift between views. To me this is absolutely crucial. Most often, people park in either one, and that becomes their view. For me, it would be catastrophic and tragic to _only_ ever have the view, _always_ have the view that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> are <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrications</a></span>. I would _never_ want to _only_ have that view. But both views become available. And therefore the view of catharsis, the view of, "Yes, something is purifying here. I may not even know what, but I sit through it as a purification," and then I have a whole stance with that and relationship with it - or the view that "It's _not_ that. They're <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrications</a></span>, and I need to get interested in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>." They're both there. But as we practise certainly _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a></span>_ more and more, we begin to "see a hindrance as a hindrance" more and more, as the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> might say<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > I can see an emotion as empty or see it as real Im not parking in either one" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#I can see an emotion as empty or see it as real I'm not parking in either one" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-1

And what happens, as we said, is it's not linear. It's very up and down. But there is a movement, over a long time with _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice, that what might manifest more as _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span> -_ like really extreme agitation, and lostness in story, and believing everything, and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span> and all that - actually begins to manifest less as _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_, and more as just pure hindrance. So over time, there's this kind of sifting away, filtering away of the more _papañcizing_ element of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. And it becomes: "It's just the hindrance." It might still be quite strong; I'm really quite restless in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, but there's no story attached to it. There's no lostness. What was usually _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_ becomes more just, "I'm just dealing with a hindrance now." And then over time, even the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> themselves - more and more, they tend to be on the subtle side of things, but they're still there. So, over a long time of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice, there is this movement of shaving away the gross, getting down to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>, and then even more subtle. But they stay. They're part of the deal. And we need to be okay with that, really up for that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Over time self-view manifest less as papanca and more as pure hindrance" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Over time self-view manifest less as papanca and more as pure hindrance" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-2
