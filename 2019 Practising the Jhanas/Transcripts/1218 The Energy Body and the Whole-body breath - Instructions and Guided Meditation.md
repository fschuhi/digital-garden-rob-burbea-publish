As I mentioned last night, the first - I don't know - five or six (something) days will be quite dense with teachings, and then it should get a little more sparse. So again, it's quite a lot to get through. Fortunately, there are only _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> people on tea wash-up tonight, so if we go a little into the teatime, it shouldn't really affect anything, because those tea wash-uppers will go as a team to do that, right? But let's see how we do. It shouldn't be that long<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > The first days will be quite dense with teachings" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#The first days will be quite dense with teachings" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1

Okay. I want to start with a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditation</a></span> in a minute, and then talk some after that. Again, as I mentioned last night, it doesn't really matter how you get to Newton Abbot, and you can go in what look like completely opposite directions, and you still get to Newton Abbot. And actually, they take roughly the same time or whatever<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > All roads lead to Newton Abbot" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#All roads lead to Newton Abbot" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2

So yesterday we offered this counting that, for most of you, will have been unfamiliar. I think tomorrow and the next day we'll offer techniques which are much more familiar, involving concentrating, focusing on the sensations that go with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> at certain points in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. The classical ones are upper lip, or nose, or in the abdomen. So we'll also offer that in this kind of buffet or smorgasbord, whatever, of what might work for you. And there are certainly possibly other practices that we're not even mentioning that are viable, that may work really well. Yeah, definitely. We'll offer a few<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > A smorgasbord of practices" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#A smorgasbord of practices" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3

So if you don't like this business about whole-<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, don't worry. We will get to a much narrower focus as an alternative, not as a better or worse - as a perfectly equal, viable alternative. We'll get to that another time. But today, I do want to go a little bit more into what I call the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, or working with the whole-<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> is a big subject, and it's actually quite hard to sum it up in a sort of pithy sentence. It's a concept that grows, that's elastic, that has all kinds of avenues to it. But what I want to talk about today a little bit is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> for _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_, okay? For those purposes. And I'm just going to say a little bit. I'm not going to do a whole exhaustive thing<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Today more about the energy body working with the whole-body breath" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Today more about the energy body working with the whole-body breath" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4
###### 1-5
Two terms to get a little bit used to: one is '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>.' When I say '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>' on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, what I mean - and I'm not going to say it every time, so every time you hear '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>' from now on, what it means is your felt sense, in the moment, of this whole space, actually a little bit bigger than your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a></span>. That whole space, that's what 'the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>' means, and the felt sense. So when I say "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>," "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>," that's what I mean, okay? A bit bigger, a bit larger than your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a></span>. But I'm really talking about the _felt sense_ of that whole space, okay? So '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>' is shorthand for that. If I mean something else, I'll try and say, "No, I really mean your toes," or whatever it is<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Whole body your felt sense of the physical space of the body actually a bit bigger" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Whole body your felt sense of the physical space of the body actually a bit bigger" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-5

Okay. That's one vocabulary term. Another is just '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>.' What does this mean? Some of you are very familiar with this, some a lot less. Again, it's hard to pinpoint what actually is meant by that, but if we just start very simply, it's the vibration, the feeling, the texture, or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> of this, of that space. That's really what we're talking about when we say that, just as an introductory idea. So texture, vibration, feeling, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> is slightly different than what we're used to: I can feel the sensations of my backside pressing on the chair, or if I stub my toe, I feel those sensations. They're slightly different kinds of sensation. So we're actually talking about something that's a little bit more subtle. I remember being taught this by a monk when I was living in the States, and then going on a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahasi Sayadaw" data-href="Mahasi Sayadaw" class="internal-link">Mahāsi</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and having an interview with the teacher there, and explaining to him how I was working with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> with this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>. Of course they're very into <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahasi Sayadaw" data-href="Mahasi Sayadaw" class="internal-link">Mahāsi tradition</a></span> and all that. He said, "What are you actually _paying <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>_ to?" So even for a long-term meditator, it was a bit of a baffling concept. Certainly in our wider culture, it's like, "What do you _mean_ when you say 'vibration,' 'texture,' 'feeling,' '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>'?" We're not trained with the kind of quality or poise of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> that reveals that kind of realm or stratum of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. It's just not <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">in our culture</a></span>. I mean, it's _getting_ in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> culture, but like that story says about that teacher, it wasn't around. It's [around] a little bit more now<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Energy body is the vibration texture feeling energy of the whole body space" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Energy body is the vibration texture feeling energy of the whole body space" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-6
###### 2-1
So texture, feeling, vibration, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, as opposed to sensation of contact or that kind of thing. But even this, these are vague terms, and it's more pointing in a certain direction, in which hopefully your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> will begin to open up, and you start to get more familiar and confident with all that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Vague terms but pointing in a certain direction" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Vague terms but pointing in a certain direction" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
Second aspect that I would like to pinpoint about when we say <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>: the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of the body</a></span> - and especially as we're talking about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> for _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ - the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of the body</a></span> is integrated. This area, this space, feels like one whole, as opposed to "my feet are kind of over there, and my head is up here, and it's all made of bits." As we move, certainly as we move towards _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_, towards _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_, it gets more and more integrated. It really feels like one <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> area, one realm or one texture of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. So we could define '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>' like that, or let's be a little bit more helpful, I think, and just say that's the direction. It's going towards this sense of an integrated space, an integrated <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> area<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > The sense of the body is integrated" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#The sense of the body is integrated" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
Secondly, for integration, and related, is homogeneity - like milk, you know, homogenized. What's homogenous there? Not only is the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>_ homogenous, or tending more and more towards homogeneity, but the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>_, too, is homogenous - meaning I have less and less of a feeling of my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> being _up here_ [in the head area], kind of peering down at my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, _down there_ somewhere. It's more like the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> inhabits equally, homogenously, the whole space, and even a little bit bigger. So the whole thing is integrated and homogenized. And we could make that a _definition_ of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body awareness</a></span>, but let's just make it - this is the _direction_. This is what we're kind of working towards. After a while, that just becomes the norm. It just immediately is integrated and homogenized. But like so many things in _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_, we kind of ease it toward. That's what we're working towards<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Homogeneity of experience but also of awareness" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Homogeneity of experience but also of awareness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
Let me say something else before we do our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>. I've noticed [this], and it may be true for other people apart from me. So again, we're talking about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> with respect to _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_. Now, _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ is a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a></span>. It has a direction. It has a goal that we're interested in. We're wanting to develop something. We can relate to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> just, "How does it feel?", "What's happening there?", "Oh, that's interesting. Can I accept that? Can I open to it?", etc. That's fine. That's one way of relating to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>. But with the whole _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ practice, we're actually interested: can I coax this space, this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>? Can I coax it into something nice? Can I encourage that? There's a directionality and a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Samadhi practice is coaxing the energy body into something nice" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Samadhi practice is coaxing the energy body into something nice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 3-1
So with respect to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, with respect to _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_, it may be - in terms of how coaxable it is, what actually is possible to open up - it's actually much more sensitive in this context to something like temperature of your <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a></span>. So sometimes I wrap in blankets, or it's a cold day, so wearing a sweater, etc. I've noticed that if I dress like I would be comfortable in the house or wherever I am, or put a blanket on if I'm kind of like, "Yeah, it's a little cool," put a shawl on or whatever, I don't feel too warm. I feel fine. I feel comfortable. When I come to the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ practice, if I take that shawl off, a lot more opens up. Now, it's not like I take it off and then I'm shivering and my teeth are chattering. It's the kind of difference that usually I wouldn't even think about, I wouldn't need to make. If it's a hot day - let's say it's really hot, and I'm sitting in a t-shirt, and it's uncomfortably hot - this doesn't happen. So it's something, weirdly, to do with the shawl or the sweater or whatever<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Sensitivity to temperature" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Sensitivity to temperature" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
So I may be the only <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> that that is the case for, but I would encourage you, again, to experiment. Careful of that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>. You might have the opposite. You might find that, "Actually, no. I need to be a little warmer." So what's the criteria? It's not, "Am I comfortable? How do I like it?" I don't like cold. I don't have anything apart from skin and bones, for a start, and my ancestry is North African, so I don't like cold. But it's not about that. We're always interested in what helps the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body experience</a></span>. It's this ongoing experiment. What helps? Check. Know yourself. You have to be willing to experiment with something like this. I'm just throwing that out as a little thing<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Experiment be careful of that inertia" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Experiment be careful of that inertia" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
Okay. Let's do a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditation</a></span> to start, and I'll talk later. ^3-3
###### 3-4
(12:38, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditation</a></span> begins) ^3-4
###### 3-5
It's worth taking those few extra moments to really find that posture. Again, don't be lazy about this. Are you sitting, are you doing, just how you usually do, without paying much <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to it? Or are you taking the trouble to really find ...? It _feels_ a certain way. When the posture reflects that kind of ideal balance between uprightness, alertness on the one hand, and openness, softness, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a></span> on the other hand, it actually _feels_ a certain way. We need to get it in the groove, and then, actually, you'll feel that affect your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. So it's worth taking the trouble. Even if you've been meditating for thirty years, it's worth just finding that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Really find in your posture that balance between uprightness and receptivity" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Really find in your posture that balance between uprightness and receptivity" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-5
###### 3-6
Again, starting by feeling the posture, feeling that balance of qualities that are beautiful - dignity, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nobility" class="internal-link">nobility</a></span> - that are expressed by that balance between those complementary faculties of the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="citta" class="internal-link">citta</a></span>_ or qualities of the _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="citta" class="internal-link">citta</a></span>_. There's actually a poise, an uprightness, a firmness in the balance. It feels balanced, and it affects the _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="citta" class="internal-link">citta</a></span>_. Feel the openness. Feel the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a></span>, the softness in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. Can you make it a little bit more open, a little bit more soft right now? What would you change? Can you feel the uprightness, the resolution, the alertness in the posture? What would you change to make it more right now? Subtle changes. Are you _willing_ to change something in the posture right now<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Can you make the posture it a little bit more open" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Can you make the posture it a little bit more open" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^3-6
###### 3-7
So feeling the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> of the posture. And then, when you're ready, opening up the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> to embrace, to include, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>. What that means, again, is that whole space, a little bit bigger than your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a></span>. Just getting a felt sense of what that whole space feels like. Inhabit the whole space. Bright, alive sensitivity permeating, pervading that whole space<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Feel the beauty of the posture then open up the awareness to include the whole body" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Feel the beauty of the posture then open up the awareness to include the whole body" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-7
###### 3-8
So you don't have to get rid of any <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of your physical form, your hands, your legs, your toes, if that's there, but you also don't have to reinforce it. What we're more interested in is the felt sense, the texture, the vibration of this space. So not a problem if there's an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, but you don't have to reinforce it either. Eventually, that begins to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span>. How does it feel? So the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> will keep shrinking. It will shrink a thousand times. And just keep opening it out to just a little bit bigger than the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a></span> space, and fill that with alive <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, presence<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > We are interested in the felt sense not so much the image of the physical form" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#We are interested in the felt sense not so much the image of the physical form" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-8

So it's not just your ribcage and your lungs; the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>, that whole space, including where your feet would be, your head - places we don't usually think of as breathing.

Now let's try one thing. If you can, imagine the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> coming into the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> at the solar plexus. So obviously, usually we think of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> coming in the mouth, the nose. Just imagine it coming in at the solar plexus. That's, maybe, even a kinaesthetic imagination. And this long <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> coming in at the solar plexus, longest <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>. How does that feel? How does it make the whole space feel, the in-and out-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, the longest <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> in and out, there at the solar plexus? How does it affect the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>, the whole space? Maybe you notice it's just the same expansion and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span>, or energization/relaxation. That's great. If that's what you notice, then tune into that, just as you've been doing<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Imagine the breath coming into the body at the solar plexus" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Imagine the breath coming into the body at the solar plexus" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-8

But people are different, and some people notice as if the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> comes in there, perhaps, and there are currents that ripple out or emanate out from the solar plexus with the in-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, for instance going _down_ the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and _up_ the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> at the same time. The wave or the current of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, the double current, up the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and down the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, from this point of the solar plexus. So you may notice that. How does that feel, if you _do_ notice it? No problem if you don't notice something like that. You might want to try imagining it. Can you imagine the feeling, a kinaesthetic imagination, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> coming in at the solar plexus, and currents going simultaneously in opposite directions, up the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and down the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>? Just play.

How does it feel? Over and over, opening the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, sensitive to the whole space, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>.

Last thing to try for now. You may want to stay with that point in the solar plexus, or just go back generally to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>. It really doesn't matter. Whatever you feel works for you right now. But put a question in there, as something to experiment with: what length of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, what kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, really feels best right now - actually gives you the nicest feeling in that space, allows the space, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>, to feel most pleasant? And it might just be comfortable. So is it keeping this really longest <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>? Is it a very short <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>? Is it somewhere in between? Is it a kind of very, very subtle <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, or a grosser <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>? Smooth or coarse? What feels best right now? What way of breathing feels best right now? You have to experiment<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > What length of breath feels best right now" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#What length of breath feels best right now" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2

So not just your default way of breathing. Not just let it go, "It feels comfortable because I'm used to it." Not just the default. Play. Experiment. It might be that this longest <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, and the way it really opens up the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, that's what feels really good right now, or even a little bit good. Or it may be that a much shorter, subtler <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> feels somehow, perhaps, more soothing, or more gentle, and that's what feels really good right now, or somewhat good. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Whole body</a></span> space. Feeling how the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, how the different kinds of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, make that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span> space feel.

Okay, so let's just briefly recap what we just did. These are things to play with, things to experiment with, if you want. You may find some or all of them useful at different times, and you incorporate, or none of them - whatever. So the posture: even if you've been meditating for thirty years, it's really worth taking the trouble. After a while, posture matters less for _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_, but at the beginning, it's going to matter a lot, and this balance thing. So that's one thing. I'm not going to repeat what I said about '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>,' etc.; just what we did in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>. Longest <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, in this case, we started with - it doesn't have to be. The same principles apply. Three kinds of things to pay <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to: **(1) the expansion and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> of the whole space**. Not just your ribcage, but the whole space, and it feels a certain way. **(2)** Second thing: **the energization and relaxation, again, that you can feel in the whole space**. **(3)** The third aspect, actually, which we'll pick up again, is the possibility that, **within that whole space, you notice certain currents of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>**. Some do, some don't. And if you find that you just imagine them and then you can feel them, great, and it feels good, and feels helpful - just go for it. Imagine them<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Recap; three kinds of things to pay attention to" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Recap; three kinds of things to pay attention to" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-7
###### 6-1
So those three things to work with, and then this piece about what way of breathing feels good right now - the longest, very short, coarse, smooth, etc. So often, we just go into a default <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, and the only reason it feels comfortable is just because we're used to it. At that moment, it may well _not_ be that helpful in terms of really energizing, and opening, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span>, and soothing, and moving towards _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_. So we have to be, again, willing to let go of our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>, if it's there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Also what way of breathing feels good right now" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Also what way of breathing feels good right now" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-1

Okay. I don't know - I'm not sure the right name, but I remember taking lots of yoga classes years ago, and stuff like that, and there's a way that some teachers would encourage us to breathe while we were doing the postures. So it goes like: [strained breathing sound]. Yeah, _ujjayi_. No, we don't want it. Why? Because, great as it might be for all that other stuff, it keeps the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> coarse. That's why you _hear_ it, because it's coarse. And again, like I said yesterday, _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ is more dependent on open-heartedness than focus. I said that yesterday, right? I'm also going to say _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ is really about increasing subtlety and refinement, much more than it is about focus. I want to emphasize that, and I'll explain why as we go on. So if I'm keeping the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> kind of coarse, either just because I'm used to it or whatever, or because - I don't know - it's a sound that I've associated with breathing or whatever in a certain way, I'm actually preventing myself deepening in _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_, because the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> needs to get subtle, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> needs to get subtle. The journey of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_, the journey into _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a></span>_, is a journey into increasing refinement and subtlety, and we could say it's more _that_ than it is into increasing ability to nail your <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> to something and stay there all day, or whatever it is. Changing the view here for most people, who think very differently about what we're doing<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Samadhi is more about open-heartedness subtlety and refinement than focus" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Samadhi is more about open-heartedness subtlety and refinement than focus" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-2

As I emphasized, with the length of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, and the kind of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> - and we'll get more into this, if you're experimenting - what we want is a sensitivity that permeates the whole space, and a responsivity, a responsiveness: I'm willing to respond to what feels good, what feels less good. Sensitivity, responsiveness, and willingness to experiment and play. So those principles - sensitivity, response-ability, and willingness - right now, we're talking about them in regard to the length of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> and the kind of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>. As we go on, and get more and more, and deeper and deeper, those same qualities - sensitivity, responsivity, and willingness - start to apply to more and more aspects of the whole movement of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ and the deepening of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_. We become sensitive in relation to this, this, this, this, this, this, this, and responsive in relation to this, this, this, this, this, this, and willing to experiment and play. So right now, we're just talking about length and kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, but those principles are absolutely key, and they're the _opposite,_ again, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span> (that we talked about yesterday)<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > We want a sensitivity that permeates the whole space" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#We want a sensitivity that permeates the whole space" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-3

You get a sense of what gear is actually helpful now. I _could_ stay in this gear to go up this hill, but it's going to be a lot of work, you know? _This_ gear feels better. Or when I'm going downhill, you know? Or if you've improvised <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> with someone, or improvised dance with someone, it's got to be exactly what I've just said: sensitive, responsive, and willing to try stuff and do stuff differently. If you're improvising a dance together, or you're improvising <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> together, or whatever it is, or theatre or something, if you're making <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, it's got to be that. I mean, it can _not_ be that, but then your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> together, or you and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, or you and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, is going to be a lot more limited, right? So these are really key principles, opposite of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>, opposite of whatever is the default<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Simile riding a bike with gears; improvised dance" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Simile riding a bike with gears; improvised dance" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-1

Okay. Let me say something. I'll say it now, because I might forget to say it at the end, okay? It really should go at the end, but I'll say it now. In between formal practices - so in between sitting and walking, and when you're just moving around or whatever - as I said last night, what we want is a general kind of whole-<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, a general sort of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> of this. Remember what '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>' means? It's how this whole space feels. If you can get the kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body sense</a></span> within that, great. But at least to start, the whole-<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, and a general, light kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, okay? This is very relaxed though. So I said yesterday about not too slow, not too fast, etc., just to help. But what I'm talking about is a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> as I'm moving through the day: as I'm in the lunch queue, as I'm doing my job, there's this whole-<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, but the whole feel of it is quite relaxed and open. So again, sometimes we get used to paying <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> in a way that's a bit tense, a bit heavy. You can almost _feel_ someone like that, when they're in that mode. If you can get a sense, it's like the space feels relaxed. It's not heavy, intense <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>. Intense <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> has its place, and we'll talk about that - the energization of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>. But what I'm really talking about as we move around is a kind of open, easeful <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, and an open, easeful <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, and they go together. So it may not sound like a big deal, but if I've got that a little bit wrong, again, I'm not actually allowing the whole dough to rise here; I'm not allowing the process to cook properly<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > During the day aim for a whole-body awareness that is quite relaxed and open" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#During the day aim for a whole-body awareness that is quite relaxed and open" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-2

So again, the question - it becomes a question, as a seed inside: what helps? Right now, in this moment, what helps me to get into that kind of poise, as I'm moving around, as I'm going to the toilet, whatever I'm doing? That kind of relationship, that kind of state of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body awareness</a></span>. What kind of stance or pressure do I have to have? Do I need to kind of loosen off and relax a little bit, or actually do I need to bring and cohere my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> a bit more? So always there's a question, and the question invites us into this playfulness, responsiveness, sensitivity - the whole deal<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Again the seed question what helps" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Again the seed question what helps" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-3

And, in addition to that, as I said last night, just to say it again, we're also, as we're moving around, in between formal practices, we're cultivating, supporting, and inclining the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="citta" class="internal-link">citta</a></span>_, the heart and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, towards <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a></span>. We're taking care of that base - <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span>, in the deep sense, in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a></span>; <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span>; _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">muditā</a></span>_, as we said. Yeah<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Cultivate the citta towards appreciation mudita" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Cultivate the citta towards appreciation mudita" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^7-4

Okay. That was longer than I anticipated, but shall we break that, then? Thanks. ^7-5
