###### 1-1
Okay. As I mentioned, we're going to be offering, in the first - I don't know - five days or so, quite a few different practices for you to try, or not. Like I said, if you already know Newton Abbot, it's fine. It's okay. But still, some of them can be really worthwhile. This one I want to offer tonight, it seems that it's not that well-known, so it might be quite new to most of you, maybe. It involves counting with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>. Like I said, it may be <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> isn't even your thing, it turns out, but that's fine. We're just offering some things<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > In the fist days we will offer a few different practices today counting with the breath" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#In the fist days we will offer a few different practices today counting with the breath" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1
###### 1-2
Now, many people are familiar with counting. You count breaths up to ten, right? That's quite common. Or you just count indefinitely - 3,790 ... Or one counts up to ten, and then sometimes one counts before the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, or after the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, right? That's quite familiar? Yeah? What I want to do now is count _within_ the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>. For example, if I take a long <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, for the duration of that long <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, I can count: one, two, three, four, five, etc., down till nine. And then at nine, at the cusp of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, at the turning point of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, when that's the longest comfortable <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, the longest possible comfortable <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, then I turn it around: nine, eight, seven, six. And then if I do a slightly shorter <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, I can do a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> that, at the same rate of counting, the length of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> would fit to six. So it's about two-thirds. Then I can do a shorter <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, which would be three - so one, two, three; three, two, one. I could go to one, but we're not going to do that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > 1-9 during the inbreath 9-1 on the outbreath" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#1-9 during the inbreath 9-1 on the outbreath" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2
###### 1-3
So that's it. Let's do it. I'll explain why I'm offering it after we've done it, and say a few more things. Very simple. ^1-3
###### 1-4
(3:00, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditation</a></span> begins<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > guided meditation begins" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#guided meditation begins" class="internal-link">)</a></span> ^1-4
###### 1-5
So <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation posture</a></span>, we'll talk about that later, but it's upright, comfortable. It needs to be comfortable. Upright, relaxed, open. The posture should reflect the state of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, the state of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> - this balance between uprightness and alertness and energization on the one hand, and relaxation and openness and softness on the other hand. Somehow the posture, someone looking at you just gets a sense of that poise. Somehow that posture captures all of that. And then the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> has it as well. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="citta" class="internal-link">citta</a></span>_ has it. So find that posture. Establish yourself in that posture. Feel the posture. Feel, sense, how the posture reflects that poise I just talked about, between those sort of complementary qualities of the _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="citta" class="internal-link">citta</a></span>_, how the posture expresses that balance<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > The posture should reflect the state of attention" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#The posture should reflect the state of attention" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-5
###### 1-6
Just take a few moments to feel, while you're still feeling the whole posture, feel the connection, the sensations of contact with the cushion, the bench, the chair, with the feet or the legs on the floor. Then open it again to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>. I mean the whole space, a little bit bigger than your anatomical, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a></span>. You're sensitive to that whole space. Many times, your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> is going to shrink - countless times. You just keep opening it up to that whole space<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Feel the connection with the body and the energy body and keep opening up to it when it shrinks" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Feel the connection with the body and the energy body and keep opening up to it when it shrinks" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-6
###### 1-7
Now, this may be a little tricky, this first part. I want you to keep that whole-<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, and keep opening it up, keep returning to it, as many times as you need it (which will be many, many times). So you notice when it shrinks, and then you open it up. It might be a little awkward at first. You start to breathe. You do not need to move a lot of air. What's the longest comfortable <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> that you can take? It needs to be comfortable, and in fact, you _don't_ want to move a lot of air. We're not hyperventilating or anything. It's just very subtle, long, slow, smooth, and comfortable as possible. And see if you can kind of gauge what it would be to put a count to nine of that, and then a downwards count from nine to one on the out-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>. It takes a little while just to estimate, and kind of get a feel what's about the right length. Let it be comfortable. Find what's comfortable. Open up the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> to the whole space of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. Open up that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. Keep opening it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Gauge the longest comfortable breath" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Gauge the longest comfortable breath" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-7
###### 2-1
Take whatever time it takes to gauge the right length and the right sort of speed of counting, if you like. Whole-<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. Long, slow, comfortable <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>. The longest comfortable <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> that's possible. Not a lot of air. And with the counting, take your time to get the sense of the pacing of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> and the counting. Once you've found that, just stick with that. One to nine, nine to one, with this long, slow, comfortable, smooth, and actually relatively subtle <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Not a lot of air but long slow comfortable smooth relatively subtle" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Not a lot of air but long slow comfortable smooth relatively subtle" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
And what am I concentrating on here? You've actually got four things, potentially, that you're holding together in your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>. Potentially three or four objects: ^2-2
###### 2-3
**(1)** The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, this long in-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> or out-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, and the sense of that, the sense of where it is<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > 1 The breath" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#1 The breath" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4 
**(2)** You've got the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a></span>, the whole space of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, and what that feels like. You're holding that. You're sensitive to that as well as the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > 2 The whole energy body" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#2 The whole energy body" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 2-5
**(3)** If you have a visual imagination, you have a third thing that you're concentrating on, holding in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, and that's the visual sense of the numbers, the numerals, right there: 1, 2, 3. Bring some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>. See them, bright, bright like the sun. White, golden light. Bright, shining, with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > 3 The visual sense of the numbers" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#3 The visual sense of the numbers" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-5
###### 2-6
**(4)** And you might, as well, have a fourth, which is the aural, the inner hearing. You're hearing yourself say each number: one, two, three. So you have maybe three, maybe four objects here: the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span> space, how that feels; the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>; and either or both the visual sense, the imagination of the number, and the aural sense. Let yourself hear them, loud and clear - not shouting, but loud and clear. So four things your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> has to hold together, coordinate, and really open yourself to, give your <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to them<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > 4 The inner hearing" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#4 The inner hearing" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-6
###### 2-7
Don't worry if you don't have a visual imagination. Just go with the inner hearing. If you can do both, great. Keep stretching that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> - the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span> space, filled with alive, alert presence and sensitivity<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Dont worry if you dont have a visual imagination" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Don't worry if you don't have a visual imagination" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-7
###### 2-8
Let this long <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> open up the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of the body</a></span>. Meet every number. Be there. Sense it, alive. If you're drowsy, make those numbers brighter. Make them louder. Keep opening up the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> - the whole space, larger than the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. Keep opening it, again and again and again. To have to keep all of these three or four objects at once helps, gives the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> something to do. You can still play with giving an emphasis to one of them, or another one of them. But always you keep the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span> sense. Never lose that, even if it's in the background<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Meet every number" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Meet every number" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-8
###### 2-9
Then when you feel ready, let the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> become just a little shorter - still pretty long - to the count of six. So whatever the same pace of counting and breathing, it's a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> that's about two-thirds of that size, and you have a count of six in, and six back down on the out-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>. You've got all these objects: the whole space of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> in and out, perhaps the visual sense of the numbers, and the hearing internally of the numbers<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Breath a little shorter to 6" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Breath a little shorter to 6" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-9
###### 3-1
Perhaps you might begin to notice _when_ it is, in the cycle, that you tend to space out a little: "I always kind of miss the beginning," or "I'm not quite as present at the end of a cycle," or "when it turns around," or whatever it is. Just a little less bright, maybe. A little less alert, a little less there. See if you can notice where that is for you right now, and just apply a bit more intention there. Really show up then. Intend to show up. Make it alive there. Be really present<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > See if you can notice where to put a bit more intention" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#See if you can notice where to put a bit more intention" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
Keep opening up that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span> space, again and again and again. Fill it with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. Fill it with alive presence. Inhabit the whole of that space with sensitivity. Make the numbers, make each number loud and clear, and/or bright and clear to the inner eye<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Fill the whole body space with alive presence" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Fill the whole body space with alive presence" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
And then when you're ready, allowing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, supporting the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, shaping the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> to a shorter <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, to the count of three at the same pace. It's a relatively short <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>. Comfortable, smooth. Quite slow. Whole-<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. Whole space, filled with presence, alive, bright. Each number<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Shorter breath now to 3" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Shorter breath now to 3" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3
###### 3-4
Make it work for you. What do you need to do right now to make this work for you, make it come alive? What helps? If you want, for a few breaths, you can play with - if you've got a visual imagination - imagine the numbers behind you. Usually we construe things in front of us. What if they're behind us? Just play. Whole-<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Make it work for you" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Make it work for you" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-4
###### 3-5
When you're ready, coming back to the slightly longer <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> with the count of six. Comfortable, smooth. Opening the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>. Opening the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>. Holding this multiply-aspected object in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, engaging with it, open to it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Slightly longer breath to 6" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Slightly longer breath to 6" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-5
###### 3-6
And then, again, when you're ready, just returning shortly to the longest <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, with the count of nine. The longest comfortable <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, smooth, slow, long and comfortable. The numbers bright, loud, clear. Opening your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>.

###### 3-7
(29:20, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditation</a></span> ends] ^3-7
###### 3-8
And when you're ready, just letting your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> return to normal, whatever that is right now. Seeing if you can keep this whole-<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, and opening your eyes when you're ready<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Return the breath to normal keep the whole-body awareness and open the eyes" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Return the breath to normal keep the whole-body awareness and open the eyes" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-8
###### 3-9
How was that? Was that difficult, awkward? Yes? For everyone? Anyone find it helpful at all? Yeah? Some people? It may or may not be helpful to you. Beware of what I said earlier, about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>. Why do I even offer this one? A couple of reasons, which are worth going into. Most people, at the beginning of a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, you may feel like your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is a box of frogs, and you're very agitated or whatever. Most people actually suffer from low <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>. Their <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> might also be a box of frogs as well, but there's generally a pretty low <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, and the long <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> will energize. It energizes your <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> system, and it will open the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> that way and energize the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. Mostly, at the beginnings of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span>, that's often what's needed. Or a busy day, etc. - again, you might feel frazzled and agitated, but actually there's (maybe _as well_) a low <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Beware of inertia as most people suffer from low energy" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Beware of inertia as most people suffer from low energy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-9
###### 3-10
So the long <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> is really, really helpful in bringing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>. In this particular practice, it's tricky, because it takes a while to get used to it: "How do I actually find a count of nine to that? And how long? And that's too long, and it's uncomfortable, and then it's not smooth," etc. But it's a really powerful practice. Don't underestimate. That practice, what we just did, actually even just the first stage of it, just with the nine, could take you right up to the edge of the first _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_, potentially. So don't underestimate its power, if you want to play with it. If you don't, that's also fine. But bear in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> what I said about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > The long breath is helpful in bringing energy - it can take you right up to the edge of the first jhana" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#The long breath is helpful in bringing energy - it can take you right up to the edge of the first jhana" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-10
###### 4-1
If you _do_ want to play with it, you can do it any time. I mean, it can be a good start to the practice. It can be good at the beginning of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. But it could be something you're doing in three weeks' time, or three years' time or whatever - it's just part of your practice that you use, either a lot, or now and then. Really any time. If you find it helpful, it can be developed as something really quite helpful<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Can be done any time" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Can be done any time" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-1

Why? What's the advantage here? Maybe it's obvious to you. When we count within a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, it's like we're putting more pegs for the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>. There are more pegs for the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to grab hold of, right? In the same period of time, one in-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, let's say, there's not much there. It's very easy for the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> to get lost. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>'s given more to do here, and more to kind of really peg the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> in. And the pegs are clearer, and louder, potentially, and brighter, and all that's going to allow the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> to kind of coalesce more in an energized way. So it's there if you want. Some people, some portion of people, will find this extraordinarily helpful, if you bother to develop it, if you take the time to develop it. For other people, it's like, "Okay, whatever." But it's there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > It works because we are putting up more pegs for the attention" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#It works because we are putting up more pegs for the attention" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-2

Okay. Tomorrow, Kirsten and Sari will lead a session for anyone who wants any input, or advice, or feedback, or help around your posture. It's important for _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice that you're comfortable, that actually your <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> is comfortable. I spent the first - I don't know how many years of my meditative life really uncomfortable in my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, and it was only when Christina suggested to me, "Why don't you alternate postures, and sit cross-legged?" I had some soccer injuries, both knees. "Why don't you just sit sometimes on the floor, and sometimes ...?" And that's the point where my _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ took off. It actually allowed my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> to be comfortable enough. It's really important that the posture is supportive. So do come, get some input, ask in interviews, etc. And consider that, for some of you, it's a lot of stress on the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> to sit all day in one posture. If it's not, it's fine, but if it _is_, then consider alternating postures - maybe kneeling, and whatever it is<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > A supportive comfortable posture is important for samadhi" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#A supportive comfortable posture is important for samadhi" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-3

In _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice, we _are_ interested in working with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, so that _does_ have its place in _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice very much. It's very important. But we're going to do that later. You can't start with that. It doesn't work so well. First get comfortable. Let's get the thing going, and then we can introduce allowing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> to be there, and relating to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> within the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice. But that comes later<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > You cant start with working with pain" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#You can't start with working with pain" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-4

Good to move as well. You'll be doing a lot of sitting, a lot of slow walking and standing. It's good to move in the day. So if you've got a yoga practice, or qigong, or whatever, yeah, that can be really helpful, moving the energies, taking care of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, etc. I suppose - I don't know - maximum, like an hour a day, or something like that. But it can really be supportive, you know, if you're sitting a lot, and walking and standing a lot<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Good to move as well" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Good to move as well" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-5

Also, go for walks. In other words, go for a walk out there, off the grounds, with the idea of enjoying yourself, and opening the heart, taking in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>, appreciating, opening the senses, etc. So _do_ do that. The question of whether - we're still on movement now - you should go running or not, that's a sensitive one. It can vary from individual to individual, and the same individual at different times. Sometimes running, or that kind of more vigorous exercise, is exactly what we need for the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> to get a bit more circulated [when] it's getting very stagnant. Other times, running is actually just disturbing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>. This is part of the art and the responsiveness. You're going to have to feel and get a sense, "Is this going to help right now? I actually don't know. I'm going to try. I don't know." But it's there as a possibility. If it's something you do, it's something you want to pay <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to: how is that affected, etc., the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Go for walks" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Go for walks" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^4-6
###### 5-1
As I said, a lot of interviews on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. Tomorrow, or rather after tomorrow until near the end of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, we're going to be signing you up for interviews. So you look on the board, and you see, "My interview is at such-and-such a time, with this teacher, in this room." So you have to check, "When's my interview?" Yeah? Tomorrow, though, what we'll do is, if you feel like you want an interview - some of you have been here for a while; some of you may have things on your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, whatever it is - if you feel like you could benefit from an interview, please put your name on the sheet of blank paper marked "Who wants an interview tomorrow?" It's already up there. Please put your name, and one of us will see you tomorrow. We'll give you a time, etc. And I think, yeah, at some point we'll stop taking interviews tomorrow, and that will be it. But that will be some point in the afternoon. If you know _now_ that you're going to want an interview tomorrow, put it up now, because it helps us plan our times and rooms and things like that. So you may not want one; that's fine. Probably the next day, we'll tell you when to come, and then we might change that. We'll see how that goes. But there are going to be a lot of interviews<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Optional interviews" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Optional interviews" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1

And with the interviews, again, on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, please see it in the larger context. Usually on a _vipassanā_ (<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>) <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, bring _anything_ into an interview - anything about your life, or about whatever difficulty, or some situation, or relationship, or whatever it is, and we can talk about it. On a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, bring anything, and we look at it: "How can it become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>?", etc. On _this_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, what we mostly want to hear about is what's happening in your _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice. It's not that we're not interested in the rest of your life, but part of the supporting conditions, we're really kind of containing the content of the interviews. So that's what you bring: what's happening on the cushion? What's happening in the walking? What's happening in the way you're thinking about the practice? I mean, not 100 per cent, but generally speaking, we want to try and do that. And that, I think, will be really helpful<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > On this retreat different than for vipassa and soulmaking retreats we want you to focus in the interviews on the jhana practice" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#On this retreat different than for vipassa and soulmaking retreats we want you to focus in the interviews on the jhana practice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2

Okay. If you've got any business left over, things you need to take care of, calls you need to make, emails, if you need to write an email or whatever it is - hopefully not, but any business, if you can do that tonight, that would be great. It's going to be so helpful, way more than even for a usual <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, if you can just put unfinished business aside, and just really get into enjoying being here, relaxing and opening. So if you _can_ do that tonight or, at the latest, first thing tomorrow morning, really do that as a gift to yourself. Just have it done<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Put unfinished business aside as a gift to yourself" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Put unfinished business aside as a gift to yourself" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-3

Last thing: let me introduce, because of the complexities of my situation, and practicalities, and my needs, I've got three helpers on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. They won't necessarily all be here at the same time, but they'll be coming and going, and you will see them. Sometimes there might be situations where they need to sort of jump to the start of the lunch queue and stuff like that, so can we just - everyone see them, so we know who ...? Do you want to stand up, guys? Please. This is Laurence, and right at the back is Lea, and Nic. Okay? So you will see them coming in and out. They're going to sit with us when they're here, but they'll be coming and going a lot, and as I said, they might need to do stuff. So just so you know what's happening there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Helpers" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Helpers" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-4
###### 6-1
Last thing: slow down. But don't slow down _too_ much, meaning we're not doing that very slow <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahasi Sayadaw" data-href="Mahasi Sayadaw" class="internal-link">Mahāsi</a></span> thing, if you know that - lifting, moving, placing, etc. That's not the pace that's helpful for what we're doing, okay? Neither is too speedy. Eventually you can be either very slow, or very speedy, and it's fine within the context of a _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice. At the moment, we want a pretty slow, comfortable thing. Why? [silence] Okay, I'll tell you. [laughter] Because it's the pace, at first, at which you can move around and keep the whole-<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. Now, one way or another, whole-<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> is going to be part of this practice. It might be very secondary. It might be a background thing. But it might be a foreground thing. When you get to _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ - I'll talk about this more - it's all about whole-<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, anyway. But moving slowly around enables you to kind of keep that basic, whole-<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, that basic <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>. Too slow, and you get into the details too much, and you're just backing up the queue for whatever - people want to go to the toilet. But it's also a different practice. Too fast, it's actually hard at first. So that's why I'm saying "slow down." It's part of the whole kind of energetic <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> we want to gradually <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a></span>, this bubble of resource. So find that pace where actually that's what you're doing when you're moving around - you've got some sense of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>. That's the sort of pace<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > Slow down to retain whole-body awareness" data-href="Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#Slow down to retain whole-body awareness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-1

Okay. Long evening. Thank you for your patience. Sleep well, and have a good night's rest, and we'll see you - well, 6:45 to 7:30 here for the sitting, and then there's the posture session. There's the ritual with the phones. There are all kinds of things tomorrow. But see you tomorrow at some point, yeah? Okay. ^6-2
