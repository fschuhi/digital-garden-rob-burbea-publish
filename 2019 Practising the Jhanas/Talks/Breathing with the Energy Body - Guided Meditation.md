Now, this [[attention]] will shrink so many times you can't count in one session. Not a problem. You just notice that. You open it up again. You fill that space with bright presence, alive sensitivity.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And here, working directly with the [[energy body]], what we're interested in within that space is the texture of it, the vibration, the tone of it, the feel, the [[energy]] of it. It shrinks; you keep coming back to that.</span>

<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation > ^1-7" data-href="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation#^1-7" class="internal-link">1-7</a>**: _<a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> (4) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">When you feel ready, just allowing, supporting, encouraging the [[breath]] to be the longest possible comfortable [[breath]]. So really not a strain; just as long as is still comfortable - which may be much longer than you think, or that you're used to. And really not a lot of air. It's really quite a gentle, subtle [[breath]], relatively speaking. A long, slow, smooth [[breath]], in and out. And alive to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a> space, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">As we explored briefly yesterday, you can tune in, if you like, to the sense of the whole space, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a> expanding and contracting, and what that feels like throughout the whole space. And/or you could also pay [[attention]], tune into, feel into the sense of the whole space being energized, feeling energized with the in-[[breath]], and a kind of relaxation or [[letting go]] with the out-[[breath]]. Throughout the whole space, these are the energies, qualities, [[feelings]], tones, vibrations, if you like, that you're tuning into, opening to.</span>

##### ...
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation > ^1-9" data-href="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation#^1-9" class="internal-link">1-9</a>**: _<a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (3) · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> · <a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">And really let that long [[breath]] open up the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, open up the whole space. And again and again, opening up the [[attention]], the [[awareness]], to the whole space. Make sure your legs are breathing, are being breathed, your feet. You may not have anatomical <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a> of feet, or legs, or head, or whatever. That's fine. Just let that go, if they're not there, and you don't need to bring them back, or you may. But really the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a> is breathing. The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a> space is involved. Including the head, or where the head is, where the feet are, where the legs are - that region of the space, region of [[energy]], region of vibration.</span>

##### ...
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation > ^2-1" data-href="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> (4) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (3) · <a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a> (2) · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a> · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Okay. I'm going to do something a little bit different. We're going to take a little bit of a tour. So when you're ready, can you imagine the [[breath]] coming into the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, coming into the [[energy body]] space, at a point, let's say, a couple of inches to the side, or maybe a little bit below, as well, the navel, the belly button? It's probably not that helpful to imagine the [[breath]] as a kind of vapour like you see on a cold day when you breathe out, and the sort of water vapour and air, and that sort of swirling gas thing. Just what we're really interested in is, if I conceive of the [[breath]] coming in there, and just imagine that, how does it affect the whole [[energy]], the whole space, the whole tone of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a>? If you are visual, and you want to experiment with a visual thing, you could imagine the [[breath]] as a kind of column of light or beam of light coming in there, into the [[energy body]]. And how does it affect, how does it ripple out from there? What do you notice when you imagine that? Whole-<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> [[awareness]].</span>

---
##### ...
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation > ^2-2" data-href="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> (9) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (2) · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">But now, we don't have to be wedded to the longest [[breath]]. So there are two things to play with here: what do you notice when you imagine the [[breath]] coming in there? And also, what kind of [[breath]] does the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> want coming in there? Is it a really long [[breath]]? Is it a much shorter [[breath]]? Somewhere in between? Is it a kind of fuller [[breath]], or a very gentle, soothing [[breath]]? Don't be afraid to use your imagination to play. What do you notice in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a> space, and what kind of [[breath]] just feels best? All very light, very playful. What do you notice in the whole space - its [[energy]], its tones, its feeling? And what kind of [[breath]] feels best there?</span>

---
##### ...
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation > ^2-3" data-href="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> (2) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (2) · <a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">When you're ready, leaving that point there, and imagining the [[breath]] coming in at a similar point on the right-hand side. So about two inches from the navel - doesn't have to be exact at all; just somewhere around there that feels kind of, "It's okay." Maybe a little bit lower. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Whole body</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body awareness</a>, sensitive, bright. Sensitive to what the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> wants, what kind of [[breath]] it wants there.</span>

---
##### ...
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation > ^2-4" data-href="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation#^2-4" class="internal-link">2-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> (4) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (4) · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a> (4) · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So construing the [[breath]] and construing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> as just [[energy]]. Both are [[energy]]. Imagining, sensing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> and [[breath]] as [[energy]]. And feeling that, noticing what it feels like and what feels good, or as good as possible for right now. Whole-<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> [[awareness]]. Really opening up that [[attention]], again and again, to the whole space. And opening up the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a> to the [[breath]], to the [[breath]] [[energy]].</span>

##### ...
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation > ^2-5" data-href="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation#^2-5" class="internal-link">2-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (2) · <a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">When you're ready, the same thing, at a point, perhaps, in between. So on the midline of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, perhaps a couple of inches or so down from the belly button, from the navel, somewhere around there. Doesn't have to be exact; just what feels kind of right. Same playing, same experiment, same sensitivity and questions for the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a>, for the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a>. Opening, opening.</span>

##### ...
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation > ^2-6" data-href="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation#^2-6" class="internal-link">2-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> (3) · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">And again, when you're ready, moving that point, the point at which we're construing, imagining, sensing the [[breath]] [[energy]] coming into the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, moving it up that midline to somewhere in the solar plexus area. How does it feel? What do you notice in the whole space, with the in-[[breath]], with the out-[[breath]] construed, imagined, sensed there?</span>

---
##### ...
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation > ^2-7" data-href="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation#^2-7" class="internal-link">2-7</a>**: _<a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So there's really not a right and a wrong here. It might be you sense that whole space expanding, contracting, or energizing and relaxing. It might be that you notice certain currents through different parts of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>. They may be different, as you breathe in and out, at different points. Whatever it is that you find helpful to tune into, to feel into, to open to.</span>

##### ...
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation > ^3-1" data-href="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation#^3-1" class="internal-link">3-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">Centre</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">When you're ready, just moving up a bit higher on that midline to the heart [[centre]] - somewhere on the midline around the level of the heart, or a little higher even.</span>

---
##### ...
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation > ^3-2" data-href="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation#^3-2" class="internal-link">3-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> · <a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">If you're really into one of these points right now, you don't have to necessarily move on. We're just kind of doing a bit of a tour, if you want. You can stay with wherever you want to explore for a while, or what feels good. But if you want, you can move up now, and the [[breath]], imagine it, construe it, sense it coming in the front of the throat. So not down from the mouth, but directly into the throat. What ripples out, then, from that point, through the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a> space? Those ripples might even extend out of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, out of that space. Or they may circulate in the space. No right or wrong.</span>

<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation > ^3-3" data-href="1219 Breathing with the Energy Body - Guided Meditation#^3-3" class="internal-link">3-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> · <a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> (4) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (2) · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Again, if you want to, you can play with the idea, the [[image]], the sense of the [[breath]] coming in at the crown of the head, down into the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> space from there. So maybe your anatomy is clear. Maybe it's really not clear, or partially clear. It's not that important at this point. What happens, and what kind of [[breath]] does the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> want, when it comes in there, when it goes out there? How does it feel, the whole space? The [[breath]] goes out, but we're paying [[attention]] to the space, and how the [[breath]] going out feels or affects the whole space. Light, playful, open, sensitive.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And if you want, how about the [[breath]] [[energy]] coming in and out of the [[energy body]], of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a> space, either at the base of the neck, somewhere around there, or even up at the occiput, the base of the skull, or somewhere in between? Just find a region there, and just play. How does that [[breath]] coming in there affect the front of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>? How does it affect the legs, the whole space? What kind of [[breath]] feels good? What kind of [[breath]] supports a sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a> in that space, just as much as that is possible right now?</span>

<span class="paragraph">How about, if you're ready, somewhere around the back of the heart, the back of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, the [[breath]] [[energy]] coming in, going out there? Don't be afraid or concerned, "Am I imagining something?" If you imagine it first and then feel it, great. No problem. Imagining certain currents or whatever it is - it doesn't matter as long as the kinaesthetic sense gets involved, one way or another. There's that sensitivity to the feeling, the tone, the [[energy]], currents if there are, vibration, texture.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Then, again, if you want to, if you feel ready, how about the [[breath]] [[energy]] coming in either at the sacrum or the tailbone, or some place around there, again, along the midline? Perhaps there are currents flowing down your legs, as well as up the back, at the same time, radiating out from that point. What kind of [[breath]] supports a sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a>, a feeling of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a>, just as much as possible?</span>

<span class="paragraph">And when you're ready, coming out of the [[meditation]], opening the eyes. So you get the idea? Anything's possible here. There's no right or wrong. There's no order you need to go in if you're moving around like this. You might find you want to stay at one point for a whole sitting because that's the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Juiciness" data-href="Juiciness" class="internal-link">juicy</a> point, or that's the point where it's easiest for you. It could be anywhere, you know? Anything is possible. Experiment, yeah? You might have the [[breath]] coming up from the earth, through your feet, into the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a>. It might be from the middle of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, that it kind of expands out. It's not even coming in from the outside. Or it might come in from 360 degrees. There's no limit to what's possible here.</span>

<span class="paragraph">(inaudible question from yogi) Thank you, yeah. So the question is, if I'm recommending one base practice, what we've just done, is that one, or does one point within there become a base practice? Actually, in a way, we've done a couple already of [[energy body]] [[breath]] meditations, and I would conceive of _that_ as one base practice. That's why I said earlier today: why do I spend longer on the [[energy body]] practice? Because there are so many possibilities. So even within one sitting, you could do a tour like that, and then actually just go back to something like I'm just with the expansion/[[contraction]], you know? But basically, you've got [[energy body]], coupled with the [[breath]] - because we can also do it uncoupled from the [[breath]], but right now it's coupled with the [[breath]] - and within that, it's a huge playground, and that's your base practice.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Now, you might find, over time, that there's one spot that, within your base practice, within your springboard practice, it's your base point. You're just there a lot because it seems to work for you. But again, you still want to be responsive, creative, etc., and all that, and it might be that you still want to explore other things, if that's what you're doing. In other words, this [[energy body]] [[breath]] practice is quite a big territory, with a lot of possibilities, and actually infinite and endless kind of possibilities. Basically, we could say you're construing of the [[breath]] as [[energy]], and you're construing of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> as an [[energy body]], and you're just playing with how those two kind of - I don't know what the word is - dance, move in and out of each other. And anything goes. And what you're paying [[attention]] to is what feels good, what's helpful in terms of - remember the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s analogy of the soap ball, and the apprentice bathman, bathperson, just shaping it. That's kind of what you're doing. You're using the [[breath]] to shape that ball into what feels good. Does that make sense? Yeah? Okay. Derek, yeah?</span>

<span class="paragraph">(inaudible question from yogi) Yeah, okay. So Derek's saying sometimes you bring the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ in, or it comes in? You bring the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ in, and then you can't tell whether you're using one or the other? Do you mean that the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ seems to follow the rhythm of the [[breath]] once you've started doing the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice? Yeah. I'm not sure what to answer. In many respects, it's good to keep things separate, you know? But you may find that ... I think if you want to go deep in _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, you probably want to eventually separate it from the [[breath]], okay? Because you're going to get so deep that the [[breath]] actually stops. So you need to keep them separate. At the beginning, though, it might help - it's what I said earlier: it's like I'm just expecting to nail my [[attention]] to something, and it's going to take me into _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_. Actually the exact ingredient that's missing might be just something that juicens up the heart a little bit. And now that might be the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_. So you might be finding a particular key that works for you, but it's really got a larger context of, again, if you're a chef, you're just, "This needs a bit more" - whatever the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ would be, pepper or whatever. It just needs a bit more, and you're just adding. It's kind of like that. So that's my initial answer, but it's probably a little bit complicated. Does that sound okay? Yeah?</span>

<span class="paragraph">(inaudible response from yogi) Yeah. I think it's good - I will say more about this later on - it's really good to be clear: "I'm doing _this_. This is primary." If I use something else, and perfectly legitimate - I drag in an [[insight]] practice - it's secondary, and I'm doing it for what reason? Because something's got stuck, because something's blocked, because I just need something to loosen. "This is primary, this is secondary." When that thing's loosened, I can let go of it, and I come back to my primary thing. Yeah? So let's maybe say it like that for now. Okay?</span>

<span class="paragraph">Okay. Is that good? I'd like to talk. This is the third part.^[_transcriber's note: see the following dharma talk for part three_, [[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances]]]</span>
