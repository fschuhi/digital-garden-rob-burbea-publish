##### Vocabulary: jhanas are a subset of samadhi

<span class="paragraph">We're not too pushed for time, but I don't want to be too long. I want to talk about just an introduction to the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_ and a little bit of an overview. Again, what are we doing here? Why are we doing it? What are we talking about? What's the area we're talking about? So again, just to start with a bit of vocabulary, there's this word _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_, and I'll talk about that, of course. But there's also this word _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, which many of you will know. There's also the word _<a data-href="samatha" class="internal-link">samatha</a>. <a data-href="Samatha" class="internal-link">Samatha</a>_ tends to mean 'calm' or 'tranquillity.' _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a>_ is more of an umbrella term - at least that's how I use it, and I think that's how it was originally used in the texts. ==_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhānas</a>_ are a subset of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, if you like. And _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ - it's actually quite hard to define, but it's something like a state of harmonious <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a> of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> and body.== <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> are gathered, coherent, harmonious, in some state of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a>. Actually, even that's not _quite_ accurate: "Well, in the formless _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_, is there a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>?" Well, there _is_, kind of, and you can still have <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a> somewhere, but it's not really overtaking. So it's hard to get an exact definition. But I use it as a kind of umbrella state. There are lots of '<a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> states' we could talk about, for example, that are still states of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_. Because of the <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>, because of the <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a>, there's a kind of harmonization, a cohesion, a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a> of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> and <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Experience" data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">bodily experience</a> - all that [is] cohered, unified, harmonized in some sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a>. And there are lots of different flavours of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a>, as we'll talk about. That's what I mean by _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_.</span>

##### The Buddha talked more about the jhanas than about mindfulness

<span class="paragraph">The eight _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_ are a subset of that.

I'm going to read you, quite briefly, the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s description. He's talking to a bunch of monks:</span>

[This is the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> talking.] There is the case where a monk, quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskilful qualities [it's actually "withdrawn from _sensual <a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a>_, withdrawn from unskilful qualities," the Pali], enters and remains in the first _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_: <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">rapture</a> and <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> born from that withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation [accompanied by thought].

<span class="paragraph">In those days, they had bathhouses, and that's where you would go to have a bath and a wash. And there would be someone there who mixes soap powder with water to make your personal bar of soap for your bath, okay? And so this person, ==this bathman has this soap powder and water, and it's a skill to get it mixed right, so that it's not just a liquid mess, but it's got enough moisture in it that you can give it a good rubbing== and ... you understand? There's some skill in that.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And then the eighth _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ is called the 'sphere' or the 'realm' or the 'base' of 'neither <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a> nor non-<a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a>.'

##### Teaching the jhanas is contextual

<span class="paragraph">Teaching is contextual, I find. ==I would say different things, I _will_ say different things, dependent on who's in front of me, dependent on what my sense of what you need is, but also what your background is, and what you might have heard elsewhere.== So if we're talking about the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_, which we are, there will be things that, actually, I wouldn't even mention myself or emphasize, if it wasn't likely that you had already heard this or that elsewhere, or read this or that elsewhere, and therefore, you might be assuming that "This or that is true," or "This or that is the case," or that "It therefore follows that ... something else." And I might not think that whatever that is, or the assumption coming from that is helpful. So obviously, I'm going to be emphasizing, in this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, teaching from _my_ <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> of the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>,_ and my <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> _teaching_ the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_, and what seems to me, after many years of teaching the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_, what seems, _to me_, to be significant. What opens that treasure? What is the treasure here? What are the treasures here? What makes a liberating difference?</span>

<span class="paragraph">I'm going to contradict myself a lot, okay? I'm going to say one thing, and then I'm going to say something that sounds like it's a complete contradiction.

<span class="paragraph">I might say that some of us, some of you, maybe most of you, and ==maybe most people, really need to forget the whole question that goes on: "Do I have it now? Is this it? Am I in a _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, or am I out of a _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ ?" And focus, rather, on enjoying, on just really maximizing your enjoyment==, and getting the most <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a> in the moment, and developing what needs to develop to enable you to enjoy it more, and just drop that whole question: "Is this it?

<span class="paragraph">I can think of quite a few instances over the years where someone's come to me, and - I don't know how to say this - they've been exposed to _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ teachings elsewhere or whatever, and they come into an interview. Then they're describing their <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> or something, and they say, "So I think I broke through to the sixth _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ yesterday." And I say, "Oh, how was it?" And they say, "Yeah, it was nice." And ... [laughs] No! That's not ... that _can't_ be. It absolutely _can't_ be. Now, either they're faking a kind of Buddhist <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>: "I'm not supposed to be attached, so I'll just say it's nice, but secretly I'm like, 'Wow!'" But in this person's case, I genuinely think it just wasn't that big a deal. So that's not what we're talking about.</span>

##### Definitions do become important

<span class="paragraph">So actually, those definitions _do_ become quite important. We're really talking about something, "Yes!" It's really something else, you know? ==When there isn't the excitement, when there isn't that kind of "Wow," it's not going to make a difference to your life.== This person's describing something; it might have been a relatively new <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, but there was nothing in that <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, or having that, that was going to make much difference to her ability to let go, to her life, to her sense of existence, to her <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a> and world. It was just, "Oh, okay. That was the sixth _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_. Tick." Okay, I'm really interested in all this making a difference. So I might say that, "Look, it's important that we're talking about _this_ territory and not [that]." _And_ I might say, "Forget about all that, and don't worry about the definitions." I'm going to contradict myself a lot, and I reserve that right. [laughs]</span>

<span class="paragraph">I might also say, on the one hand, "Look, it's not about just focusing more intensely or nailing your <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, your <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a>, to something for hours, and then expecting something to happen. It's not about prioritizing the intensity or the <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> of focus." And I might also say, to the same person at a different time, or to another person: "More intensity, just more intensity to the focus. Energize that focus." Most people, I think, it's the first one: too hung up. I'll explain this as we go along, today and other days. It's too much thinking in the wrong way about what we're trying to do. We're prioritizing the wrong things. The priorities we're making may be not that helpful, not that fruitful.</span>

<span class="paragraph">==Why all this contradiction? Well, because the <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a> of all things is that we can look at them in different ways. That's partly what it means to say they're empty: you can look at it like that, and it's true; you can look at it like _that_, and it's true. And those can sometimes even be opposites. But partly also just because different people at different times, or the same person at different times - sometimes they need to hear _this_, and sometimes they need to hear _that_, regarding the same issue. And it might be opposite.== It's always the case with teaching. It's _always_ the case. That's partly why it's interesting teaching a group. In a Q & A, I might say something, yet someone sitting next to that person might need to hear exactly the opposite.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Yesterday I used this word 'mastery.' I just sort of threw it out there. It's a traditional word. I can't remember what the Pali means, but let me say what _I_ mean by it. I said we're aiming, or ==I would like us to aim, or to think about 'mastering' each _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_. What I mean by that is a few different components to that. I mean a really thorough familiarity with all the _jhānas_.== If we're talking about _any_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>, to say I mastered the second _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ or whatever, it means a really thorough familiarity and intimacy with all of its aspects. A _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>,_ actually, can manifest differently. It has different aspects, different flavours and tones within it. If I just dip in and dip out, I don't get to see: "Oh, sometimes it's like this, and it has that quality, and _that_ quality, and these different ranges of depths, etc." Different levels within each _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ - you can divide certain _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_ into different levels (and they're almost discrete as well), <a data-href="manifestations" class="internal-link">manifestations</a>, etc. I mean a thorough familiarity with all that. Also, by 'mastery,' ==I'm including in that meaning, really, a whole set of skills, a whole kind of artistry that's involved with regard to that _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>,_ in terms of working.== I mean also, thirdly, that one can enter it at will. Let's say it's the third _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ we're talking about. You don't need to go: "Number one, number two, number three," or "<a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a>, number one, number two, number three." You can actually just remember it. ==The cells and the _<a data-href="citta" class="internal-link">citta</a>_ just remember it, and you just have a subtle intention, and it comes back.== Or second _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, or whatever it is. I'm just intending for it to come up, and there it comes.</span>

##### With practice, intending a particular jhana doesn't need to be preceded by anything particular

<span class="paragraph">So with a lot of practice, that's what I mean by 'mastery.' That's included. You can go directly from nothing to any _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, just with a subtle intention. It doesn't need to be so much like, you know ... [snaps fingers twice] like that. It's probably more like a fader switch, more like a dimmer switch, yeah? But that's partly what I mean. It doesn't need to be preceded by its preceding _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_, doesn't need to be preceded by its base, whatever base practice, springboard practice of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ or <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> or whatever you're doing.</span>

##### Mastery includes staying in a particular jhana in any posture; "marinate" in it

<span class="paragraph">I also mean that you can access and sustain that _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ pretty much in any posture, and when you're going for a walk. It means you're doing a loop around _there_ for an hour in the lanes, and you can be doing that pretty much in the fourth _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, or whatever it is, if we're talking about mastery of the fourth _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_. I also mean that a _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ - this is part of mastery again - that you can really sustain it and remain in it. I'm going to come back to this. There's a word I want to use: 'marinate.' I'm going to come back to this. This is really, really important. ==We need to sit in a _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ a long time. It's doing a lot of work on the cells, on the being, on the _<a data-href="citta" class="internal-link">citta</a>_. It's fine to go through for two seconds on the way - that's all fine, but the real work happens when we really just get in and sit there for a long time, and really let that change our <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a>, our mental <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a>, and our energetic habits.== It's really _doing_ something different to <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, and that takes time, and it takes putting myself in it and staying there for a while.</span>

<span class="paragraph">'Mastery' also means navigating; I can move from that _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ to any of the other _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_ that I already know, and I don't have to go sequentially. Let's say I'm working on my mastery of the third, then I can go from the third to the first, or from the first to the third, or whatever. Yeah? Or the second. So that includes what I call 'leapfrog.' I can 'leapfrog.' Yeah? This is partly what I mean.</span>

<span class="paragraph">'Mastery' might also mean that I can modulate. So again, ==if we go back to this idea that a _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ isn't really one thing - it's a territory. It's a realm. And like a lot of realms, it has different (as I said) flavours, aspects, regions, levels. And I can modulate, move between those different levels, and actually, eventually, also bring in other qualities to mix with it, like mixing cocktails.== I can add a bit of this and a bit of that, and get an even nicer cocktail, or a different cocktail. In that process of learning to mature, it probably will be the case that what I originally thought was, say, the first _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a> -_ after I've gone through all that mastery process, by the time I finish, the first _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ actually feels quite a bit different, and I understand something different. As <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Thanissaro Bhikkhu" data-href="Thanissaro Bhikkhu" class="internal-link">Ajaan Geoff</a> used to say to me, "Stick Post-it labels on them at first." You know those sticky labels? They just come off. It's like, ==don't erect a whole sign that "That's _the first_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>." You say, "Okay, I think this is first _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, but let's just put a Post-it label now."== We'll go through this process, and they'll change over time as you work on them. They also change retrospectively. Once I get used to the third _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, the first _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ is transformed indirectly by my repeated <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> in the third _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, okay? We have to be a little bit easy, loose with the labels.</span>

Because that's the big picture: eventually I want mastery of all that, but ==we are where we are, and the way I'm going to get mastery is by playing in that playground that's on my edge.== That's what's going to give me mastery of that playground. ==And at a certain time, when I get that mastery, then the playground just shifts - either by itself, or I just have to a little bit shift it.

Let me go down there, and I'll eat some of that nice-looking grass." And because this cow is foolish and inexperienced and whatever else the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> calls it, the cow tries to do that, but actually is not very sure of its footing, even where it's standing, gets stuck in some ditch or something between the field, can't get to where it was planning to go - that other, nicer-looking pasture - can't get _back_ to where it was happily eating before, and is just stuck in this ditch. "Just so, monks," _da-da-da-da_. The idea is: wait until you master that place before moving on. That make sense? Very brief. Yeah?</span>

<span class="paragraph">Once you really get into all this, and if you will, if you have the patience and really what boils down to the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and the <a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a>, actually, if you have the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and the <a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a>, the <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a>, and you do develop this kind of mastery, then it really begins to feel like ==the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_ - they're almost like <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a> of being, if you like. They're beautiful, amazing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a> of being, treasures, treasure realms, enchanted realms.

##### That the realms already exists becomes obvious in the third jhana

<span class="paragraph">There's the tea bell. This is absolutely ridiculous. Should I just keep going? We'll check in and ...? All right. And now you get to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Juiciness" data-href="Juiciness" class="internal-link">juicy</a> bit. You want it, yeah? [laughter] They really feel like they're realms that are already there, as if they just kind of exist, like a realm exists. This begins to get obvious around the third _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_. It's much less obvious in the first or second _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_. But after a while in the third _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, you really feel this is like an enchanted, paradisical realm that is just sort of _there_, and I get the blessedness of being able to enter that, and hang out in that, and come out of that, etc. And ==it's only that we need to _find_ them. They're _there_. Or they're like radio stations, like frequencies.== I never listen to the radio, but you have these presets, right? You can put in Radio 1 or whatever it is, right? It's just like that. Or the old style, where you actually tune the ... thingy. Similarly, you might press the preset, and still it needs this fine-tuning. You know, the old ones used to have a big knob and a little knob that was the fine-tuner. Anyway, it doesn't matter; ==they're like radio stations. They're in the air anyway. So it begins to be, it's not like I'm huffing and puffing to make this _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ happen. It's like they're _there_. And what we're doing is tuning to something that's already there.== We can have this sense of them, is what I'm saying.</span>

And this is - again, it's my opinion, my emphasis - this is what's really going to make a difference. This is what's really going to be a treasure that affects the being, okay? So going too quickly through, we're not actually getting that treasure and the maximum value. Or it's a bit like a tourist going on holiday, and you go, and in your mobile phone, you take the photo of whatever it is, and then you send it on your Facebook to your friends, and they 'like,' and you 'like' what they sent you. And it's all like, "Okay, been there, done that." But it's not the same as really being there and living it.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So they're not achievement badges. We really want something so profound, such a profound treasure. ==We want it to work on the being. We have to linger. We have to live there. We have to, as I said, marinate, absorb - not just _get_ absorbed, but almost absorb the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ itself into our being, get to know it intimately, so that the cells, the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, the <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a> patterns of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, etc., and <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> are affected.

And they'd just whipped through all of them. But it won't be - and this is a while later now, and I can tell [for] this person, it hasn't become a profound resource. Okay, so they had a good time those ten days or whatever it was. Nothing has altered in their sense of existence. Nothing has altered from that _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice in their sense of existence, of self and world. Maybe they didn't _want_ anything to be altered in their sense of existence. Sometimes we get quite attached to our sense of how we think the world and <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> is. We're attached to a certain view, etc., philosophy, whatever it is. This person had a good time, but so what? So =='marinate' means a long time, and many times, in one _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_.

<span class="paragraph">So we're here. I'm teaching this. I'm giving a certain emphasis and a certain range.

So there's a way, organically, that one _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ will just ripen and mature into the next, just like what the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> described, and one has that sense as one's going through: =="Oh, wow.

<span class="paragraph">But also that there is - and here's that word again - responsiveness and intelligence. That's part of the deal too.

Why would I want something like that? It might _sound_ better - because it _sounds_ better, doesn't it? Is it? Can we bring intelligence and boldness to our questioning? Something _sounds_ better.

<span class="paragraph">And what I said yesterday about listening on your toes - do you remember that? Everything that I'm saying, this should set you recalibrating, rethinking, reorienting: "What does that mean? What do I ...?" You know, please don't just be passive about it.

Do I have a nose for it? Do I have a nose, an intuition, an intelligence? Can I develop a nose for it? Because sometimes, some of these arguments, it's like quibbling over what's insignificant, what's secondary. In the _Ānāpānasati <a data-href="Sutta" class="internal-link">Sutta</a>_, it says _parimukhaṃ_.

So they say, "Oh! Okay. Well, the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> means this is really the place to pay <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a>." And then people arguing about that - does it really matter? Is it really important? Does it make a difference? ==Does it make a difference if I keep the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> or my primary object? Some people say, "Absolutely. You can't let go of the primary object. If you're doing _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, you need to keep the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>.

<span class="paragraph">Some people say, "It's only a _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ if the senses close, if you can't hear anything." Well, the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> didn't say that. And does it matter? Again, it _sounds_ better. If I make the definition, "It's only a _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ when the senses close," that sounds like it's a better thing, right, than if they don't close? Would it? I mean, most people would say it sounds better. I don't know if it is. I think what I want to say is, can we bring a kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">discernment</a> and intelligence to these questions? Which are important, and which are not? What's important? What's secondary? What fruits will I get from pursuing questions that are actually not that important? Taste the fruit. Be nourished by the fruit, by the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Juiciness" data-href="Juiciness" class="internal-link">juicy</a> flesh of the fruit, and not worried about the pips and the pith of the apple, etc.</span>

##### For some teachers the emphasis is on changing the habit of papanca

<span class="paragraph">These questions are related to - what is our conception, and what is our emphasis, what's the main point of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice? And again, if you read certain things, or if you listen to different teachers, either explicitly or implicitly, you're going to hear various views from different teachers and different teachings about, what is the main point here of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice? For some people, some teachers might emphasize, we're really changing the <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a> of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a>_. You know what _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a>_ is? The mental <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">proliferation</a>. The primary thing you're doing, and the primary point of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice, is to change that <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a>, and actually eradicate that <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a> of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a>_. So the whole thing, really, the purpose is a movement to simplicity, to having or developing a <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> that's simple, that doesn't get complicated and embroiled in _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a>_. That's one view. Now, that might be explicitly stated, or just, you have to kind of listen a bit more to the totality of someone's teaching and hear, "Oh, that's their thrust. Okay."</span>

##### For some teachers it's about the power to disect phenomena

<span class="paragraph">Another person will say, "What's the point of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice?" And it's really that what you're doing is developing a kind of power in the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> that, like a laser beam, the <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> can dissect <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a>, because in dissecting them, that's what <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> is. I chop things. I see them really, really fine, down to the atomic details. And that's the point of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice, is to develop this laser-like <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a>.</span>

##### For some it's about unwavering focus, to reveal the nature of things
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas > ^10-5" data-href="1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas#^10-5" class="internal-link">10-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhanas</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> (2) · <a data-href="Nature" class="internal-link">Nature</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">And/or - there might be combinations here - someone might say, "No, what we're developing in _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ is the ability to sustain unwaveringly the focus on something, unwaveringly hold the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> or <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> on something." The assumption there is, as if automatically, holding the <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> on something will reveal the reality of that thing, will reveal the way things are. If I can just stare at this thing long enough, it will reveal the <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a> of it. It will reveal the way it really is.</span>

##### But staring at something doesn't disclose anything, it needs doing something with it
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas > ^11-1" data-href="1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas#^11-1" class="internal-link">11-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Nature" class="internal-link">Nature</a> (2) · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60869/20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-an_introduction_to_the_jhanas-60869.mp3#t=45:33" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Now, sometimes this isn't explicitly said. ==You have to kind of hang out with the whole totality of a person's teaching, or a certain drift of teaching, and see, "Oh, that's the assumption. That's how it fits in with the whole path."== Is that true? If I stare at an atom or, let's say, an electron long enough, just staring at it long enough will not reveal the <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a> of the electron. Or anything else - if I stare at an egg long enough. I have to _do_ stuff with something. And certainly in quantum physics, the electron - it's only when I start doing different things that I start to encounter what's most interesting about the true <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a> of the electron. And I start to realize, "Oh, it's actually dependent on how I look, and whether I look, and what I do, and what's around it." So it's not just staring at something. Again, why am I saying all this? Because so much, we arrive at situations like this with the idea: "It's really about, how long can I stay steady with my <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> on something?" I don't want to say that's unimportant, but I just want to shake up the sense of what we're doing and what's priority here, and what may be important, may be less.</span>

##### Once I have those treasures available to me it becomes much easier to let go
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas > ^11-2" data-href="1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas#^11-2" class="internal-link">11-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhanas</a> (2) · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a> · <a data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">Beauty</a> · <a data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">Pleasantness</a> · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> · <a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Another context might be, someone very rarely, stage by stage, you go through eight _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_, and then you go to the next stage, which is the <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> of the <a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a>. That's quite rare, but it's there. For me, I would say, as I said last night, ==there are resources that come with the practice of the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_, that really enable, really help us to let go. We say, "Let go, let go, let go, let go." Once I'm this rich in this <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a>, once I have these treasures available to me, it becomes much easier to let go.== I don't need the food to be nice. I don't need this or that. Who cares? I have so much, abundant - oh, my cup runneth over! - so much overflowing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a>, and delight, and pleasure, and <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>. I can let go of all kinds of things then. So that's one of the functions, this deep resource, as I would see it: I can let go of <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a> to things.</span>

##### Jhanas help to understand the process of fabrication of perception

<span class="paragraph">I also, secondly, begin to understand the whole process of <a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a> of <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a>, how the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> can <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricate</a> less and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricate</a> more. And in moving through the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_, I begin to understand that. That's also one of the reasons, one of the points.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And a third reason is ==the <a data-href="mystical opening" class="internal-link">mystical opening</a>, the kiss of the mystic. For me, that's a really important point and reason. I want my sense of existence, my sense of world, of self, of other, to open up.

<span class="paragraph">Okay. _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhānas</a>_ alone will not liberate one totally.

And I think probably, say, _most_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma teachers</a> would agree on that. There may be someone who disagrees, but I don't know. But definitely, most people agree on that. ==_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhānas</a>_ alone will not liberate totally.

We're a whole different species now than we were in the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s day.== Yes, of course, there's lots that's the same. The whole way we feel our self, the whole aspirations and what we consider normal in <a data-href="human relationship" class="internal-link">human relationship</a>, with ourselves and with others, and what we want from life - I'm not going to go into that, but there's a whole range of psychological work that, if we're talking about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">liberation</a> nowadays, for _us_, for you and me, needs to include all that. ==So yes, _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_; yes, <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>; and yes, psychological work; and _yes_, the <a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a> of virtues and the beautiful qualities - _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>,_ and <a data-href="generosity" class="internal-link">generosity</a>, and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, all those - those four together==, let's say.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So why the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>,_ and why the mastery? Because they're part of that mix.

I need a sharp tool, a laser beam. So then the idea I have of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice needs to go with that idea of what <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> is doing. I view my _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice as the development of this super-intense, super-hard sustained focus, and what I tend to emphasize then in the teaching of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_ is more intensity, more sharpness, more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a>, more focus.</span>

<span class="paragraph">If I think of <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> as _seeing clearly_, meaning seeing in more detail, then again, I tend to focus, I tend to think of the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_, and emphasize in the teaching of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_, something like that. Maybe I need to see in detail, for my <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>, the process of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a> in time.

And so my _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice needs to set me up so I can see, like a magnifying glass, and very fine, and I can see that - _if_ that's what I think <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> is, if that's what I think ultimate reality is. You see? We're working backwards here, and it makes an implication on what we think a _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ is, and then what we tend to emphasize within the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice.</span>

---
<span class="paragraph">Or again, as if I - I've said this before - if I can just _stare_ at something long enough, the reality, the truth of it will be seen, because I'm just staring at it plainly. If that's what I think, if I think 'plain staring' reveals reality, if that's what I think reality is, something that is revealed with 'plain staring at, plain looking at' ... yeah?</span>

<span class="paragraph">Or 'no thought' - we tend to think _that's_ the most important thing.

<span class="paragraph">Okay. I've finished, but we haven't talked about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">walking meditation</a> yet, have we? No. So, we'll need to expand this gradually. And again - I'm just going to be very brief now - it's because you're all in different places, with different histories. If you're familiar with <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">walking meditation</a> is with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body awareness</a>. Actually, if you're already familiar with _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, then you can start: here's one end of my <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">walking meditation</a> path. I'm standing. I stand as long as it takes to get, let's say, whatever it is, the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>_ or the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a>, the <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>. And I just hang out there. If it's nice, I'll hang out. I won't even walk, okay? I'm just standing, and I'm in that. Okay? That's quite an advanced stage already, if you can just get there. I'm just mentioning that. And then, if I do that, then I walk, and I'm concentrating in the whole <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> space on the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>_, on the pleasure. I don't care about my feet. I don't care about the sensations. I'm walking back and forth with the pleasure, and that's what I'm concentrating on - if you're there already; most of you won't be.</span>

##### I have to find the right pace that enables me to sustain the energy-body experience
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas > ^15-1" data-href="1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas#^15-1" class="internal-link">15-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a> (3) · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60869/20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-an_introduction_to_the_jhanas-60869.mp3#t=01:05:37" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">If you know <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a> already, same deal. Okay, I stand, feel my contact, etc., all that, and then open the space and just, what's the feel? What's the texture? ==What's the vibration of the <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a>? And then I walk back and forth with that. And I have to find the pace of the walking that enables me to sustain that and get into that experience.== Yeah? So it might be really fast. It might be really slow. It might be in between. It might change as I'm doing the practice, yeah? And if at any point I want to stop and stand and just get it back again, just stop and stand and get it back again. And I might spend five minutes at the end of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>. It doesn't matter. What helps me get that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body awareness</a>, and helps me get into it and in touch with it?</span>

##### Alternatively, walk with whole-body awareness
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas > ^15-2" data-href="1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas#^15-2" class="internal-link">15-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60869/20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-an_introduction_to_the_jhanas-60869.mp3#t=01:06:27" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">If you're still not quite sure what the <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a> is, then see if you can just walk up and down with a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole-body awareness</a>, okay? So just the sensations in the whole <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>. In other words, in terms of our choice, the least preferable is just the sensations in your feet, okay? It's fine, it's good, and if that's what you want to do or all you can do, that's great. But there's a kind of a movement here, with maturation.</span>

##### The rhythm of the practice is up to you, as long as it feels fruitful
<span class="counts"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas > ^15-3" data-href="1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas#^15-3" class="internal-link">15-3</a></span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60869/20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-an_introduction_to_the_jhanas-60869.mp3#t=01:06:58" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Okay, last thing. The rhythm in the day of formal practice, sit-walk-stand - we're going to say more about this, much more, later. But basically, again, it's up to you. What feels like it's helpful right now? So if you're sitting, and it feels good, and you feel into it, sit longer. You don't have to sit forty-five minutes. You could sit just as long as it feels like it's productive and fruitful, and you're having a good time. If then you begin to _not_ have such a good time, see if you can just work with it. ==Play your edges. See if you can expand it, okay? But basically, you're following what feels fruitful.== And if you're out walking, and you're just really into it, and it's going really well, just stay walking longer, or standing, or whatever, right? So there's a kind of rhythm that's individual and variable, and you're responsive to it, yeah? You have to be sensitive and responsive. Okay?</span>

##### In this kind of practice, the day needs to breathe
<span class="counts"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas > ^15-4" data-href="1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas#^15-4" class="internal-link">15-4</a></span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60869/20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-an_introduction_to_the_jhanas-60869.mp3#t=01:07:50" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And then there's this - you know, we talked about going for walks, and if you do yoga or qigong or whatever, also time to just chill out and have a cup of tea. The day needs to breathe. ==In this kind of practice, the day needs to breathe.== So sit, walk, sit, walk, sit, walk - may not be that helpful. It might be helpful for other practices. On this kind of practice, the day needs to breathe, and we need to be responsive. Different rhythms at different times - what's really working right now? What's supporting right now? If this is the first time you've not had a fixed schedule, then set yourself a fixed schedule, you know, if you're feeling at sea, and just go with that. But as time goes by, you'll begin to be more fluid, and it will be more responsive. Okay? Sorry so long.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Let's just sit for one minute together.</span>
<span class="paragraph">(silence)</span>
<span class="paragraph">Thank you, everyone. Enjoy tea. There's no need to rush, because it's only you guys or whoever it is doing the clearing up. So take whatever time you need, and the whole thing just rolls. We're on an open schedule, yeah? But the hall is open all the time, so enjoy tea. See you tomorrow.</span>
