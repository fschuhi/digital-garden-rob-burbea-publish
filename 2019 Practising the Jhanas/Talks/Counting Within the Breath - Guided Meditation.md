##### In the fist days we will offer a few different practices, today: counting with the breath
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^1-1" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^1-1" class="internal-link">1-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60863/20191217-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-counting_within_the_breath_guided_meditation-60863.mp3#t=00:37" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Okay. As I mentioned, we're going to be offering, in the first - I don't know - five days or so, quite a few different practices for you to try, or not. Like I said, if you already know Newton Abbot, it's fine. It's okay. But still, some of them can be really worthwhile. This one I want to offer tonight, it seems that it's not that well-known, so it might be quite new to most of you, maybe. It involves counting with the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>. Like I said, it may be <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> isn't even your thing, it turns out, but that's fine. We're just offering some things.</span>

##### 1-9 during the inbreath, 9-1 on the outbreath
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^1-2" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> (13)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60863/20191217-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-counting_within_the_breath_guided_meditation-60863.mp3#t=01:25" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Now, many people are familiar with counting. You count breaths up to ten, right? That's quite common. Or you just count indefinitely - 3,790 ... Or one counts up to ten, and then sometimes one counts before the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, or after the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, right? That's quite familiar? Yeah? What I want to do now is count _within_ the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>. For example, if I take a long <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, for the duration of that long <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, I can count: one, two, three, four, five, etc., down till nine. And then at nine, at the cusp of the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, at the turning point of the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, when that's the longest comfortable <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, the longest possible comfortable <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, then I turn it around: nine, eight, seven, six. And then if I do a slightly shorter <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, I can do a <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> that, at the same rate of counting, the length of <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> would fit to six. So it's about two-thirds. Then I can do a shorter <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, which would be three - so one, two, three; three, two, one. I could go to one, but we're not going to do that.</span>

---
<span class="paragraph">So that's it. Let's do it. I'll explain why I'm offering it after we've done it, and say a few more things. Very simple.</span>

##### guided meditation begins
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^1-4" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60863/20191217-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-counting_within_the_breath_guided_meditation-60863.mp3#t=03:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">(3:00, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditation</a> begins)</span>

---
##### The posture should reflect the state of attention
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^1-5" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^1-5" class="internal-link">1-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Citta" class="internal-link">Citta</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60863/20191217-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-counting_within_the_breath_guided_meditation-60863.mp3#t=03:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation posture</a>, we'll talk about that later, but it's upright, comfortable. It needs to be comfortable. Upright, relaxed, open. The posture should reflect the state of <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a>, the state of <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> - ==this balance between uprightness and alertness and energization on the one hand, and relaxation and openness and softness on the other hand. Somehow the posture, someone looking at you just gets a sense of that poise. Somehow that posture captures all of that. And then the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> has it as well.== The <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>, the _<a data-href="citta" class="internal-link">citta</a>_ has it. So find that posture. Establish yourself in that posture. Feel the posture. Feel, sense, how the posture reflects that poise I just talked about, between those sort of complementary qualities of the _<a data-href="citta" class="internal-link">citta</a>_, how the posture expresses that balance.</span>

---
##### Feel the connection with the body and the energy body and keep opening up to it when it shrinks
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^1-6" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^1-6" class="internal-link">1-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (2) · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60863/20191217-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-counting_within_the_breath_guided_meditation-60863.mp3#t=04:26" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Just take a few moments to feel, while you're still feeling the whole posture, feel the connection, the sensations of contact with the cushion, the bench, the chair, with the feet or the legs on the floor. Then open it again to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a>. I mean the whole space, a little bit bigger than your anatomical, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a>. You're sensitive to that whole space. Many times, your <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> is going to shrink - countless times. You just keep opening it up to that whole space.</span>

---
##### Gauge the longest comfortable breath
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^1-7" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^1-7" class="internal-link">1-7</a>**: _<a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (2) · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> (3) · <a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60863/20191217-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-counting_within_the_breath_guided_meditation-60863.mp3#t=05:18" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Now, this may be a little tricky, this first part. I want you to keep that whole-<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, and keep opening it up, keep returning to it, as many times as you need it (which will be many, many times). So you notice when it shrinks, and then you open it up. It might be a little awkward at first. You start to breathe. You do not need to move a lot of air. What's the longest comfortable <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> that you can take? It needs to be comfortable, and in fact, you _don't_ want to move a lot of air. We're not hyperventilating or anything. It's just very subtle, long, slow, smooth, and comfortable as possible. And see if you can kind of gauge what it would be to put a count to nine of that, and then a downwards count from nine to one on the out-<a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>. It takes a little while just to estimate, and kind of get a feel what's about the right length. Let it be comfortable. Find what's comfortable. Open up the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> to the whole space of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>. Open up that <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>. Keep opening it.</span>

---
##### Not a lot of air, but long, slow, comfortable, smooth, relatively subtle
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^2-1" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> · <a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> (4)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60863/20191217-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-counting_within_the_breath_guided_meditation-60863.mp3#t=06:50" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Take whatever time it takes to gauge the right length and the right sort of speed of counting, if you like. Whole-<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>. Long, slow, comfortable <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>. The longest comfortable <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> that's possible. Not a lot of air. And with the counting, take your time to get the sense of the pacing of the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> and the counting. Once you've found that, just stick with that. One to nine, nine to one, with this long, slow, comfortable, smooth, and actually relatively subtle <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>.</span>

##### Four things to hold together in your attention
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^2-2" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">And what am I concentrating on here? You've actually got four things, potentially, that you're holding together in your <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a>. Potentially three or four objects:</span>

---
##### (1) The breath
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^2-3" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> (3)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60863/20191217-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-counting_within_the_breath_guided_meditation-60863.mp3#t=08:16" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(1)** The <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, this long in-<a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> or out-<a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, and the sense of that, the sense of where it is.</span>

---
##### (2) The whole energy body
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^2-4" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^2-4" class="internal-link">2-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60863/20191217-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-counting_within_the_breath_guided_meditation-60863.mp3#t=08:25" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(2)** You've got the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a>, the whole space of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, and what that feels like. You're holding that. You're sensitive to that as well as the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>.</span>

---
##### (3) The visual sense of the numbers
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^2-5" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^2-5" class="internal-link">2-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a> · <a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60863/20191217-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-counting_within_the_breath_guided_meditation-60863.mp3#t=08:39" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(3)** If you have a visual imagination, you have a third thing that you're concentrating on, holding in <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, and that's the visual sense of the numbers, the numerals, right there: 1, 2, 3. ==Bring some <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>. See them, bright, bright like the sun. White, golden light. Bright, shining, with the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, with the whole body.==</span>

---
##### (4) The inner hearing
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^2-6" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^2-6" class="internal-link">2-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60863/20191217-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-counting_within_the_breath_guided_meditation-60863.mp3#t=09:18" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(4)** And you might, as well, have a fourth, which is the aural, the inner hearing. You're hearing yourself say each number: one, two, three. So you have maybe three, maybe four objects here: the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a> space, how that feels; the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>; and either or both the visual sense, the imagination of the number, and the aural sense. Let yourself hear them, loud and clear - not shouting, but loud and clear. ==So four things your <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> has to hold together, coordinate, and really open yourself to, give your <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to them.==</span>

---
##### Don't worry if you don't have a visual imagination
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^2-7" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^2-7" class="internal-link">2-7</a>**: _<a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Don't worry if you don't have a visual imagination. Just go with the inner hearing. If you can do both, great. ==Keep stretching that <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> - the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a> space, filled with alive, alert presence and sensitivity.==</span>

---
##### Meet every number
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^2-8" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^2-8" class="internal-link">2-8</a>**: _<a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (3) · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Let this long <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> open up the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of the body</a>. ==Meet every number. Be there. Sense it, alive. If you're drowsy, make those numbers brighter. Make them louder. Keep opening up the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> - the whole space, larger than the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>. Keep opening it, again and again and again.== To have to keep all of these three or four objects at once helps, gives the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> something to do. You can still play with giving an emphasis to one of them, or another one of them. ==But always you keep the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a> sense. Never lose that, even if it's in the background.==</span>

---
##### Breath a little shorter, to 6
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^2-9" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^2-9" class="internal-link">2-9</a>**: _<a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> (4) · <a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Then when you feel ready, let the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> become just a little shorter - still pretty long - to the count of six. So whatever the same pace of counting and breathing, it's a <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> that's about two-thirds of that size, and you have a count of six in, and six back down on the out-<a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>. You've got all these objects: the whole space of the <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a>, the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> in and out, perhaps the visual sense of the numbers, and the hearing internally of the numbers.</span>

##### See if you can notice where to put a bit more intention
<span class="counts"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^3-1" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^3-1" class="internal-link">3-1</a></span>

<span class="paragraph">Perhaps you might begin to notice _when_ it is, in the cycle, that you tend to space out a little: "I always kind of miss the beginning," or "I'm not quite as present at the end of a cycle," or "when it turns around," or whatever it is. Just a little less bright, maybe. A little less alert, a little less there. ==See if you can notice where that is for you right now, and just apply a bit more intention there. Really show up then. Intend to show up. Make it alive there. Be really present.==</span>

<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60863/20191217-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-counting_within_the_breath_guided_meditation-60863.mp3#t=29:59" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">How was that? Was that difficult, awkward? Yes? For everyone? Anyone find it helpful at all? Yeah? Some people? It may or may not be helpful to you. Beware of what I said earlier, about <a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a>. Why do I even offer this one? A couple of reasons, which are worth going into. Most people, at the beginning of a <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, you may feel like your <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is a box of frogs, and you're very agitated or whatever. Most people actually suffer from low <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>. Their <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> might also be a box of frogs as well, but there's generally a pretty low <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>, and the long <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> will energize. It energizes your <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> system, and it will open the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> that way and energize the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>. Mostly, at the beginnings of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a>, that's often what's needed. Or a busy day, etc. - again, you might feel frazzled and agitated, but actually there's (maybe _as well_) a low <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>.</span>

##### The long breath is helpful in bringing energy - it can take you right up to the edge of the first jhana
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^3-10" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^3-10" class="internal-link">3-10</a>**: _<a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a> · <a data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhanas</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Inertia" class="internal-link">Inertia</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60863/20191217-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-counting_within_the_breath_guided_meditation-60863.mp3#t=31:22" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So the long <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> is really, really helpful in bringing <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>. In this particular practice, it's tricky, because it takes a while to get used to it: "How do I actually find a count of nine to that? And how long? And that's too long, and it's uncomfortable, and then it's not smooth," etc. But it's a really powerful practice. Don't underestimate. That practice, what we just did, actually even just the first stage of it, just with the nine, could take you right up to the edge of the first _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, potentially. So don't underestimate its power, if you want to play with it. If you don't, that's also fine. But bear in <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> what I said about <a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">If you _do_ want to play with it, you can do it any time. I mean, it can be a good start to the practice. It can be good at the beginning of the <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>. But it could be something you're doing in three weeks' time, or three years' time or whatever - it's just part of your practice that you use, either a lot, or now and then. Really any time. If you find it helpful, it can be developed as something really quite helpful.</span>

##### It works because we are putting up more pegs for the attention
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^4-2" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^4-2" class="internal-link">4-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> (2) · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> (3) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2) · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Why? What's the advantage here? Maybe it's obvious to you. When we count within a <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, it's like we're putting more pegs for the <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a>. There are more pegs for the <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to grab hold of, right? In the same period of time, one in-<a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, let's say, there's not much there. It's very easy for the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> to get lost. The <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>'s given more to do here, and more to kind of really peg the <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> in. And the pegs are clearer, and louder, potentially, and brighter, and all that's going to allow the <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> to kind of coalesce more in an energized way. So it's there if you want. Some people, some portion of people, will find this extraordinarily helpful, if you bother to develop it, if you take the time to develop it. For other people, it's like, "Okay, whatever." But it's there.</span>

##### A supportive, comfortable posture is important for samadhi
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^4-3" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^4-3" class="internal-link">4-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhanas</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (4) · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Okay. Tomorrow, Kirsten and Sari will lead a session for anyone who wants any input, or advice, or feedback, or help around your posture. It's important for _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice that you're comfortable, that actually your <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> is comfortable. I spent the first - I don't know how many years of my meditative life really uncomfortable in my <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, and it was only when Christina suggested to me, "Why don't you alternate postures, and sit cross-legged?" I had some soccer injuries, both knees. "Why don't you just sit sometimes on the floor, and sometimes ...?" And that's the point where my _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ took off. It actually allowed my <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> to be comfortable enough. It's really important that the posture is supportive. So do come, get some input, ask in interviews, etc. And consider that, for some of you, it's a lot of stress on the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> to sit all day in one posture. If it's not, it's fine, but if it _is_, then consider alternating postures - maybe kneeling, and whatever it is.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Good to move as well. You'll be doing a lot of sitting, a lot of slow walking and standing. It's good to move in the day.

<span class="paragraph">Also, go for walks. In other words, ==go for a walk out there, off the grounds, with the idea of enjoying yourself, and opening the heart, taking in the <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a>, appreciating, opening the senses, etc.== So _do_ do that. The question of whether - we're still on movement now - you should go running or not, that's a sensitive one. It can vary from individual to individual, and the same individual at different times. Sometimes running, or that kind of more vigorous exercise, is exactly what we need for the <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> to get a bit more circulated [when] it's getting very stagnant. Other times, running is actually just disturbing the <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>. This is part of the art and the responsiveness. You're going to have to feel and get a sense, "Is this going to help right now? I actually don't know. I'm going to try. I don't know." But it's there as a possibility. If it's something you do, it's something you want to pay <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to: how is that affected, etc., the <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>?</span>

Tomorrow, or rather after tomorrow until near the end of the <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, we're going to be signing you up for interviews. So you look on the board, and you see, "My interview is at such-and-such a time, with this teacher, in this room." So you have to check, "When's my interview?" Yeah? Tomorrow, though, what we'll do is, if you feel like you want an interview - some of you have been here for a while; some of you may have things on your <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, whatever it is - if you feel like you could benefit from an interview, please put your name on the sheet of blank paper marked "Who wants an interview tomorrow?" It's already up there. Please put your name, and one of us will see you tomorrow. We'll give you a time, etc. And I think, yeah, at some point we'll stop taking interviews tomorrow, and that will be it. But that will be some point in the afternoon. If you know _now_ that you're going to want an interview tomorrow, put it up now, because it helps us plan our times and rooms and things like that. So you may not want one; that's fine. Probably the next day, we'll tell you when to come, and then we might change that. We'll see how that goes. But there are going to be a lot of interviews.</span>

On a <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a> <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, bring anything, and we look at it: "How can it become <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a>?", etc. On _this_ <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, what we mostly want to hear about is what's happening in your _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice. ==It's not that we're not interested in the rest of your life, but part of the supporting conditions, we're really kind of containing the content of the interviews. So that's what you bring: what's happening on the cushion? What's happening in the walking? What's happening in the way you're thinking about the practice?== I mean, not 100 per cent, but generally speaking, we want to try and do that. And that, I think, will be really helpful.</span>

##### Put unfinished business aside, as a gift to yourself

<span class="paragraph">Okay. If you've got any business left over, things you need to take care of, calls you need to make, emails, if you need to write an email or whatever it is - hopefully not, but any business, if you can do that tonight, that would be great. It's going to be so helpful, way more than even for a usual <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, if you can just put unfinished business aside, and just really get into enjoying being here, relaxing and opening. So if you _can_ do that tonight or, at the latest, first thing tomorrow morning, really do that as a gift to yourself. Just have it done.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Last thing: let me introduce, because of the complexities of my situation, and practicalities, and my needs, I've got three helpers on this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>. They won't necessarily all be here at the same time, but they'll be coming and going, and you will see them. Sometimes there might be situations where they need to sort of jump to the start of the lunch queue and stuff like that, so can we just - everyone see them, so we know who ...? Do you want to stand up, guys? Please. This is Laurence, and right at the back is Lea, and Nic. Okay? So you will see them coming in and out. They're going to sit with us when they're here, but they'll be coming and going a lot, and as I said, they might need to do stuff. So just so you know what's happening there.</span>

##### Slow down, to retain whole-body awareness
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation > ^6-1" data-href="1217 Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#^6-1" class="internal-link">6-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Mahasi Sayadaw" class="internal-link">Mahasi Sayadaw</a> · <a data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhanas</a> (2) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (6) · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> (5) · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Last thing: slow down. But don't slow down _too_ much, meaning we're not doing that very slow <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahasi Sayadaw" data-href="Mahasi Sayadaw" class="internal-link">Mahāsi</a> thing, if you know that - lifting, moving, placing, etc. That's not the pace that's helpful for what we're doing, okay? Neither is too speedy. Eventually you can be either very slow, or very speedy, and it's fine within the context of a _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice. At the moment, we want a pretty slow, comfortable thing. Why? [silence] Okay, I'll tell you. [laughter] Because it's the pace, at first, at which you can move around and keep the whole-<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>. Now, one way or another, whole-<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> is going to be part of this practice. It might be very secondary. It might be a background thing. But it might be a foreground thing. When you get to _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ - I'll talk about this more - it's all about whole-<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, anyway. But ==moving slowly around enables you to kind of keep that basic, whole-<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, that basic mindfulness.== Too slow, and you get into the details too much, and you're just backing up the queue for whatever - people want to go to the toilet. But it's also a different practice. Too fast, it's actually hard at first. So that's why I'm saying "slow down." ==It's part of the whole kind of energetic <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> we want to gradually <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a>, this bubble of resource. So find that pace where actually that's what you're doing when you're moving around - you've got some sense of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a>, and the <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> of the whole body.== That's the sort of pace.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Okay. Long evening. Thank you for your patience. Sleep well, and have a good night's rest, and we'll see you - well, 6:45 to 7:30 here for the sitting, and then there's the posture session. There's the ritual with the phones. There are all kinds of things tomorrow. But see you tomorrow at some point, yeah? Okay.</span>
