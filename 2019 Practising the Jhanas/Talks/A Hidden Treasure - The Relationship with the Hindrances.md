[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances -|plain list]]

##### You're all in different places with different needs
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^1-1" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^1-1" class="internal-link">1-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=00:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Actually, what I want to do is talk about the [[hindrances]], but a couple of things before that. As I said, it's difficult teaching this [[retreat]]. There's so much I want to communicate, and so much that feels important to communicate, because you're all in different places with different needs. I mentioned the walking practice yesterday, and Derek's just mentioned _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_.</span>

##### Metta with the energy body awareness, while walking
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^1-2" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (7) · <a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a> · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=00:27" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Who is doing _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ as their basic practice? Anyone? Great, okay. When you walk, are you comfortable walking with the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice? Like, you know how to do that? Yeah? Okay. What I want to say, I guess, is I will talk about _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ tomorrow, but again, what I want to introduce is doing _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body awareness</a>, which means that I might have phrases, I might have visualizations or whatever, but I've actually got this whole space, and I never lose that, and I'm sensitive to that (I'll talk more about this tomorrow), so that when I walk up and down, I'm walking up and down in that kind of [[awareness]], with all the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ and however I'm doing the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, yeah? Actually, that's all I want to say for now, and I'll talk about _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ tomorrow. Is that okay?</span>

##### I want to _add_ reasons why doing jhana practice, not get rid of others
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^1-3" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhanas</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=01:19" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Second thing, very briefly, I was very rushed in the latter part of yesterday's talk, so I just want to make sure that something was clear. It might have been clear anyway, and I might not need to say this. But when I was talking about, you know, "Why are we doing _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice?", and how we conceive of the reasons for doing _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice, and therefore what we emphasize, I don't want to replace other emphases or what other teachers might emphasize - simplifying, or laser beam, or unwavering [[mind]], or all that. I don't want to replace those reasons - more _add_ to them, okay? So all those emphases are important, can get emphasized at different times, but I just want very much to add something that's not often talked about, that to me seems really, really important: these qualities of sensitivity, attunement, refinement, etc. It's more to add that to the possible reasons we're doing this, and the possible emphases, and actually, then, to allow those to be more prominent, or even the _most_ prominent emphases and reasons. So I didn't mean to say, you know, we're getting rid of all that. It's more just a question of emphasis.</span>

##### "With the abandoning of the hindrances, there arises the first jhana"
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^1-4" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> (6) · <a data-href="Sutta" class="internal-link">Sutta</a> · <a data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhanas</a> (5) · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=02:47" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Okay, what I want to talk about, as I said, is the [[hindrances]]. Now, there are a few things here: one is that sometimes, in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sutta" data-href="Sutta" class="internal-link">suttas</a>, it's almost - not quite a definition, but it's almost like, with the abandoning of the [[hindrances]], there arises the first _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_. So it's almost like part of the definition of the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ is the absence of the [[hindrances]]. It doesn't say, "With the unwavering <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a> on this or that." It says, "With the abandoning of the [[hindrances]]."^[E.g. DN 2] That's quite interesting, and it's quite important. Again, it has implications. How am I thinking about what I'm doing here? But part of what I want to say about them is, it could sound like, "Okay, so working with the [[hindrances]] is something that applies pre-<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>. And it certainly does, of course; it applies right from day one of anyone's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation practice</a>. But not _just_ then. ==Once the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>,_ and even all eight _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>,_ are maybe accessible and regular visitors or explorations, etc. - even once all that is kind of up and running and going and wonderful, the [[hindrances]] will still arise at times.== Absolutely.</span>

---
##### Even within a jhana, there can be subtle hindrances around
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^2-1" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhanas</a> (7) · <a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> (4) · <a data-href="Sutta" class="internal-link">Sutta</a> · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=04:13" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">What I also want to add, and what's much less commonly talked about and acknowledged, is that they can arise very subtly, subtle versions of them can arise _in_ a _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ as well. Now I use that word _in,_ in a loose way, kind of avoiding the silliness of this extra-sharp definition of what is and what isn't a _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_. The point is, again, about subtlety, that even within a _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, there can be subtle [[hindrances]] around. And there's a [[sutta]] in the _Majjhima Nikāya_ where the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s teaching, actually, super, super-advanced meditators. They're doing all this whizzy stuff with psychic powers and all that stuff, and he's still talking to them about what subtle [[hindrances]] arise in that depth of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_.^[MN 128] So we have to have this idea of the [[hindrances]], as I said earlier - they're part of the deal. They're part of the deal when, certainly, _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ feels like a million miles away. They're part of the deal once we've already had a lot of [[experience]] in the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_. They'll be coming and going. And they're actually part of the deal in a subtle way even _in_ a _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, therefore part of the work, part of the play, part of the whole. Again, when I say '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a> _practice,' I_ mean_ _including the [[hindrances]] and all that.</span>

---
##### In jhana practice, we want antidotes to work against the hindrances
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^2-2" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> (6) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhanas</a> · <a data-href="Satipatthana Sutta" class="internal-link">Satipatthana Sutta</a> · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=05:31" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">I want to say something about [[insight]] in relation to the [[hindrances]], but first thing I want to do is rattle through pretty quickly, because a lot of this is probably familiar to you. I want to rattle through some antidotes to the [[hindrances]]. First thing to say before that is, an 'antidote' is something we - you know, you apply something with a certain goal in [[mind]]: I want to get rid of something. I want an antidote to an illness, or whatever: let's hope to get rid of this illness. So there's, let's say, ways of practising <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a> at times, when a hindrance comes up, and the view is, "It's fine. It's just here. I just watch it. I do the same with a hindrance as I do with a non-hindrance or anything else. I'm just watching it. It's not better or worse. And I'm just - it's okay." When you're doing _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice, that's not the attitude. We want antidotes, and we want to work against the [[hindrances]]. And this is primarily, even in the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Satipatthana Sutta" data-href="Satipatthana Sutta" class="internal-link">Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta</a>_ - this is actually the instruction of the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> - he's talking about what feeds the [[hindrances]] and what starves the [[hindrances]].^[DN 22, MN 10. Also see SN 46:51] And we're clearly really interested in what starves the [[hindrances]].</span>

---
##### Watch out for the habit of letting-be in standard mindfulness practice
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^2-3" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhanas</a> · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Inertia" class="internal-link">Inertia</a> (2) · <a data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">Habit</a> (2) · <a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=06:51" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">There's a slight kind of tilting, over the years of modern [[mindfulness]] teaching - but anyway. It's still a valid way of working at times, but in _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, in _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ practice, no. We've got a different relationship, a different attitude. Again, watch out for the [[inertia]]. Watch out for the [[habit]]. If you have a [[habit]] of just, "Oh, it's just a hindrance. I'll just sit it out. I'll just watch it. It's okay. It's fine," we want to shake up that [[inertia]] a little bit, galvanize it. They're going to come. There's no way they're not going to come. ==If you come into an interview and you report to me that you just didn't have any [[hindrances]], I'd just say you're not paying attention.== Because at _least_ the subtle ones are going to come, no matter how much practice you've done, and usually, as I'll explain later, also the not-so-subtle ones.</span>

---
<span class="paragraph">So, rattling off through the antidotes, the two most common [[hindrances]] are probably - they're given usually in a certain order, but let's start with the two most common, which are sloth and torpor, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a> and worry. I'm just going to throw out a bunch, and if you think of one that I've forgotten that's actually really helpful, then just shout it out. We'll put them all in a pot for everyone to use.</span>

---
### (1) Sloth and torpor
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^2-5" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^2-5" class="internal-link">2-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=08:11" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(1) Sloth and torpor**: getting sleepy is the extreme, the head nodding like that. But like all of these, it has a range, so just dullness, fogginess, sleepiness, etc., lack of [[energy]].</span>

---
##### (a) Expanding the awareness to the whole body
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^2-6" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^2-6" class="internal-link">2-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> (3) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=08:23" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(a) Expanding the [[awareness]] to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a>**. There's a reason why I say that over and over and over. It's so, so, so important. It will affect the [[mind]]. It's impossible - if you're really expanding the [[awareness]] and really filling it with [[attention]], it's actually quite hard to be nodding. There's something about it that's the opposite movement. So expanding the [[awareness]] to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a> and really filling it, again and again and again.</span>

##### (b) A bit more attention to the naturally energizing in-breath
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^3-1" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^3-1" class="internal-link">3-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> (4) · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=08:53" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(b)** As I've mentioned as part of a couple of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditations</a>, the in-[[breath]] is naturally energizing.

You can think of it as oxygen or whatever, but if you think in [[energy]] terms, it's just there's more [[energy]] there. And that will energize the [[mind]].

<span class="paragraph">**(g) More pegs**, okay? We talked about pegs in the counting, right? Bringing back those pegs really gives the [[mind]] - keeps it busy, gives it something to focus on. It literally keeps it up from sagging, okay? **With the numbers and the counting, they're like pegs. With the** _**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>**_ **practice, if you're using phrases, the phrases are like pegs.** _What can often be really helpful in the_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ _practice - so let's say your first two phrases are "May you be happy" and "May you be peaceful." So usually you go, "May you be happy. May you be peaceful." Actually, if the [[mind]] needs a bit more pegs, if it needs more [[energy]], or if it's getting lost: "May you be happy. May you be happy. May you be peaceful. May you be peaceful." Say each one twice. First one, I'm not quite there. The second one, I'm a bit more there.

<span class="paragraph">When you go wide like that, and you come into a mode of completely allowing, completely welcoming, we're almost, by definition, quietening the [[aversion]].

Actually, if you just do [that] - I remember playing with this years ago in the Hermitage, sitting - restless, restless, sitting while doing that - actually then ending up sitting for three hours, because that very practice just allowed everything to calm really, really, really down. So all these things - they're quite powerful, if we find the right way to work with them.</span>

So oftentimes, what happens is there's sexual [[desire]], and it goes to an [[image]] of having sexual contact in some kind of way - I have this person, or whatever it is. That's the bit that's not so helpful for _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>._ But the [[desire]] itself and the [[energy]], there's a way of working with it.</span>

<span class="paragraph">For instance: okay, here's [[desire]]. It's gone to the [[image]] already. Is it possible to kind of feel the [[energy]] of sexual arousal? So I've got [[desire]], I've got [[image]] (in the probably _not_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal sense</a>, but an [[image]] there), and I've got sexual [[energy]] or arousal. Of course, they're related. We could say you've got three things. Of those three, if I can focus on and open to, actually, and feel the _[[energy]]_ - so most people, the [[desire]] comes up, and then the [[image]] comes up, and then the feeling, and I'm lost in the [[image]]. I'm lost in chasing this sexual [[fantasy]]. I'm embroiled in it. If I just can kind of **focus more on the _[[energy]]_ and actually _open_ to it, _allow_ that actual [[energy]] in the space of the [[energy body]]**, actually, it feels good. If it's not too tight, I open to it, and I enjoy it, it's actually quite close to _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>_. It's quite close to the kind of good feeling. And oftentimes when people first [[experience]] _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>_, they say, "Oh, it's like an orgasm." It doesn't have to be that intense, but there's a similarity there.</span>

##### Shaping the arousal into something that's more pure energy
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^5-3" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^5-3" class="internal-link">5-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a> · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a> · <a data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">Piti</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So what you're really doing is approaching this thing more energetically, feeling it, opening to it, and kind of riding it in a way that allows it to shape into something that's a more pure [[energy]], which is actually very conducive and helpful to where we're going, or similar to where we're going anyway. I wouldn't necessarily, obviously, give that to complete beginners. But you guys have had a lot of [[experience]], so if that's kind of [[desire]] coming up, that's good. It's a way of working with it. It can be very similar to _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>_ if I can kind of filter things out and emphasize and open in the right way.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(4) <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Ill-will</a> and [[aversion]]** - I'll split this into two, this hindrance:</span>

##### (a) Ill-will, (i) Metta to the one I'm upset with (ii) to myself
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^5-6" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^5-6" class="internal-link">5-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> (6) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (3) · <a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> · <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> (2) · <a data-href="Feelings" class="internal-link">Feelings</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (3) · <a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a> · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Pain" class="internal-link">Pain</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(a) <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Ill-will</a>** means, actually, I'm getting really upset with someone here, so much so that I wish them harm. **(i) _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Mettā</a>_**, obviously. You switch - if it's really strong, you know, if [[breath]] is your base practice, just switch to _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_. I need to deal with this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">ill-will</a>. I absolutely [need to], because when that's there, it's not going to help. It's really going to get in the way. **(ii)** But there's another possibility within that, which is: when I have <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">ill-will</a> towards someone, or [[aversion]] towards someone, or I just don't like them, and the [[mind]] is in that kind of nasty state (however gross or subtle), actually, what I can do then - so first thing, I think, "Oh, I give _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ to that person," which is great. That might really help. But there's a second possibility, which is actually, bring the [[attention]] back to myself without trying to change the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">ill-will</a> or how terrible this person is, or those kinds of thoughts and [[feelings]]. ==**Bring the [[attention]] back to myself, and actually notice and feel the _[[dukkha]]_ of that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">ill-will</a> _here_ .** _It's in_ my _heart. There's a taste in my mouth. It's a flavour in my [[energy body]] and my [[consciousness]]. It's_ [[dukkha]]. It's painful. So I'm not trying to change the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">ill-will</a>. I just come back, and I feel what's happening. Don't judge, just: "What does it feel like? Oh, it's _[[dukkha]]_." And feel the [[pain]] of it. I just have to let my [[consciousness]] touch the [[pain]] there.==</span>

##### Self-compassion (like any compassion) will soften everything
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^6-1" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^6-1" class="internal-link">6-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Pain" class="internal-link">Pain</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (5) · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=21:43" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">If I'm doing that, if I'm just letting it touch it, then what can happen is, when I touch that [[pain]], when I come into contact, it turns into [[compassion]] for myself, okay? Self-[[compassion]]. You think, "Yeah, but my problem is with the other person." It doesn't matter. Once there's self-[[compassion]], there's [[compassion]]. It's a new [[energy]] in the system, and it will soften everything. So my self-[[compassion]] starts changing my relationship with this other person. That's really, really useful as well.</span>

##### (b) Aversion towards certain noises
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^6-2" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^6-2" class="internal-link">6-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(b)** What can also happen - and what you will, I'm sure, notice happening over the course of the [[retreat]] - is that **we get aversive at certain noises**: the heating, or the birds, the rooks, which are a lot quieter than they used to be, say, ten or fifteen years ago, for some reason. And it's like, "Oh, those _crows_ are so _loud_," or whatever it is, and "I'm trying to meditate, and they're _bothering_ me." Or this person is just, "Every time they get up, their bones creak," like my bones creak or whatever, something, or their breathing. <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> at noise, which could include [[aversion]] at a person or another sentient being, or whatever it is.</span>

##### (i) Remember the goal and make an effort
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^6-3" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^6-3" class="internal-link">6-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> (4) · <a data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhanas</a> (3) · <a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=23:01" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(i)** This is going to be really common, okay? I have to **remember the big picture, the goal**. Where am I going in practice? I'm certainly not going towards more [[aversion]]. I'm going towards less [[aversion]]. That's what I want. It's not even _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ is my primary goal. **It's less [[aversion]], less _kilesa_, [[freedom]] from the defilements.** _Just remind myself, "What do I want? **I want to get to a place where there's less [[aversion]], I'm less bothered by noise, I'm more open, there's more [[love]]**, etc." So again, what does that imply about how I should practise the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_, and what kind of way I'm holding, and my view of the whole thing? Is it possible, can I find a way of practising the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_ that is not so bothered, that kind of _includes_ sounds, and coming and going, and noises? Not bothered, but not throwing out the baby with the bathwater: "Oh, I don't need to make an effort, then." So some attitude, view, or stance here that's really, really possible.</span>

---
##### (ii) Opening to the sound and including it
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^6-4" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^6-4" class="internal-link">6-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(ii)** Sometimes what you can actually do is, again, **deliberately let the primary object go, and open up more to sound, and a sense of really including that**. And again, I'm doing the opposite thing of [[aversion]]. I'm opening to sound and including it. I'm not saying, "Oh, that's _other_ than what I'm trying to do." I'm opening to sound, including it, and then that starts changing the way I feel about the sound. And then within that, keeping that openness, actually, then I can reintroduce the primary object, but I've got it in a much bigger space, and a much bigger attitude, a much bigger orientation.</span>

---
##### (iii) Turn down any aversion in the mind, which helps sukha to arise
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^6-5" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^6-5" class="internal-link">6-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhanas</a> (2) · <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> (4) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(iii)** You know, technically, we'll get to this when we talk about the second _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, but actually, technically, if in any moment, you could just quite significantly **turn down any [[aversion]] in the [[mind]]**, you would come very close to the second _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_. _Sukha_ would arise. <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> would arise. With a lot of practice - or actually, maybe, again, this is just one of those things. Just try. ==I say, well, just try. Sometimes I say, "Okay, just turn down the [[aversion]]." You say, "What do you mean, 'turn down'? I don't know how to do it." Just try. Just try to turn down the [[aversion]], because turning down the [[aversion]] can then just directly give rise to [[happiness]], give rise to _sukha_.==</span>

### (5) Doubt tends to paralyze
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^6-6" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^6-6" class="internal-link">6-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=25:33" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(5)** _Okay, last one: **doubt**. We can doubt the teacher, we can doubt the teachings, and we can doubt ourselves. There's probably lots of other stuff, but those are the three sort of common ones. So what's the difference between questioning and doubt? **Doubt often involves an absence of questioning**, in fact, or an absence of letting questions blossom and grow into an inquiry that's actually helpful. Doubt tends to paralyse. We get stuck in a kind of confusion or this and that. We're not actually questioning anything. The [[mind]] is just shuttling back and forth or going round in a circle. So sometimes, underneath all that, there's actually a question or two or three that need to get clarified and formulated, and perhaps asked to oneself or to a teacher. But we haven't let the question form yet. And we're just stuck in this kind of unclear shuttling back and forth. So _is_ there a question there?</span>

---
##### Once we've got a question it's no longer paralysing - but postponed to after formal practice
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^7-1" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^7-1" class="internal-link">7-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (3) · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=26:42" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**Once we've got a question,** it's no longer paralysing. Even formulating it clearly will help. We'll feel unparalysed. And **then formulating and asking and engaging will be really helpful.** But doubt paralyses. And so, just one thing to bear in [[mind]] is timing, here. **When am I going to wrestle with this either question or doubt? "Outside of the [[meditation]]" is the answer.** In other words, yeah, there's something I'm really not sure about. I'm confused. I have a question, and I can't proceed until I have an answer. Just, "This is my [[meditation]] time, so I'm just going to put that aside. But I promise you, [[mind]], that I will get to this question, and I will think about it, I'll ponder it, I'll inquire, I'll ask something later." You make a deal with the [[mind]]. It's like, "We're going to get to this. I'm not ignoring it." But it happens outside of the formal practice.</span>

#### Exchanging happiness of self and other
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^7-2" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^7-2" class="internal-link">7-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Seeing That Frees" class="internal-link">Seeing That Frees</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (4) · <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> · <a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">How many people have heard of the practice of **exchanging the [[happiness]] of self and other**? A few of you. It's a huge practice, infinite possibilities. I think there's quite a large section about it in the book I wrote, _<a data-href="Seeing That Frees" class="internal-link">Seeing That Frees</a>_.^[Rob Burbea, _Seeing That Frees: Meditations on Emptiness and Dependent Arising_ (Devon: Hermes Amāra, 2014), 322-6] At some point, you can visit that. I want to say it's a really, really beautiful practice. It's one of the most gorgeous explorations you can do as a meditator, and full of creative possibilities and lovely, luscious possibilities of transformation. In a nutshell, here I am, pretty miserable from some hindrance attack or whatever, and I say to myself, "You know what? I'll take this. I'll take this because somewhere, someone else - maybe someone I know, maybe someone I don't know and will never know - someone, somewhere else correspondingly, by magic, I'm taking their _[[dukkha]]_, and they can have the [[happiness]]." So again, technically, you could say, well, what am I doing there? ==Instead of the automatic, natural [[aversion]] to the [[hindrances]], I'm actually saying, "Come, come, I'll take this." But it has heart in it. It has this, "I'm willing to take this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> right now. I'm opening myself to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> for the sake of the release from <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> of someone else, somewhere." So it's a kind of, you could say, 'magical thinking' - it doesn't matter - using your imagination, whatever.== There are all kinds of variations on that with [[emptiness]] and stuff, but that's the nutshell of it. It's a very beautiful thing.</span>

##### With the hindrances around there's often not enough heart

<span class="paragraph">And often what happens, with the [[hindrances]] around, is there's no heart as well. Everything's got squeezed, miserable, and there's no heart. One possibility is bringing the heart in, in that very beautiful way. So you could do that with physical discomfort as well: "I can take this [[pain]] right now. I _will_ take this [[pain]] right now. I'm willing to take this [[pain]] for the sake of someone else's ease, someone else's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a>."</span>

<span class="paragraph">Like I said, we have to get clear a few things about the [[hindrances]]: one is that there are subtle [[hindrances]] as well. So everyone's used to really gross [[hindrances]], and it's generally what we get taught about when you first hear about the [[hindrances]] on [[insight]] <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a> and stuff like that. But they also manifest very, very subtly. And as I said, there's a [[sutta]] in the _Majjhima Nikāya_ where the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s talking, and he's talking about subtle [[hindrances]], and he lists all these subtle [[hindrances]].^[MN 128] So things like elation and [[inertia]], [[fear]], slight over-efforting, slight under-efforting - very, very slight, he's talking about. <a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a>, if it's not handled well. <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> of multiplicity - you know, just in a way, too much [[awareness]] of different things. There's a whole list there. But the point is, there's a whole range of subtlety. And in a way, there's always something to play with and work with and experiment with, something that can be tweaked a little bit.</span>

##### We are not looking for hindrances in jhana practice, but are ready to work with them

<span class="paragraph">Of course, there are some times in _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice where all that goes, and we're not actually aware of any [[hindrances]]. And that's fine. You don't have to go looking for them at that point. You just get into the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a> of it. As you get more into the territory of a _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, then you start to realize the kind of more subtle [[hindrances]] that might be there, or possibly be there at times, that at first you don't realize. It's not that we're always looking. We're not at all always looking for [[hindrances]] with _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice. We're actually inclining more to what's pleasant and easeful, and enjoying. But they will come up subtly.</span>

##### Micro-negativity of the mind

<span class="paragraph">Let me point out something else that I want to come back to on the [[retreat]], and actually emphasize quite a lot. And it's something that, I think, gets clearer through _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice than through [[insight]] and [[mindfulness]] practice. And it's a kind of very common micro-negativity of the [[mind]]. So you might be sitting there with a very nice [[energy body]]. You might be sitting there with _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>_, etc., whatever it is, and you might be quite used to it by that point. But it's still pretty nice. Most people would give their right arms for what you're experiencing in that moment. But you've experienced this kind of thing before, and =="The other day it was _better_ than it was today." [laughter] And "I know it _can_ be a bit better." And in this kind of very subtle way, the [[mind]] is inclining towards what's wrong, what's not quite as good as it should be.==</span>

##### Cup half-full, half-empty on a really subtle level, seeing through a negative lens

<span class="paragraph">Part of that is okay. It's part of the shaping. It's like, again, the potter with the clay on the wheel. Of course! "So what's wrong? It's not ... it's a bit sort of ..." I'm kind of pressing it. But when it has a flavour of [low complaining noises], when it has that negativity - we're talking, this can get _incredibly_ subtle. It's just a cup half-full, half-empty thing, but on a really, really subtle level. It's just this moment, ==there's something in the way I'm seeing this and relating to this actually really lovely thing, and I'm somehow spinning it with a negative - I'm seeing it through a negative lens. This is incredibly common, and it's what we might call, like, a really deep, deep, almost base-level _kilesa,_ defilement, of [[aversion]] in the mind.== This, you'll notice more and more as things go on, and it's something that's actually really important to address and work with.</span>

##### Jhana practice helps you notice this micro-subtle defilements

<span class="paragraph">The really good news is that we notice this much more in - you'd think you'd notice it more in [[mindfulness]] and [[insight]] practice; you actually notice it much more in _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice. And you'll get much closer to it, and you'll see it working at a much, much subtler level, and you'll be able to do something about it. And what I want to say right now is - and I'll repeat this, and other things - we just notice it. ==Expect it, notice it, find the pleasure, get into enjoying it. Find what's nice, get into enjoying it. So we just make a micro-movement.== We're talking about a micro-subtle defilement. We just make a micro-shift of relationship and attitude, yeah? But in a way, we could construe that as a subtle hindrance, absolutely.</span>

### Sinking and drifting

<span class="paragraph">Okay, and again, in terms of subtle [[hindrances]], there are two forms called 'sinking' and 'drifting.' I don't know where these words come from. I don't know if they're originally in the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>; I've never come across them in the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>. I picked them up from - I think it was Kamalashila.^[Probably the modern Kamalashila rather than the eighth-century Kamalaśīla. For discussions of 'sinking' and 'drifting,' see _Kamalashila,_ Meditation: The Buddhist Way of Tranquillity and Insight, 2nd edn (Birmingham: Windhorse, 1996), 165-74] I can't remember. But they're around now in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma culture</a>. So, 'drifting' and 'sinking': what does that mean?</span>

---
##### (1) Drifting: a tendency to drift off objects, (2) sinking: being not quite so bright
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^9-1" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^9-1" class="internal-link">9-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (4) · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=35:04" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(1) Drifting**_ _is a sort of subtle version of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a>, and really, what it means is, the [[mind]] is still alive, you're still <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a>, you're nowhere near, like, jumping out of your skin or anything like that, or obsessed with worrying, or that kind of thing. The [[mind]] is present. Everything's good. It's kind of with its object. But there's just a bit more tendency for it to drift off the object, or sometimes it manifests as just a bit more thoughts and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a> in the [[mind]], and a little bit more tendency of the [[mind]] to get pulled off into them. So again, we're talking about something quite subtle. **(2)** And **sinking** is the subtle version of sloth and torpor. Again, nowhere near nodding or falling asleep or anything like that; it's just a little bit of dullness comes in. It's not quite so present, so alive, so bright, so sharp.</span>

---
##### Both drifting and sinking can come from either too much or too little effort
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^9-2" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^9-2" class="internal-link">9-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> (2) · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=36:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">These are interesting [[hindrances]], because oftentimes, what they're most related to is effort levels. Again, we're back to this question, this issue of effort levels, and the fact that I cannot avoid that issue. I cannot avoid that parameter of practice. As you get deeper and deeper in _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, a tiny bit too much effort, just a little bit too much effort, or a little bit less so, makes proportionately more of a difference, and more of an impact. In other words, again, the deeper we go, the more sensitive the whole system is. And a bit too much effort, a bit less effort actually kinds of gets in the way, or causes problems, has more of an effect at a deeper level. So with these subtle [[hindrances]], sinking and drifting, one of the things that's really worth paying [[attention]] to is just the effort levels, and seeing, like what we were saying earlier today, what is it just to back off the intensity? Or perhaps to move, in my directionality, from more of a probing to more of a receiving. In other words, what I wanted to say is, both sinking and drifting can arise from _either_ too much effort, very slightly, _or_ too little effort - paradoxically sounding. ==We don't know. What do you have to do? You have to just get in there and play, play with that subtle effort: bit more, bit less, bit more intense, bit less intense, bit more probing, bit more receiving, bit more delicate - you know, whatever it is.==</span>

##### Simile: squeezing a banana
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^9-3" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^9-3" class="internal-link">9-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2) · <a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">And sometimes, one of the ways I like to think about this is, for example, with the drifting, why is there more thought? Why does the [[mind]] go? We're squeezing the [[mind]] too tight, and (in a completely incommensurate [[image]]) it's a bit like squeezing a banana skin, and the banana comes shooting out. [laughter] Maybe that's not the greatest analogy. But again, going back to what we said before, ==the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a> can reveal the effort. Even just the size of the [[attention]] can also affect this.==</span>

### Hindrances happen on a spectrum

<span class="paragraph">So there's lots of things to try, but one main point to take is the _spectrum_. We're really talking about a spectrum. When we talk about [[hindrances]], we're really talking about a spectrum, despite what the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> said as, "With the abandonment of the [[hindrances]], with seclusion from the [[hindrances]], arises the first _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_." Yes, that's true, _and_ at another level, we're talking about a whole spectrum here that's not going to go away, in one form or another. Sometimes even in _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ - again, 'in' inverted [commas], using that word in a slightly loose way - you can be, here's the [[happiness]]. Here's the brightness, the luminosity, and the [[happiness]], and it's as if at the edges of that [[happiness]] and brightness, at the edges of [[consciousness]], there's like a whole little pack of little terrier dogs sort of yapping away. And it's not that they're in the middle causing mayhem or really loud, but you're just aware of them there. ==Are you in the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ or are you out of the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ ? It's an irrelevant question, 'in, out' - where's the intelligence here? The question is, what do I need to do at that point? What needs to happen?==</span>

<span class="paragraph">One of the things: what do I need to pay [[attention]] to? Let's say, here's this luminous [[happiness]] right there. Here are these little terriers yapping. I'm just going to really get into that [[happiness]], and I'm going to open my <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> to it, open my [[mind]] to it. We'll talk about all this. Now, it might be that in doing that, the terriers nicely quieten down and fall asleep or whatever. But it might be they stay there, and actually, that's as good as it's going to get right now. Okay. So I've got this really nice, lovely, yummy, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Juiciness" data-href="Juiciness" class="internal-link">juicy</a> [[happiness]], which the person who gave their right arm for the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>_ would now give their left arm as well for. And don't worry! The terriers are there. It's not a problem. Just get into and enjoy it. And don't worry about this 'in' and 'out' business. It's just how _not_ to consume the [[mind]] with questions that are not relevant. But also, sometimes, it's the terriers yapping, _da-da-da_, I'm kind of 'in,' _da-da-da -_ but let me go to the terriers, see what they need, and see if I can do something that encourages them to do something else. ==So it's not like there's always a formula, but one formula is: "It's okay. This is the deal right now. This is as good as it's going to get."==</span>

<span class="paragraph">Sometimes there are [[hindrances]] in different forms. Sometimes a hindrance arises, just - is it a hindrance? No, it's just that the [[energy body]] - it's not that my [[mind]] is consumed with this or that. It's just that the [[energy body]] feels a little constricted or blocked. I'm not obsessed with this, I'm not thinking about that, I'm not lost in [[desire]] or doubt or any of that. It just feels a little bit blocked. We could call that a subtle hindrance, if you want. Or it's just that the [[energy body]] kind of won't settle down, or the _[[citta]]_ won't really settle down. It's not even from gross distraction or thought; it's something just a little agitated in the [[energy]] of the _[[citta]]_ or the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>.

<span class="paragraph">Or sometimes - and again, this is something that may be for some of you, or _will_ be for some of you later, may be relevant for some of you now - sometimes it's amazing: if you have quite a lot of [[experience]] in and out of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_, sometimes it's just like, it's almost like you can just dive underneath something.

And like I said, it's a bit like the radio frequencies or the wardrobe: the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_ are there anyway, and you can kind of just point the [[mind]] to a level that's actually really peaceful.

And you point the [[mind]], and you just dive underneath a little bit. It's there. And then I'm tuning to that. I'm not getting caught up. Yes, this part of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> doesn't feel quite connected, or feels a bit constricted, or the [[mind]] - so I'm just pointing to that, I dive into it, and then what's my work there? I've dived in. Now I'm in touch with that peacefulness. Now what? Now I need to work with that, get into it, enjoy it, open to it, focus on it==, etc. We'll talk about more of that. ==So it's not _really_ that the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ is quite there, but something of a doorway to that, something of a trail of that _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ is there, and you can pick it up and just kind of point the [[mind]] there and dive into it== - with practice, with time. So there it is. And once you get that trail or opening, then you work on staying there and stabilizing and absorbing into that, etc.</span>

##### I'm patient while I'm working with the hindrances

<span class="paragraph">As I said, with _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice, we really want this attitude of working with - working _against_, if you like - the [[hindrances]]. We really want this idea of antidote. But we also really want this idea of patience. So I'm _patient_ while I'm _working with_. Really important. ==I'm playing with and experimenting with all that, and I can use all my ingenuity and creativity in how I relate to [[hindrances]] or what might help. And at the same time, I have a firm resolve. I'm not just going to give up now. I'm not just going to get up and walk away, or just sit through it and say, "Oh, whatever. Who cares." There's this combination of working actively, of being creative and ingenious, and a firm resolve and patience, all together.==</span>

##### It's ok to have the hindrance win the battle and just go for a walk
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^11-1" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^11-1" class="internal-link">11-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">Beauty</a> (3) · <a data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">Spaciousness</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So it's not that we want to get kind of locked into a grim battle for hours on end with some hindrance or another. At a certain point, it's like, "All right. You win the battle. You're not going to win the war, but you win this battle, and I'm going for walk," or "I'm going for a cup of tea." Part of that is also just taking the pressure off and opening the [[mind]]. If I go for a walk, it's like the [[beauty]], the air, the light, the [[spaciousness]] - I hope, by the end of this [[retreat]], that everyone knows the [[beauty]] of rain, because you get a lot of practice with that. There's no reason that bad (or so-called 'bad') weather should affect your <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Beauty" data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">sense of beauty</a>.</span>

##### The emphasis if more on cultivating well-being than fighting the hindrances

<span class="paragraph">In a way, what we're doing is, the emphasis is more on cultivating <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a> than kind of fighting the [[hindrances]]. We're doing both, but it's like, it's a certain way of thinking about it. That's the balance. And again, to those of you, or when you have more and more [[experience]], after you've got quite a lot of [[experience]] in and out of different _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_, you sometimes just get a sense of what's possible in any moment. So maybe I'm working on the fourth _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_; it's where my playground is. But there are [[hindrances]] around, whatever, and I'm kind of stuck in the first or second _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, and you just get a sense: no, I can stay with this and shape it, and it will go deeper. Other times you get a sense: "This is as good as it's going to get right now." You just have a feel for it after a while. That takes practice. So still, that's great. You know, that's _really_ good. Just the fact that there's a subtle hindrance blocking you from getting as far as you've got before - no problem. You take what you can get, what's accessible, and you kind of develop a sense of (I don't know what an analogy would be) what's possible in any particular situation.</span>

### Insight in relation to the hindrances
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^11-3" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^11-3" class="internal-link">11-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">All right. To finish, some things about **[[insight]] in relation to the [[hindrances]]**.</span>

---
##### (1) There is an insight of understanding that there is spectrum for each of the hindrances
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^11-4" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^11-4" class="internal-link">11-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> · <a data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhanas</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (2) · <a data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">Avijja</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=45:57" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(1)** One thing I've already said: **the [[hindrances]] are spectra**. They're not on/off. There's a spectrum for each hindrance in terms of really, really gross, more and more, more and more subtle. That's partly just like, I know that, I understand, that's the territory that I'm dealing with. Partly, that has a couple of implications. One is that they will be common visitors. They will be coming and going. If I have the view that "They shouldn't be," or "They won't be," or "After a certain amount of practice, or once I've reached X _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>,_ it won't happen," that's the opposite of [[insight]]. That's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a>. So there's just a certain amount of [[insight]] in recognizing they're spectra, and that means, in one form or another, in one level on the spectrum of grossness or subtlety, they will be coming. I'm aware of that.</span>

---
##### (2) It's not linear
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^11-5" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^11-5" class="internal-link">11-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhanas</a> (2) · <a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> (2) · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Hell" class="internal-link">Hell</a> · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Heaven" class="internal-link">Heaven</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=47:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(2)** Second thing is, **it's not linear**. Yes, they'll be coming and going, and they'll be coming and going even after you reach whatever _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, you know, in terms of what's part of your practice. You might, in other words - how to say this? You could have a much harder time with the [[hindrances]] later on in the [[retreat]] than you did earlier, or something. Or you feel like, "Now I've got to this _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ now. It was going so well, and then suddenly, I'm just in a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hell" data-href="Hell" class="internal-link">hell realm</a>," or whatever. I've said this before in many other talks. If someone comes in to me and they're doing _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ practice, and they just describe this kind of smooth ascent, day by day, into the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Heaven" data-href="Heaven" class="internal-link">Tuṣita heavens</a>, kind of uninterrupted linear graph like that, either they're lying, or they're, again, really not paying [[attention]]. It's more like _this_ : okay, there's a trend, yeah, but it's more like _this_. [non-linear hand gesture] Actually it's more like _this_. [different non-linear gesture] We'll explain. But it's not linear. So again, just because (I'll come back to this in a minute) we had a great time for the last five days, and all this stuff was opening up, it doesn't mean that I'm not going to fall down a hole into the [[hindrances]] tomorrow, or that they will not visit. Let's say that.</span>

##### (3) Do not take the hindrances personally, they are a fact of being human
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^12-1" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^12-1" class="internal-link">12-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> (2) · <a data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Awakening</a> (2) · <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> · <a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a> · <a data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">Personhood</a> · <a data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhanas</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=48:32" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(3)** Third piece about [[insight]] here is, we want to help ourselves to **get to a relationship with the [[hindrances]] where we're really not taking them personally**. They are aspects of being human, until, apparently, one is an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">arahant</a>, and that means fully <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightened</a>. They're aspects of being human. _Taking personally_ - what I mean by that is, "Oh, I'm a bad meditator," or "This means that I'm" - even worse - "a bad person, because I keep getting this or that hindrance. I keep getting [[aversion]]," or "I keep getting [[desire]]. I'm really greedy," or "I'm this or that." ==<a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> - don't take them personally. They're a human thing. They're like facts of being human, and the arising of a hindrance doesn't mean anything about my capability as a meditator or my worthiness as a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a>. That's really, really important. So, can I encourage that attitude? And that's part of where we want to move towards. That's part of the gift of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice. We begin, after a while, to see: it's not personal.== But we want to really encourage that, not taking it personally.</span>

---
##### (4) Believe the stories that the hindrances spin less and less
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^12-2" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^12-2" class="internal-link">12-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">Stories</a> (2) · <a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> (2) · <a data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">Papanca</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=49:59" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(4)** The second thing, again, we want to move towards - this is the fourth [[insight]] piece now - is that we, more and more, **believe the [[stories]] that the [[hindrances]] spin less and less**. So less and less, over time, do we believe the [[stories]] that the [[hindrances]] spin. What happens is a hindrance arises, and we get convinced that it's actually about this person, that they are the problem. It's not the problem of my hindrance. It's about them. Or it spins a story about me, and oftentimes then it spins this whole _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a>_ thing, that whole <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">proliferation</a>.</span>

##### Hindrances proliferating manifestations of kilesa seeds
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^12-3" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^12-3" class="internal-link">12-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> · <a data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">Avijja</a> · <a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> · <a data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">Stories</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=50:40" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Actually what's happening is a seed of a hindrance arose, which is what happens for human beings. These hindrance seeds just keep coming up - defilement seeds, _kilesa_ seeds, greed, [[aversion]], <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a> - in one form or another, manifest as the [[hindrances]]. ==They're little seeds. And then without <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> and [[mindfulness]], those seeds become huge, huge trees, forests, jungles - jungles, better. Partly what allows them to become a jungle, those seeds, is _believing_ them: believing what they tell us==, believing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a>, believing the [[stories]] that they spin. This is _so_ crucial. As I said, if nothing else happened on the [[retreat]], you didn't have a millisecond of an ounce of a nice feeling, but _that's_ what happened on the [[retreat]], that's really, really good. That would make a huge difference in your life - huge difference.</span>

##### (5) Hindrances are gold ore, there's something really precious here
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^12-4" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^12-4" class="internal-link">12-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (2) · <a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> (4) · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/60867/20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-a_hidden_treasure_the_relationship_with_the_hindrances-60867.mp3#t=51:48" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(5)** And the fifth [[insight]] piece is that, in relation to what I just said, we actually **view the [[hindrances]]**: yeah, they're really unpleasant, but in a way, they're **kind of like gold dust or gold ore. There's something really precious here. I just need to find the right relationship with it.** I can turn it into treasure _if_ I find the right relationship with it, in terms of view and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a>. So they're really like gold dust, like something unrefined and filled with all kinds of not-so-great stuff. But actually there's a treasure there, because as I said, [[hindrances]] will come up in life. It's not just something in [[meditation]]. We think about, what about that creative project? What about that service project? What about your work? What about coming up in long-term relationship? Same things arise. The same [[hindrances]] arise, and they will get in the way of, they will 'hinder.' _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Nīvaraṇa</a>_ is the Pali. It's literally what it means: something that's an obstacle, gets in the way of a going forward. They will do that in all of those other realms of our life. It's not just something about [[meditation]]. If I can get wise to them, if I can learn how to view them in a way that they lose their power - they might still arise as seeds, but they lose their power - that's absolutely huge, and absolutely precious.</span>

##### Sometimes emotions are just the seed of a hindrance
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^13-1" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^13-1" class="internal-link">13-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Emotions" class="internal-link">Emotions</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (2) · <a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">And part of that is, also, I begin to understand something about [[emotions]] as well. And this is really interesting. Something that seemed like "It's this emotion that I'm feeling," I actually see, "Oh, sometimes it's actually just a seed of a hindrance. And the [[mind]] has spun that into a story, and a certain emotion has arisen. But actually, in its root, it was just this hindrance, or mostly this hindrance." Sometimes. So there's something about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> the [[hindrances]] that is actually really important in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> our emotional life. I'm going to come back to that in a sec.</span>

##### Development of subtelty and refinement and discrimination also happens in regard to the hindrances
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^13-2" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^13-2" class="internal-link">13-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> · <a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">The fact that they're spectra - there's a range - is part of this development of subtlety, because I recognize, they're going to get more subtle. My [[attention]] has to get more subtle to even pick up on subtle [[hindrances]], and then work with them. So when we talked yesterday about how, I would say, it's so important, ==this development of subtlety and refinement and discrimination - that also happens in regard to the [[hindrances]]. In terms of our overall trajectory, this recognition and working with the subtlety of the spectrum of the hindrance is also part of that whole development of subtlety. Yes, it's much nicer, attuning and discerning to subtle differences of _this_ kind of exquisite peacefulness versus _that_ kind of exquisite peacefulness, but in terms of developing the whole subtlety - which again, is so important for our emotional life and all the rest of it - that's important too. It's all subtlety. It's all discrimination. It's all attunement.==</span>

##### I'm not longer dragged along by the story of what the hindrances tell me, there is letting go, i.e. insight
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > ^13-3" data-href="1219 A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#^13-3" class="internal-link">13-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> · <a data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">Letting go</a> (2) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">In terms of not taking [[hindrances]] personally and not believing them, can you hear that that's about [[letting go]]? It's about having [[insight]] into what they are. I see you, what you are, and I let go. I'm no longer dragged along by this story or this identification. There's a [[letting go]]. It's [[insight]]. Yeah?</span>

##### Backlash after it had been going really well

<span class="paragraph">Last thing: if you do enough of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice, what you'll begin to notice is what seems like a kind of backlash - it's as if it's going really well, and maybe even a new territory opens up. I've gotten to a new opening or a new state or a new wonderful thing happened. And I'm in that for a little while, however long that little while is - half a day, three days, or whatever it is, a few hours, even - and then all [[hell]] breaks loose. And sometimes it can seem like, it's almost like the very opening caused a kind of backlash, that there was a kind of reaction to it somehow. It's not like every time, kind of expect it, but there seems to be something like that. There seems to be.</span>

##### Is this some kind of catharsis, purification? (like some traditions say)

<span class="paragraph">And it raises a lot of questions. I mean, again, I need to expect it, etc., don't take it personally, and it's not linear, all that. But is there some kind of catharsis, some kind of purification going on here? I know people who have exactly that view: that what we're doing in _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice is somehow allowing a kind of karmic purification of our _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sankhara" data-href="Sankhara" class="internal-link">saṅkhāras</a>_ and our [[emotions]]. Some people have that view.</span>

<span class="paragraph">I would be a little more cautious. So I don't want to rule that out, but I would rather take both views: yes and no. Again, if I step back from that, what we want is a range. Remember this thing I said? I want you to have a range. Do you remember me saying that? I want you to have a range in regard to your [[emotions]]. We want this range in relationship to our [[emotions]], and with regard to the ways of working and the ways of viewing emotion. I would like you to have a really big range. I can work with [[emotions]] in lots of different ways. I can view [[emotions]] in lots of different ways. And I have a whole range of [[emotions]] as well.</span>

##### Over time it becomes almost undeniable that an emotion is an fabrication

<span class="paragraph">But if there's a lot of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice, and if we're allowing that _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice - over a long time, I mean - to give rise to [[insight]], we will begin more and more to recognize the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a> [[nature]] of [[emotions]]. We tend to think, "An emotion is a real thing. It arises by itself. It's there. And it's just sort of, I have to deal with that because it's a truth." Over time - we may or may not get more into this, and I know it's a sensitive [topic] - but it becomes almost undeniable that an emotion is a [[fabrication]]. ==Without me _doing_ something, usually unconsciously, it cannot arise as that emotion. It cannot get <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a>. It cannot get constructed. So in the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s words, we "see a hindrance as a hindrance,"^[Cf. the Buddha's statement at DN 22: "One dwells seeing phenomena as phenomena in terms of the five hindrances" _(dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati pañcasu nīvaraṇesu)_] and not necessarily as an emotion. We recognize what's there. It's a '[[fabrication]],' or in other language, it's actually 'empty.'== An emotion is empty.</span>

##### I can see an emotion as empty or see it as real, I'm not parking in either one

<span class="paragraph">But if you remember back to the first night, I said, "I can see an emotion as empty, and I can see it as real." I'm not parking in either one. I have the possibility to shift between views. To me this is absolutely crucial. Most often, people park in either one, and that becomes their view. For me, it would be catastrophic and tragic to _only_ ever have the view, _always_ have the view that [[emotions]] are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrications</a>. I would _never_ want to _only_ have that view. But both views become available. And therefore ==the view of catharsis, the view of, "Yes, something is purifying here. I may not even know what, but I sit through it as a purification," and then I have a whole stance with that and relationship with it - or the view that "It's _not_ that. They're <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrications</a>, and I need to get interested in the [[fabrication]]." They're both there. But as we practise certainly _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_ more and more, we begin to "see a hindrance as a hindrance" more and more, as the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> might say.==</span>

##### Over time, self-view manifest less as papanca and more as pure hindrance

<span class="paragraph">And what happens, as we said, is it's not linear. It's very up and down. But there is a movement, over a long time with _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice, that what might manifest more as _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a> -_ like really extreme agitation, and lostness in story, and believing everything, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a> and all that - actually begins to manifest less as _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a>_, and more as just pure hindrance. ==So over time, there's this kind of sifting away, filtering away of the more _papañcizing_ element of the [[mind]]. And it becomes: "It's just the hindrance." It might still be quite strong; I'm really quite restless in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, but there's no story attached to it. There's no lostness. What was usually _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a>_ becomes more just, "I'm just dealing with a hindrance now."== And then over time, even the [[hindrances]] themselves - more and more, they tend to be on the subtle side of things, but they're still there. ==So, over a long time of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice, there is this movement of shaving away the gross, getting down to the [[hindrances]], and then even more subtle. But they stay. They're part of the deal. And we need to be okay with that, really up for that.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">Okay? [laughs] Sorry. I was going to take some questions, but we already had a couple, and I think it's probably enough now. So let's just sit for a minute together.</span>
<span class="paragraph">(silence)</span>
<span class="paragraph">Thank you, everyone. Enjoy tea, enjoy your evening practice, and I think there are a few interviews this evening. So if you haven't checked already, just check that that's not you. And see you tomorrow.</span>
