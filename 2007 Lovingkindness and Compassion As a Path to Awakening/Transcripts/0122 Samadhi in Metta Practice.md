So I'd like to talk a bit today about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, which is a word some of you may be familiar with. It's a Pali and a Sanskrit word, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. And go into the meaning of that and the development of that and some different aspects and implications of it. When we were thinking about this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, we thought, one of the primary questions was, "Well, is it going to be helpful to people? Is it going to be worthwhile for people?" And I reflected on it a little bit, and I thought, "Well, people will develop <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, which is a lovely thing. They'll develop that quality of heart. And then, hopefully, there'll be the exposure, the chance to open to the kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span> that come from <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice. And then also there'll be the opportunity to develop <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>." So three possibilities, any of which, or any amount of which, are all completely worthwhile, would make this time here worthwhile to someone<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Metta develops the heart insight and samadhi" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Metta develops the heart insight and samadhi" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1

So this word <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> in different traditions actually means different things. I'd just like to use it in quite a particular way. Traditionally - rather, in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddhism" data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhist tradition</a></span> - not maybe what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> meant, but what has come out of that is actually that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice is something that's pretty much only good for <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. I'll explain what that means. Also what's come to us through the tradition is that this word is usually translated as '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a></span>,' and with a particular meaning to the word '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a></span>,' meaning the way sort of laundry detergent is concentrated. [laughs] You know, it's like a lot of it in a very small space. [laughter] In other words, a very _narrow_ focus of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, a kind of microscopic - looking at <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> through a microscope. And that has come to be implied in the word <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Samadhi is often translated as concentration" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi is often translated as concentration" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2
###### 1-3
Now, there is some benefit to being able to make the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> small and narrowly focused like that. There's a certain amount of power in it. But if one goes back to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>, and looks through all the volumes of what he said, you can't actually find anything implying anything like that at all. For some reason, that's what's come to us. So rather, I would like to use <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> in what I feel is more the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s sense of the word, which is more something like '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness</a></span>': <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness of mind</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness of mind</a></span> and heart and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. Something maybe even better: '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a></span>.' Because there's a sense - as John was talking last night - you know, often we're kind of out of contact with the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, a little distant from the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, or the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> feel like two very separate things, disjointed. Or the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is just scattered here, memory, planning, worry, whatever it is, obsession. And so <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> is this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> - <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, and the heart<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Better collectedness even better unification" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Better collectedness even better unification" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3
###### 1-4
One of my teachers uses the phrase, uses the translation, 'depth of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>,' which I like very much. So <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> is really pointing to a sense of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> process, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> sinking in a very lovely way into its depths, in the way that the sea is calm in its depths. Now, we can talk about a range of states of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, certainly. We can also talk about a continuum, a continuum of depth, a continuum of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a></span>. And this is, _I_ feel very much it's a lifelong exploration. So it's not just something that's a little bit, then we forget about. It's something that all of us as human beings have the potential to grow into and to explore, and usually it's a very gradual, very slow process of exploring<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Its a continuum of depth and a lifelong exploration" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#It's a continuum of depth and a lifelong exploration" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4
###### 2-1
So it's an investigation, a lifelong investigation, exploration of the depths of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, of the depths available in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>. Also of the kind of expanded <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span> that come about when the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> deepens. And all of this, not to grasp too much at these words or the possibilities, but just to know that there are possibilities, and that we can move in a very lovely and gradual way to explore some of this<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Perceptions expands when the consciousness deepens" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Perceptions expands when the consciousness deepens" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
And why? Well, because it _is_ very lovely. It's really, really very lovely. Of the lovely things that are available to human beings, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> is really up there. But more than that - although that's already quite something - we _need_ a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span> in life. We _need_ a sense of loveliness, a deep loveliness, deep <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span>. A <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Beauty" data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">sense of beauty</a></span> that comes with that, a sense of rest, and very _deep_ rest that comes with that. This is something we really, really need as human beings. We're generally pretty frazzled, pretty scattered, pretty undernourished on a heart, on a being level. And often we don't even realize that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > We need a sense of deep nourishment" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#We need a sense of deep nourishment" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
So this rest then allows us to be actually more available to others, which of course is a big part of what <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> is about; more available to others, more available to ourselves, more available to life. And brings a freshness to life. It's almost like the quality of life actually can begin to feel like, or actually it _does_ increase as the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> learns to settle down that way. Freshness to life, fresh discoveries in life come out of this settledness of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a></span>. Fresh <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>. And really a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a></span> in that, so that our typical way of being in the world, which is, "I'm here, you're there, we're separate, I'm trundling along in my life," all this, this is part of the human condition, that with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> we're actually maximizing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> to other <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a></span> ourselves, seeing others, seeing life. And it's those other <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a></span> that are potentially liberating. So the significance of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> is actually huge. It's huge<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > With samadhi we are maximizing the receptivity of the mind" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#With samadhi we are maximizing the receptivity of the mind" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
Usually when people talk about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, they're talking about taking one object, like the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> - which we've now put aside, and working with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> - or the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> is one object. So in the instructions here, we're taking one object, which is the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, and just the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> staying with that as much as possible. And that's usually what's implied in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, staying with one object. But actually, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> in itself, in the broad sense, is something bigger than that, and it can be that we actually have a very _open_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, and not necessarily staying with one object, but there's a sense of this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a></span> happening because of the non-entanglement with things that come up. There's just a free, open, easy, and wise relationship with what's coming up. And that wise relationship brings the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a></span>, brings the depth of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. It doesn't have to be just with one object. And perhaps as the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> - in fact, _definitely_ as the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> goes on, we'll be exploring what that means to open it up too<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Samadhi doesnt have to be with just one object" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi doesn't have to be with just one object" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 2-5
Usually the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> moves - even if we're practising, you know, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is on this, and then it's on that, and then it's on this. So the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is moving a lot. And oftentimes, even if we think we're being <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a></span>, the relationship with what we're <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a></span> of is actually not all that skilful. There is some degree of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a></span> what we don't like, or trying to hang on or something. It's not that skilful, not that conducive to depth of calm<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > The mind is moving a lot which is not conducive to calm" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#The mind is moving a lot which is not conducive to calm" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-5
###### 2-6
We'll see as the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> goes on that actually to have a relationship of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> with what comes up, is actually - well, potentially - _the_ most skilful kind of relationship to have with what's going on. And that skilful relationship brings with it this depth, this deepening, I should say<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Metta is the most skilful relationship to have with whats going on" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Metta is the most skilful relationship to have with what's going on" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-6

So of all the things that it's possible for a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> to understand or master or have some skill in - you know, you can think, I don't know if you all know what the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Guinness Book of Records" class="internal-link">Guinness Book of Records</a></span>_ is? It's this sort of big book of weird things that people … [laughter] And they get famous because they can do that more or better or faster than anyone else. And so things like, you can stack coins on your elbow and then do _that_ [moves arm] and catch them all in one hand. And some people stack whatever, sixty coins and catch it. And some of it's pretty amazing, you know. [laughter] But if we really think … And actually, some things are very beautiful - the ballet or musical facility, or you see a great football player or basketball player, there's something, I feel, very deeply beautiful in that. But to really ask, actually: in this life, of all the things, the skills, the crafts that we could develop, what's really worth developing? And this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> is something that a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>, it's one of their best friends to have some facility in that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Samadhi is really worth developing Guinness Book of Records" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi is really worth developing Guinness Book of Records" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
And we often underestimate its importance, and its power, and its significance, but if you look at the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s teachings, I mean, it's hard to just turn a few pages without him going on and on, it seems, just constantly repeating himself about the importance of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. I feel that so far in the West - and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> is very young in the West, but - it seems like we've kind of sidelined the importance of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> a little bit. So I'm pretty sure that will change just as the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> grows up in the West, but so far we've tended to sideline it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Compared to what the Buddha says we might have sidelined samadhi a bit in the West" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Compared to what the Buddha says we might have sidelined samadhi a bit in the West" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a></span> is important, as I said. It brings this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span>, this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span>, on a physical level, on an emotional level, on a spiritual level. It also brings <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span>. Just by itself, it brings <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span>. And not only that, but it's like the perfect soil for <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span> to grow in. So when there's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> there, it's really the optimum conditions for <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span> to occur. When the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is scattered and not unified, we can think we see something: "Ah yes, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>. I understand. Fantastic." Or something about the way - our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">particular patterns</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> or difficulty, and we see, "Ah yeah, I see it!" If there isn't that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, what tends to happen is we see it very clear, and then five minutes, five weeks, however long later, it doesn't seem to stick. Somehow it doesn't seem to stick. We've had the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, but it didn't seem to really make a difference to our life. One of the prime reasons for that is there isn't enough <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. The soil wasn't quite right; it wasn't quite rich in the nutrients enough, wasn't quite enough moisture in the soil<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Samadhi is the soil where insights grow" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi is the soil where insights grow" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3
###### 3-4
Sometimes we have <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span> and they're just on the intellectual level: I see it with my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. But there's something about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, because it involves the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>, the whole being, actually the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span> really go deep, very deep down, and they stick, almost like they're in the cells or in the bones<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Samadhi goes to the cells and bones" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi goes to the cells and bones" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-4
###### 3-5
How do we develop <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>? How does it come? We have, as I'm sure you're all aware in just being a day or two <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span> - if you've forgotten, it becomes quite obvious - again, we have lifelong <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span>, basically, of being scattered, of being entangled in things, of not being collected and calm and unified. And that's really a lifelong <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span>. And so, first of all, to have some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> for that. This is - as I said, I think, in the opening talk - it's just part of the human condition<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > We have lifelong habits of being scattered" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#We have lifelong habits of being scattered" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-5

On the most sort of basic level, though, just the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness of practice</a></span> is really what begins to give life to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. So that means there's the schedule - just coming to every sitting, just doing every walking. Don't underestimate the power of something that seems so futile, and not to judge too quickly where it is that our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> seems to be. And this transfers, of course, to everyday life, to have an everyday practice that we do everyday. There's something about the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> of the form. So whatever I feel like - I feel great; I feel really inspired about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>; I feel completely disinterested; I feel like crap - doesn't matter. That <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span>, just the _word_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> of the form, it finds its way inside. It finds its way inside, and slowly, slowly becomes a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness of the heart</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Importance of steadiness" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Importance of steadiness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-6
###### 4-1
And in that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> is the beginning of strength. And this strength is a factor that we really need in life. Sometimes we're just swamped and bowled over by what's happening. Or something happens, and we realize, "Gosh, I was so in it, and it seemed so huge." Why did it seem so huge, and later it doesn't seem so huge? It's because the strength wasn't there, and we're just swayed. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a></span> has this strength in it, but it's a very pliable strength. It's like there's a softness to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. And these are indispensable factors of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> for <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>, and something that we really need, probably more than we realize<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Samadhi has both softness and pliable strength in it" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi has both softness and pliable strength in it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-1

So the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> of form - the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> of the form of sitting and walking - and then the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> of just doing the practice. So returning, in our case now, to the phrases of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> when the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> wanders. And then sometimes it feels like I'm really staying with either a feeling of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, and can really let the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> stay with that for a while, or staying with the phrases. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>'s quite steady for a few moments, or seconds, or even minutes. And so, just that, the simplicity of that - this is how <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> begins. Not to underestimate the power of what seems like the most trivial, basic steps<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Stay with metta for a while thats how samadhi begins" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Stay with metta for a while that's how samadhi begins" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-2

He said, "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a></span>." It's the thing that most leads to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. A happy <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> can settle itself, can become unified, can sink into the beautiful depths<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Happiness is the most significant cause of samadhi" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Happiness is the most significant cause of samadhi" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-3

So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> is actually a fruit of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>: when there's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> comes in a very natural way, a very organic way, from that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness</a></span>, from that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a></span>. But the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s saying it's also something that is a _cause_ for <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. This is quite interesting. And in my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, it's absolutely, definitely true. So that when people come <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span>, especially if it's for an extended period of time, just to make sure - you know, we usually make sure with them: "Is everything sorted out in your life, as much as possible?

So this kind of simplicity of being actually lends itself to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Happiness is both fruit and cause of samadhi" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Happiness is both fruit and cause of samadhi" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-4

As the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> begins to settle through taking care in the basic ways that I've said so far, what we begin to see is that it's a completely non-linear process. It's completely non-linear. And I've talked to monks who've spent decades living in caves and forests - basically decades of their life, devoted to this exploration of the depth of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. And they say, "Yeah, you know, sometimes it's just really hard. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> just doesn't settle down." It's always going to be like that, always. And not to expect it to be different. It's never a linear process. It's always got to have these waves to it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Its never a linear process" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#It's never a linear process" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2
###### 5-3
One of the signs of maturing in practice is actually we've learnt, we're learning, to expect these waves. So the '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>' - some of you are familiar with this word - the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>. To really expect them and accept them. We can learn to see them out, okay? We can also learn to work with them, and this is really important, because it's not going to be this lovely, smooth ascent into the heavens of bliss. It's going to be pretty much a rough ride. [laughter] And pretty much you can expect every time there's a deepening, somehow, for some reason that I don't think anyone's really figured out yet, there tends to be a backlash. So you feel like, "Wow, that's opened to a new level!", and then all <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hell" class="internal-link">hell</a></span> breaks loose. Don't know why, but that's just the way the human <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> unfolds into depth, for some reason<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Learn to expect and accept hindrances" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Learn to expect and accept hindrances" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-3
###### 5-4
When it's rough, what we can begin to realize is this is just the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> doing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>'s patterns. It's just the human <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> doing the human <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>'s patterns. We don't have to be taken for a ride with it, by it. So for example, I think <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Catherine McGee" data-href="Catherine McGee" class="internal-link">Catherine</a></span>'s going to talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> tomorrow night. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a></span> is one of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>. When I sat down first to do <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, my very first <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> twenty years ago, "Great! Sounds like a great idea." Sat down, listened to the instructions, tried it. _Fuming_ with rage! [laughter] Coming out of my ears, it was! What's going on? <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a></span> is what's going on, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Aversion" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Aversion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-4
###### 5-5
So to expect these things to be there. Now, sometimes they're very subtle, and sometimes they're quite strong. The difference, the important thing is, as we get maturity in the practice, we actually realize, "Oh, it's just <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>. It's not _actually_ that the person sitting next to me deserves to be kicked out of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> or die or something." We tend to think that it's the situation that's a problem. And the maturity is, "Oh, it's just the human <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> with the seed of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>," and that seed of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> has come and made a little, usually ugly, plant of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>. And that's just what it is. And to recognize it for what it is. We don't have to get so caught up in the content of what the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> is saying, or what the greed is saying, or what the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a></span> is saying, or whatever it is, or the doubt<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > We dont have to get caught up in the content of what the hindrances are saying" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#We don't have to get caught up in the content of what the hindrances are saying" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-5
###### 5-6
This is a real sign of maturity: "Oh, it's just that. I don't have to be pulled into the story of it." This comes with practice. It comes with a maturity, and it's just, "Oh, okay, just the hindrance. Strap in!", you know. It's okay. It's really okay. Don't have to be sucked into the story. Also with maturity, we don't have to take it so personally: "Oh, doubt again. Oh, sleepiness again. Oh, greed again. I'm such a lousy meditator. I'm such a greedy person, such an angry person. If I were _da-da-da-da,_ then this wouldn't happen." It's the human <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. In the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s words, it's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>. It's not me, not mine, it's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>. It's not who I am. It's just the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> has these seeds.

In the instructions, we're taking one object, which is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, and we're returning to that. So <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> in that sense, so far. In my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, both for myself and teaching, it's very common for - quite soon, often - when people take an object, whether it's the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, for a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a></span> to come in.

And then there's a sense of, "Ahh," just being with everything, and not staying with an object like the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>. What happens for most people is that when they open out, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a></span> that they felt in trying to stay with one object goes away. And it's like, "Ahh! Lovely!" So the answer is, ditch the trying to meditate on one object, and just kind of relax and open out. And that has a certain benefit to it. But is it possible, actually, that we can find a way of working that doesn't feel tight, or doesn't feel uncomfortable, limited that way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Tightness can come from focus but relaxing the latter is only one way to deal with tightness" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Tightness can come from focus but relaxing the latter is only one way to deal with tightness" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^6-2

How can we practise without this sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a></span> or work with this sense of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a></span>? <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a></span> actually has a kind of softness to it.

One way, or one important factor, is actually that - well, we might say the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, has a bit more breadth to it. So as I say, it's not this totally microscopic thing. A bit more breadth to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, and an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> as a whole: how the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> is feeling, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of the body</a></span> at any time. And the sense of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> at any time. In other words, what's my emotional relationship with the practice right now? Is it tight? Is it disinterested? Is it <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>? Is it striving? And we can actually feel that emotion, and feel it in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, because that will be reflected as a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> if the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> has a certain breadth to it and is aware of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. This breadth is actually a very important factor. When we feel that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a></span>, can we actually just begin to relax it? So, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>, just seeing if that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a></span> can be relaxed in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>.

I was speaking with someone about their <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation practice</a></span> a little while ago, and they were struggling with this for a while. We had a conversation, and they went away. And they actually came back and figured out for themselves - I can't remember what _I_ said, but it obviously wasn't very helpful! [laughter] - they came back and said it was just a matter of actually accepting that the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a></span> was there. And once they had just accepted that, that that's what the quality of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> was, there was just some <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a></span>, it actually made a big difference<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Accepting that the tightness is there" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Accepting that the tightness is there" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-3

As the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> goes on, we'll be talking about even perhaps going a step further, and beginning to turn the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> itself _on_ the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>, on, for instance, a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a></span>.

There needs to be a growing, deepening sensitivity to the whole question of effort. It's really important for <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. It's also very important for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. It's very important for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> too. Sometimes there's more of a relaxed sense, more of a just - let me put it another way: that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> might be _receiving_ the phrases, or _receiving_ the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, if we're working with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>. And sometimes more of a _probing_ sense. And this balance, it's very connected with effort. When it's more relaxed, there's a less efforted space. Very important to play - important word: play - with this balance. This is something we need to explore for ourselves, and make it very personal, very alive, very meaningful for ourselves. We can actually do _this_ and do _this_, and see, "Ah, what's needed now? How does it feel? What are the effects?<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Play with the balance of receiving and probing" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Play with the balance of receiving and probing" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^7-5
###### 7-6
In <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice, this actually has other implications. Already now, we're giving the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> to ourselves. We're _giving_ the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> to ourselves, so we're giving, but we're also _receiving_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. So sometimes in doing the practice, you can tune into the sense of what it is to feel that flow of giving, and sometimes tune into the flow, "I'm _receiving_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. I'm _receiving_ that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">goodwill</a></span>." And what does it feel like to be in the receiving of it? Both are important. Some of us need practice, actually, at receiving <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, not only giving it. Sometimes we, for all different kinds of reasons, we put up barriers and defences to actually receiving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. So sometimes it's good in the practice to really tune into that quality, and feel oneself receiving<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > We are giving metta to ourselves but we are also receiving metta" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#We are giving metta to ourselves but we are also receiving metta" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-6

If there's too much <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a></span>, it can actually cause the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> to spin off in thinking. It's like a banana that's peeled, and you're squeezing it, and it's like, it might shoot off out the end. Somehow, too much <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a></span> in practice actually causes more thought - _can_ do. Sometimes too much relaxation actually causes kind of sinking, which then just spins off into <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="tiredness" class="internal-link">tiredness</a></span>. So this is something that's very delicate; this whole question of effort is very delicate. And it's very connected with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> at a very deep level, actually. When there's effort, there's a sense of "me being somewhere and trying to get somewhere else." Now, there may be some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span> in that, but if we talk about a really boundless <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, a boundless <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span>, there's a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">duality</a></span> there: this and that. I am here, and I want to be there. That <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">duality</a></span>, that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a></span>, at a very deep level, a very deep level of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, that's exactly what gets ended, that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">duality</a></span> - in _all_ things; not just between self and other, but between _things_. So this question of effort is connected, at a very deep level, with a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">duality</a></span>, and a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">duality</a></span> is very much connected with a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > The question of effort is connected with a sense of duality which is connected with a sense of love" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#The question of effort is connected with a sense of duality which is connected with a sense of love" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-7

As I said, it's very delicate. There's a lot to learn from playing with effort and really <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> it for oneself in a practical way. People also shy away from the development of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> because, as I said, because it seems like a goal-oriented practice. But we have all kinds of goals in life, and maybe we actually _need_ goals in life. Some are very simple. You know, at 5:30 when the bell goes for tea, probably most of us, it will be our goal to go and have a drink and eat tea. Where's …? There's no problem in that. It's very simple. Goals don't have to be a problem<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Samadhi as goal-oriented practice" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi as goal-oriented practice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-1

And there also doesn't have to be that much attachment in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. In fact, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> doesn't really lead to a sense of attachment, contrary to what we might hear. This is something that we can really enjoy. When there's the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> calming down that way, we can really begin to tune into that sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a></span>. And that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a></span>, even if it's very quiet, just nothing to really write home about at this point, that is very beneficial and very much what helps the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> deepen. So when there is a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a></span>, just letting the being open to that, letting the being be touched by that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Samadhi doesnt lead to a sense of attachment" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi doesn't lead to a sense of attachment" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-2

So this is actually something - to live in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is to live, is to dwell, in what is divine for a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a></span> is also a kind of dwelling. Where is the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> dwelling? Is it dwelling in that depth, in that stillness, in that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span>? In the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a></span> of that? Or oftentimes, you know, as humans, it's not; it's dwelling in what's really difficult. Actually, obsessing is a kind of dwelling. So some problem, some issue, something about ourselves that we don't like or are having trouble with, or in relationship, and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> just goes round and round and round and round, and just sticks to that, and can't seem to disengage the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> from it. So we're exhausted by the end of the day, and you flop into bed, and you get what's called 'poor man's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>'! You spend the night, and hopefully some relief, and then you wake up, and it just starts all over again. [laughter] But this is where we dwell a lot of the time. And so to deepen in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> is to actually learn - the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> learns to find a home, the heart learns to find a home, a dwelling, in a more lovely space.

When we're doing the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice, what we're actually doing is replacing all that mess of negative thought that's so often around, replacing that with actually thoughts that are skilful, that are helpful, that are calming and conducive to calm. It's actually difficult to have the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> phrases going and be really, _really_ involved in something else. I, some years ago, took on as a practice to do the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> phrases all day, no matter what I was doing, as much as possible - not if I was talking to someone, but just going down the street, or in the shower, or whatever it was. I think it was a few months I did it for, and to really take it on. At first, I noticed there was, "Oh, well, I'd rather be thinking about (whatever it was)", and then I sort of began to give a closer look to what it was that my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> sort of spent its time thinking about. And generally, it wasn't particularly interesting. I don't know if your <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is anything like mine, but it was really not very interesting! [laughter] It was extremely uncreative. I can't even count how many times I had the same thoughts. Very unoriginal, not at all helpful generally. And so very shortly into this time of sort of ongoing <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice, I just thought, "Actually, to have the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> phrases is just way nicer, way more helpful, just a much better thing to have, a much better inner environment.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Metta phrases are more helpful than a lot of the other thoughts we have during the day" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Metta phrases are more helpful than a lot of the other thoughts we have during the day" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^8-4

They begin to lose their compellingness. It's usually a gradual process. And instead we begin to really acquire a taste for a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> that's, a heart that's, unified, that's calm, that's deep. And it really is for most people an acquired taste. It _sounds_ great. I don't know, maybe you're listening and thinking it sounds really boring.

And so in the practice, we can see: we get off onto some train of thought. In the formal practice, [there's] really no need to finish that thought.

Similarly, you can notice if you're doing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">walking meditation</a></span>, you know, maybe you're in the walking room, and someone comes in: "Who is it?" The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> wants to go. It's a natural tendency of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. Or you're outside and a car goes by: "What? Who? Who? What?" Does it make much difference to my sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span> that I know it was a red Ford Escort that went by? Or whatever. Or it was so-and-so that came through. It really doesn't make any difference. And so we learn.

Okay. As this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness</a></span> begins to deepen in the being - probably not for everyone, but for some people at some time - there can arise what's called <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a></span> in Pali. That's usually translated as '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">rapture</a></span>.' And this goes back to what I was talking about, if there's a feeling of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, no matter how subtle or quiet it seems, how 'not so much of a big deal.' Sometimes this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a></span>, this feeling in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, can be extremely strong, so strong that it's uncomfortably strong. The <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span> starts shaking with it, and just really off-the-scale ecstasy. It's quite rare, but it certainly does happen.

So basically I'm just talking about - and again, not to grasp all this stuff, but just to introduce -there's a whole range of what's available in this word, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a></span>, from just a very quiet sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasant feeling</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> (and that may be located in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>; it may be throughout the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>), to really strong, overwhelming waves of ecstasy or bliss. And it's a whole range. It could be like a kind of tingling, or it could be a feeling of lightness, a very pleasant lightness, or expansion that feels very lovely, or warmth<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > The range of piti" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#The range of piti" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-5

Not to grasp at this, but just to know that this, when it comes - and again, this is not permanent; it can't stay forever, but if it comes and when it comes, to open to that as much as possible. Even if it's very quiet. And usually it _is_ very quiet. But just to really allow that in, and actually let the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> go there, and let the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> go into that. So in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice, it might be typical for a nice feeling to be in the heart area, centred around the heart area. And so, to really let that nice feeling be part of the practice. In a way, to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centre the practice</a></span> around that nice feeling, _in_ that nice feeling, in that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a></span>, in that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a></span>.

It's really an art, and it's a lifelong art. So please, not to grasp at any of this.

What allows that? What encourages that? One of the ways, and the sort of most traditional way, is that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is _with_ its object - either the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> or the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> or the phrases - and it's sort of, in one way of thinking about it, it's like rubbing, two sticks rubbing against. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is rubbing against the object, and the friction causes the sparks, and the sparks are the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasant feeling</a></span>. I think that's traditional - I hope I didn't make it up! [laughter] So that's the traditional way: the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, instead of being scattered, it begins, because of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness</a></span>, to actually gather <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>. When it's scattered, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> is being pulled. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">Pīti</a></span>, that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a></span>, that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">rapture</a></span>, is actually a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>. And so, with the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness</a></span> there, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> begins to gather <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> in a very organic, natural way. And then that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> expresses itself as <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > 1 Piti is a kind of energy" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#1 Piti is a kind of energy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-2

Interest is very related to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a></span>. When we're really interested in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>, interested in the feeling, interested in the phrases, that interest lends itself to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a></span>. Sometimes the word <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a></span> is translated as 'interest.' So they're very related.

"Ahh," really interested. Usually it's very quiet outside of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>, but there's that feeling of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a></span>.

Openness of being.

When we get down to it, it's actually a non-entanglement with things. That's the fundamental cause for arising of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a></span>. When the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is not pushing, pulling, obsessing, grappling with things, then there can be that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a></span>. And again, that has very much something to do with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, because <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> is a non-struggle. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Mettā</a></span> towards <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> is a non-struggle with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>.

Very much to be encouraged this openness, this interest, this everything that allows <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a></span>. For some people, for _many_ people, actually, when the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> begins to settle in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, or even also this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a></span> when it comes, it can actually bring <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. It can be quite fearful. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>, one of the five most prominent fears that the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> listed was <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of unusual <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind state" data-href="Mind state" class="internal-link">mind states</a></span>. [laughs] It _is_ unusual. When the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> begins - we're just not used to it, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> settling down. And so there can be some <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> in there. And just to know that's really okay. And if there's a breadth of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, we can be, "Ah, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is settling," I'm aware of that, and I'm also aware, as I said, of my emotion about the practice. Maybe it's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. Can I then, without <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a></span> the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, just very gently incline the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> towards the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a></span> of the depth? Just very gently. We don't need to push anything away.

<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a></span>, as I said, has this quality of softness to it. One of the things that begins to soften with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> is the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of the body</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> softening. The boundaries of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> begin to soften, _can_ begin to soften. What can also begin to soften is the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>.

There can be less of a sense of a 'doer,' a 'meditator.' And this, too, may bring up a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> at times. It can be a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, an existential <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of disappearing, similar to a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>.

What we learn is that our fixed views of self begin to lose their fixity.

So when the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> attenuates, this has a lot to do with the sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, because when there's too much of a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a></span> between self and other, that's perhaps the primary block to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> flowing. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a></span>, in a way, is that coming together, communion. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a></span>, anyway, should, I very strongly feel, it should have <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> in it.

There should also be this quality of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a></span> that I was talking about, just an openness to some kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Wonder" data-href="Wonder" class="internal-link">wonder in being</a></span>. Occasionally I've come across people where that isn't the case. Somehow the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is really, really, really settling down, getting very focused, getting very still, very deep, and there aren't those qualities of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a></span>. A person is moving around, and there's no sense of openness to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span>, a connection. There's no <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love" data-href="Love" class="internal-link">sense of connection</a></span> with the people practising around one. And what I've seen is that that doesn't really bear the fruit. It doesn't really bear the fruit.

And then a situation changed, and there were quite some difficult health issues, very difficult health issues, understandably challenging. But the whole practice went out the window, completely. Not only in terms of as a resource, but actually as a practice. It just stopped. And I feel that for <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> to really go deep in a way that it's really making an impact deep in the being, there has to be that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a></span> there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Receptivity and an openess to some kind of wonder in being" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Receptivity and an openess to some kind of wonder in being" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-6

So finally, I just want to touch on this question, the other reservation that sometimes people can have about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. It's this question of "Am I suppressing? Am I suppressing emotion or some part of my being through collecting the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> that way?" So this is a very delicate question, actually. It's not to rush to too soon an answer, and assume that I _must_ be suppressing<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > I am surpressing something" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#I am surpressing something" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-1

I remember years ago, I had been in a certain kind of relationship with someone. It was actually a teaching relationship with someone, and they were _my_ teacher. It's a long story, but there was a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> there. I felt a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. The relationship had ended, and there was a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. And I went to practise one evening at a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">meditation centre</a></span>, and got quite calm. There was some <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> there, nothing particularly deep. The memory of this person came up, and the beginnings of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. And instead of going off into the whole big production of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> and all the fullness of that, and all the story and everything, because of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, there was just a moment of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> - no sense of repression - and it didn't actually go into anything else. Because of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, there was a clarity, and I actually saw: "Ah! This is something very significant." It's _not_ that - the assumption might be that "This is what's happening. We're angry, and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> is kind of living in me, in my heart, in my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>, waiting to come out. I _need_ to express this." It was rather that, because of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, because of the settledness of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, there weren't the conditions there for that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> to arise in the present - which is a very different <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, and has huge implications about our emotional life as human beings. It has _huge_ implications<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Example story because of samadhi there werent the conditions there for anger" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Example story because of samadhi there weren't the conditions there for anger" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-2

Similarly, there was a work retreatant here a while ago who was experiencing some <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span> and also some periods of real struggle with issues. I can't remember what it was, but it was a whole very involved thing. So I suggested, when the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span> is there, why don't you see if you can just drop in the thought of the issue? Just drop it into the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span> like a drop in the still water. And just see what happens. So she did that, went away and did that, and came back. Nothing happened. And she was so shocked almost by that. Why does nothing happen? Because the conditions aren't there. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, the issue that we think lives whole, ready inside of us, needing to come up, the conditions aren't there in the moment for it to be there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Excercise if calmness is there drop in the thought of a difficult issue" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Excercise if calmness is there drop in the thought of a difficult issue" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-3

It's a very different <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, very significant. So what that means is the issues that we - we have to be delicate with this; you can't make it a black or white thing. I just want to introduce the question, because sometimes things _are_ there, and they _do_ need to come up. But oftentimes the issues that we think are so real, so compelling and so needing to come up - they don't come up, because the conditions aren't there. And we see this with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. They're, we say in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> language, empty of inherent existence. They don't exist by themselves. We usually need to see this over and over. So probably, as I'm saying it, it doesn't sound that significant. But we see this over and over with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, and actually it's something very, very deeply significant<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Issues are empty of inherent existence" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Issues are empty of inherent existence" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-4

We tend to think of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> as we're _creating_ something, we're _creating_ this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span>, we're _creating_ this nice state or whatever. Actually, when we really practise, and we really look at the question of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, you understand it's the opposite: we spend our lives creating things. We spend our lives creating a lot of problems, often, and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, we're beginning to _stop_ creating things.

As we go deeply into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, too, we actually see we're creating less and less when we're doing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, and it's the things that we create that cause barriers.

It leads to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> because we're creating less barriers<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Things that we create cause barriers and with metta samadhi we are creating less" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Things that we create cause barriers and with metta samadhi we are creating less" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-1

So this question - I'm just touching on it briefly now - this question of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of things</a></span> and seeing that through the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice, seeing that through <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, it's hugely significant. I mean, it's probably _the_ most significant thing in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, actually. When we talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>, that's really what it is: it's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, and what does that mean, and what's the effect on the being and the effect on the heart. So we'll be talking hopefully as the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> goes on much more about this and the place of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> in discovering the meaning of that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi in Metta Practice > Awakening to emptiness" data-href="Samadhi in Metta Practice#Awakening to emptiness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-2

But to understand - and it's usually a gradual, slow <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> - to understand this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> brings <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> gradually, slowly, and that's the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> was pointing to.
