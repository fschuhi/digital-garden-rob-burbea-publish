###### 1-1
Okay, so I want to talk in a bit more detail about this practice of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> that we're doing. One possible definition for <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> might be something, _something_, like: the natural response of the heart to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> when that heart, when the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, when the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, is not preoccupied with self, when it's not kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">contracted</a></span> around self, _what I want_, including a negative <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span>, "I'm terrible at all this" or whatever it is. So when that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> around self isn't there, the natural response of the heart when it meets <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> will be this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. That's one possible definition<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Compassion is the natural response of the heart to suffering in absense preoccupation with self" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Compassion is the natural response of the heart to suffering in absense preoccupation with self" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1

So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> differs from <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> in that it's specific to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. It's oriented towards <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. It's a response towards <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, towards <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>. And <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> as an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, it wants to alleviate the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. It wants to heal the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. It wants to go out and to soothe <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. It wants to free, it wants to free <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. We could say, when there's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, when there's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, and that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> meets <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, it kind of transforms into <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > When metta meets suffering it transformsinto compassion" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#When metta meets suffering it transformsinto compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2
###### 1-3
Again, all these - <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> - they're all just words, but the words can be really helpful pointers of what to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a></span>. But in a way, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is a kind of composite. It involves a lot of different qualities, a lot of different aspects to it. It certainly includes what we would call <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a></span>, or what I'm calling <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a></span> - meaning the kind of resonance of the heart with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that it touches, or we see <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, we witness <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in ourselves and others, and there's a kind of trembling of the heart, I think is the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s words. So we see sorrow in someone, and somehow we also feel sorrow. This is, to me, a miraculous quality of the human heart - maybe some animals' as well; I don't know. The heart has a capacity to resonate, in a very beautiful way, with the sorrow that it encounters in the world. So that's a huge part of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Maybe half of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Compassion involves different qualities e g empathy" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Compassion involves different qualities e g empathy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3
###### 1-4
But <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> also has this very active aspect. It wants to give, as I say. It wants to heal and soothe. It wants to do something. So it involves giving. But it also involves, it needs to have <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> in it. It needs to have <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span> in it. It has a basis of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>. It has <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span> in it. The <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> is in it. It needs to have <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span> in it. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a></span> often has humour in it. You know, it's not this very heavy, dry thing. It has listening in it. Holding. It wants to hold <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> sometimes. There's a quality of opening in it. It also has a quality of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Joy</a></span> is running through <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. That's quite important too<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Compassion involves healing equanimity wisdom kindness acceptance humour listening holding opening joy" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Compassion involves healing equanimity wisdom kindness acceptance humour listening holding opening joy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4
###### 1-5
So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is all of that and probably more. And again, like <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, it's not just a feeling. Certainly the feeling aspect of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is important, but it's a whole lot more. It's a whole lot more than that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Compassion is more than a feeling" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Compassion is more than a feeling" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-5
###### 1-6
It's interesting, we all signed up for this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and yet I still feel that most human beings have a somewhat ambivalent relationship with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Despite our - everyone _here_, certainly - the spiritual aspiration to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, to want to deepen the heart that way and open the heart that way, there's still maybe a part of us that kind of is a little bit wary and maybe a little bit scared of it. We can tend to think of it or feel it as a burden: "I've already got so much stuff going on here. Now they're asking me to open to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world." Or, "I've got so much going on just trying to deal with my own stuff, and now I have to somehow feel burdened by the rest of humanity and beings." But I think as we grow on the spiritual path, we really see that it's not a burden. We're not opening ourselves up to _more_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, actually. We're not _taking on_ more <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> through <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Rather, if the heart closes or remains closed to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, that's a burden, that's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. That heart will be small and dry and preoccupied with self, and there's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in that. There will be a burden to that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Many people are wary that they might be taking on more suffering through compassion" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Many people are wary that they might be taking on more suffering through compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-6
###### 2-1
So there is, though - I mean, this is a human thing - we are ambivalent, often, about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. So we have this kind of unsureness about it, uncertainty about it, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of it. And we also have this yearning for it. Very, very deep in the heart is a sense that this is something that really is profoundly fulfilling to the heart. The heart's moving out in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, opening to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, opening to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of others is something almost without which a life cannot be fulfilled. And so deeply we yearn for it because of the connection that it sustains, that it opens with ourselves. Our own heart is deeply connected with its own depth. And the connection, of course, with others. And you may also be having a sense, you know, at times there's a real sweetness even in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. It's a very sweet quality. It can be, it should be, an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy" data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">energizing quality</a></span>, something of it that's actually sustaining, bright. It should also be - and this may or may not be the case, more or less, but - it should also be a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasant quality</a></span>. It's something that the heart can settle into, and actually enjoy <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Not a burden, not something to be scared of. The warmth of it, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> of it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Compassion should be an energizing pleasant quality" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Compassion should be an energizing pleasant quality" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
And again, going way back to, I think, something I said in the opening talk, that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nobility" data-href="Nobility" class="internal-link">ennobling quality</a></span>. It really gives a kind of beautiful <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nobility" class="internal-link">nobility</a></span> to the heart. And this is something which we can be genuinely proud of, our aspiration towards <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Perhaps on another level, too, it dissolves the kind of prison of self-interest that is our typical dwelling place. And this, again, is something that we're ambivalent about. So again, oftentimes spiritual practitioners feel the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="constriction" class="internal-link">constriction</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, and that as a prison, and yearn to be free, and yet, "Whoa! Maybe not so fast." It can be a little bit disorienting, or we're actually not sure how much we want to let go of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>-interest<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Its an ennobling quality" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#It's an ennobling quality" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
But through the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice, it's moving that way, through the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span> that come from the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, through the kind of sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> that sometimes opens up there. And slowly, over time, I really think we begin to sense that we cannot be fulfilled, we cannot actually find a really deep <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> in life if we're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-centred</a></span>. From the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> of self, to go out in the world searching for <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, is doomed to failure, is doomed to limitation, is doomed to actually create <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. And as these practices mature, I think, I would say there comes a point for people when one just says, "Actually, you know, I'm just not interested in living a life with self at the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> any more." It's just something has either gradually or suddenly just snapped. And that kind of life with self at the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> is no longer that interesting<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > We cannot find a really deep happiness in life if were self-centred" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#We cannot find a really deep happiness in life if we're self-centred" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
All this happens gradually, but there's a deeper and deeper commitment to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And as I think John said, maybe in the opening talk, you know, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dalai Lama" class="internal-link">Dalai Lama</a></span>, someone with tremendous years of practice and commitment says, "My religion is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>." It's just moved to that kind of place<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Gradually theres a deepening commitment to love and compassion" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Gradually there's a deepening commitment to love and compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 2-5
For the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>, one of the really important things in his own search, in his own practice, and also what he tried to encourage others, was asking the right questions of ourselves, of life, of practice. We may think, "Okay, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. All right. I see it's a good idea. How does it develop in my life?" So this asking the questions. How can I develop <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>? How does the heart open more in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>? Asking these questions - really, really important in life<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > How can I develop compassion" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#How can I develop compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-5
###### 3-1
There's a story about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Gertrude Stein" class="internal-link">Gertrude Stein</a></span>, the writer. I know very little about her, but she was on her deathbed, in and out of a coma, and surrounded by a sort of group of acolytes - is that the word? Devotees, almost. And she seemed to sort of be slipping into this coma and entering the other realms or whatever, and then sort of coming back to this realm a little bit, in and out like this over a few days. At one point, one of her little entourage, whose name, I think, was Nancy something, said, "Gertrude, Gertrude, what's the answer?" Because it seemed like she was going to some place. So when she sort of emerged from her coma-esque state, she said, "Nancy, what's the question?"^[Cf. James R. Mellow, _Charmed Circle: Gertrude Stein and Company_ (New York: Praeger, 1974), 468.] [laughter] Which I think - well, she was an odd fish anyway<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Gertrude Stein Whats the question" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Gertrude Stein What's the question" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
But in a way, there was some real <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span> in that, because sometimes we have the sense of wanting answers, wanting answers in life, and yet we're not asking very specific questions. If you look back on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s search, something he was extremely skilful at was asking really particular questions of himself and of others. And when he got asked questions, after his <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>, when he got asked questions that he felt actually weren't really leading anywhere, well, he wouldn't hesitate to tell the person! [laughter] If it wasn't the greatest question, maybe they should rethink their question, or sometimes he would just ignore it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Sometimes we want answers in life but were not asking very specific questions" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Sometimes we want answers in life but we're not asking very specific questions" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
So questioning is very important in our practice. And of course, we're dealing very much with the techniques here. And mostly the technique that we're working with is the phrases, and that's fine. That's one option. But there are many techniques. You know, if we just talk in terms of techniques, there are many techniques for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. There's _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="tonglen" class="internal-link">tonglen</a></span>_, some of you will be familiar with from the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tibetan Buddhism" data-href="Tibetan Buddhism" class="internal-link">Tibetan tradition</a></span>. There's the taking of a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a></span>, so <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Avalokiteśvara</a></span>, or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Kuan Yin</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tara" data-href="Tara" class="internal-link">Tārā</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">Jesus</a></span>, whatever it is, and just opening to that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, and channelling that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>. Beautiful way of practising. There is the use of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, what I talked about a little bit the other day: using the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> to just, in all kinds of different ways, to open up the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. But the development of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> in our life is, of course, not just a formal thing. And we have to ask: "Okay, I'm beginning to understand the techniques. This is working for me. What else in my life, so that it can really be a deep current in our lives?" A question: "What is it that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nurtures</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>? What is it that allows it to grow in the heart?" A hugely important question for our life<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Different practices for compassion" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Different practices for compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3
###### 3-4
So we may look, and the first thing, the sort of basis, in a way, is just a willingness to open to and to touch <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. It's that simple. If we're out of contact, if we're not looking, if we're disconnected from the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world, there's no way <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is going to arise, either for ourselves or for others. So it has this willingness to come close, to be intimate, to witness, to see, to feel. And that much may be obvious to people who have been practising a while, but I don't think that if we walk down Newton Abbot high street and took a survey and asked people, "Do you think it's a really good idea to open and to really <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> intimately the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world, your own or others'?", I'm not sure. [laughter] I'm not sure what the survey … So it's not obvious! [laughter] And even if we've been in these kind of circles, we need reminding. That's the thing without which <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> cannot arise, that willingness to come close and to touch<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > It has this willingness to come close" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#It has this willingness to come close" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-4

And in so doing in our practice, we begin to develop a confidence that we actually _can_ open to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, we _can_ be intimate with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, we _can_ look it in the face, and we can be okay. There's a confidence that comes into the heart, and that's huge. That's really huge. Because probably the reason that - I keep knocking Newton Abbot; it's probably the same - well, I don't know if it's the same in Totnes. Wherever. [laughter] I lost my track of thought. [laughter] Anyway, we develop the confidence by doing this, which is huge, because that's the one thing that would be lacking, I think, without the practice<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > With practice we develop a confidence that we can open to suffering" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#With practice we develop a confidence that we can open to suffering" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-1

So this willingness. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a></span>. '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a></span>,' meaning, again, how is it that human begins kind of create or co-create <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>? What are we doing that creates unnecessary <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world, for ourselves and for others? That's what <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> is - it's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> how <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is created, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> it so deeply that we don't do it any more. When there's that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, when there's that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> comes automatically. Because we look around us and inside us, and we just see it's going on all the time through <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, through <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span>, through misunderstanding. And with that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> comes <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. As the deepening of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>, of this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of self, as that deepens, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is natural: less to protect, less barriers between you and me, less barriers between me and the world. A natural sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">non-separation</a></span>.

Also the importance of - the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> talks a lot about association with the wise in order to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span>; as well as practice, just hanging out with people who are wise, talking with them, being with them, seeing how they live. I would add to that, association with the compassionate. Like really spending time with people who are really devoted to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, to service in the world. It kind of has a way of rubbing off. So a willingness to open, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>, action. I haven't said that one yet: action, meaning actually doing stuff. We meditate, and hopefully we're transforming our intentions, we're transforming our hearts, so that spontaneously it wants to pour out into the world, it wants to pour its <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> out into the world, it wants to hold the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. We're transforming the heart gradually, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a></span> the heart at very deep levels. And so the movement is from inner to outer. But not to underestimate the movement from outer to inner. We act in the world out of service even when we're not feeling like it. We do something, we put ourselves in situations, and there are all kinds of opportunities in the world to spend some time devoted to service, to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And that somehow transforms the inner as well. So action and association<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Spending time with compassionate people and actually doing stuff" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Spending time with compassionate people and actually doing stuff" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-3

And the last one, right now at least, is some degree of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, I would say, or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span>, or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, or something like that, whatever word is okay for you. That when we feel a certain amount of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">buoyancy</a></span> it's much easier for the heart to move out, to be not preoccupied with self, not burdened by life.

So I have a friend, I think I mentioned the other day, and she really has an extraordinary capacity for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. She's just one of these people that has a natural huge heart. And she has in her, for all kinds of complicated reasons, she has a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> from periods of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="depression" class="internal-link">depression</a></span>. And when she's in that more folded-in place, her heart just closes down. I think she _wants_ to be available, but she can't. She just doesn't have those inner resources. So taking care of our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span>, is actually hugely important<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Example A friends heart closes down when shes depressed" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Example A friend's heart closes down when she's depressed" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-5

We might ask: what <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nurtures</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>? The flip-side of the same question: what actually blocks it? What's not helpful? What's kind of getting in the way a little bit? And so, remembering with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, we talked about the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Near enemy" data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemies</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a></span> being attached <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a></span> has four <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Near enemy" data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemies</a></span>. Four things, four qualities, that arise - as human beings, they will arise for us - they can _look_ like <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, they can be mistaken for <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, but they're not; they're kind of diversions. And again, not that they're wrong or that we want to judge them or that they shouldn't arise and we expect them not to arise. They're actually part of having a human heart, part of our humanity, part of the learning process. So really not to judge these when they arise, or shun them or anything. Actually to look into what the differences are. So they are - I'll go through them in a bit more detail - <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pity" class="internal-link">pity</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > 4 near enemies fear anger pity grief" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#4 near enemies fear anger pity grief" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1

So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. And oftentimes I've come across people practising <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and they kind of have this relationship of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> to it. Again, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that they will open to, and it will be burdensome, or that they will be drowning in sadness and drowning in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>. We <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> our own <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. You know, this is very clear to us. There's emotional <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> that we have or physical <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, and we have a response of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> to it. But that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> only compounds the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. It only adds to it. Now, we need to be very clear about this. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a></span> is actually not something very helpful in relationship to our own <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, for the most part. And then in relationship to the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of the world, we can feel like little old me is supposed to open up to the, I don't know, maybe infinite <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of the world, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Infinity" data-href="Infinity" class="internal-link">the infinite</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of beings.

So there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. And this is quite common. It's quite a seductive one, the way that we can see <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world and our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, what might be <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, actually gets diverted into a kind of righteous indignation or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> at what's going on. It's extremely common. We blame: "If it wasn't for them, if it wasn't for you, this wouldn't happen." Or we judge others that we see to be causing <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world. Or we judge our own <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>: "I shouldn't be <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, I'm so stupid!

And when I got to the difficult category, I had three people in the difficult category. And two of them were these two American politicians. It was quite challenging. [laughs] And just seeing the blame, the judgment, etc., come up, the righteous <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. But as I practised with it, actually beginning to take a little bit of a broader view and seeing that, okay, this particular politician was brought up in a certain environment, he had a certain family. I mean, his father … [laughter] You know, where he was sent to school, all of it. There's no way - not _no_ way, but it would be _extremely_ a tall order to ask him, having grown up in that environment, in that family, in that education system, the whole works, to somehow extricate himself from all that and have a whole different <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of seeing</a></span> the world. That's not to condone some of the stuff that's going on, but this is what I'm saying about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dependent origination" class="internal-link">dependent origination</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">causes and conditions</a></span>, actually seeing it. We tend to blame selves, and we don't see the bigger picture. Again, this web of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">causes and conditions</a></span> that comes together and makes someone see something a certain way, someone do something a certain way, someone say something<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Blame judgment rightenous anger" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Blame judgment rightenous anger" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-4

Really, really important when we see, when we're trying to be compassionate to those who are actually causing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world. The other part is also a reflection on <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a></span>. And this is not a kind of revenge thing. It's seeing that whoever it is that seems like they're causing <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, they are actually causing <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> for themselves. And I'm not talking about future lives and all that stuff. In this life, it may not seem that way, but by cultivating greed, by cultivating insensitivity, by cultivating <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-centredness</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-preoccupation</a></span>, they are actually contracting their heart. There's a very real limit to how much a heart caught up in all of that, acting from all of that, there's a very real limit to the amount of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">true peace</a></span>, true <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span>, true <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> that that heart can open to, despite what else comes their way. When we talk about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a></span>, it's not a revenge - we don't get behind it because, "Yeah! They're going to get it!" [laughter] It's really, can we use that as a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, as a doorway to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Karma" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Karma" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^6-1

The last two years that I lived in the States, I moved out of the sort of inner city thing to - I wanted a bit more greenery around me, so I moved to the suburb. And it turned out after I got there that - it was really nice, actually, but it turned out to kind of be a suburb of the American dream, so to speak. And so a lot of people had swimming pools. I didn't have a swimming pool. [laughs] A lot of people with swimming pools and cars and this. And a lot of the cars there were these SUVs, sports utility vehicles, you know, those big kind of … Do you know what I mean when I say SUV? Yeah, four-wheel drive, exactly. At that time in America, there was no emissions - they could have all kinds of pollutants in the exhaust, and there was no law against it, and they were also of course gas guzzlers, etc., like that. And I'd been quite involved with different environmental projects and movements and stuff<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Story SUVs owners in the US" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Story SUVs owners in the US" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-2

And so I would walk around my otherwise very nice neighbourhood, and enjoying the greenery and everything, but actually fuming at seeing all these SUVs, and really getting quite bothered by it. I went to my teacher, and I explained what was going on, and she said - my teacher <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Narayan Helen Liebenson" data-href="Narayan Helen Liebenson" class="internal-link">Narayan</a></span>, she said, "Give them, send them <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>." And then she said, "And not only that, wish them _more_ SUVs." [laughter] So I was like, "Hoo. Okay." So I left, and I could do the first part, I did the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, but I could not wish them more SUVs.

But what I think happened, something at a certain point shifted. Maybe it was from the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. And I began to see: most of these people were very nice. They were caring, considerate, friendly, etc. They just did not understand. They didn't understand. They just didn't see. They were uninformed. They just didn't make the connection. They were ignorant. One use of the word '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span>.' But that, I think what happened with the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> softening it was, seeing that instead of _them_ being ignorant, I was seeing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span> does not belong to anyone. Many instances when _I_ was ignorant, I _am_ ignorant, of course. And it's like, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span> is part of the human condition. And instead of belonging to them, it was just like, there is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span>, and it doesn't belong to self. And somehow in that, there was the ability to be more soft with it, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> could arise. I still thought that the SUVs were really a huge shame, and then, of course, you know, September 11th happened, and people not really even seeing the connection between the oil in the Gulf and all that stuff, but anyway<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Ignorance does not belong to anyone" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Ignorance does not belong to anyone" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-4

There's a difference - I don't know if this corresponds to dictionary definitions, but what I would call 'judgment' and '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">discernment</a></span>.' And the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> talks a lot about <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">discernment</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Discernment</a></span> meaning, what is it that's leading towards <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>? What is it that's leading towards the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span> of self and other? To me, you know, American - well, the world now; it's the same in London - all those SUVs, it's actually not leading to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">freedom from suffering</a></span>. It's not helpful. Judgment would be when <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> has wrapped itself around that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">discernment</a></span>, and says, "You" or "I," "_I'm_ different. _You're_ doing this." Self is wrapped around the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">discernment</a></span>, and it's come to be a thing about self, rather than just a thing about discerning what leads to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and what doesn't. So there can be <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">discernment</a></span> and still <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and that's really important<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Theres a difference between judgement and discernment" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#There's a difference between 'judgement' and 'discernment'" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-5

And so the third thing, when there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> - (1) <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">causes and conditions</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dependent origination" class="internal-link">dependent origination</a></span>; (2) seeing that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span> doesn't belong to self, that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span> is just <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span>; (3) third thing, what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> calls - it sounds a little strange - remaining percipient of the beautiful. Which means, basically, when we see difficult stuff going on, or someone acting to create <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, we're drawn into that, and that becomes all we see.

Okay, so there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. Oh, and actually, one more thing: when the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> has gone off into righteous <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> or we feel that kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> come in, it's actually painful for us. So sometimes this might happen in the course of your practice, if you're giving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to the difficult person. To take a moment and just give the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to oneself, recognizing there's some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> there. If I'm involved in judgment, if I'm involved in blame, in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, in all that, my heart is burning, my heart is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">contracted</a></span> and painful. Just to take a moment, and turn round, and feel that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, and touch it with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to oneself, and then to go out again<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > When feeling the pain of anger coming in remember to give compassion to yourself" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#When feeling the pain of anger coming in remember to give compassion to yourself" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-2

So it's important that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> doesn't come into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> too much. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a></span> wants to alleviate <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, but it's not that it wants to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">push it away</a></span> out of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> - and there really _is_ a difference, and to feel in our practice and our lives the difference between those two. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a></span> is not <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a></span> out of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>; rather, it's almost <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> _holds_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, it holds <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and then adds <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>.

Okay, so there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, as these <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Near enemy" data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemies</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pity" class="internal-link">pity</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Pity" class="internal-link">Pity</a></span>. And again, this can be, this can look, very similar, but you can feel it in the practice. You can actually feel it and see if you can play with it. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Pity" class="internal-link">Pity</a></span> towards others is when we're looking down at them: "Oh, poor you, down there <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, worldling!" [laughter] It creeps in, and sometimes in very subtle ways, you know: "Oh, that's not the sort of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> _I_ get involved in" or whatever. Sometimes it's barely a thought, but there's just a stance of kind of looking down<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Pity is a stance of looking down" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Pity is a stance of looking down" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-4
###### 7-5
You can see it also, interestingly, in ourselves. We can somehow get into self-<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pity" class="internal-link">pity</a></span>, and that's quite common. Maybe it's when we're comparing our state of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> with others, and we're sort of down. But to see that self-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pity" class="internal-link">pity</a></span> is something _disempowering_. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a></span> is something that's actually energizing and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span>, and moves towards the alleviation of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. Self-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pity" class="internal-link">pity</a></span> will just keep it cycling. It's disempowering. It actually _keeps_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> there. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a></span> to self and other is empowering and not debilitating. So in the practice, you can see: when has <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pity" class="internal-link">pity</a></span> crept in, and is there some way I can equalize things again<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Self-pity is disempowering" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Self-pity is disempowering" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^7-5

All the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Near enemy" data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemies</a></span>, what they have in common is that there's too much <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span> in the mix at that time. Whether it's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pity" class="internal-link">pity</a></span>, whatever, there's too much self, either my self or your self, their self. Too much <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">selfing</a></span> is going on. There's too much of that in the picture. Can we remedy that by beginning to see the commonality? See the commonality of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span>, of whatever it is. And so this happens as we're meditating, and sometimes we just need to make a little shift, see what's common, and it can help. So <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and it's something that we all have.

Last one is a little bit more complicated: <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>. If there's too much <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span> comes into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice - and it's quite common - we can feel overwhelmed. We can really feel tired and burdened, and the practice can become tiring and debilitating. It's a little bit complicated, because sometimes we touch on things and it's necessary to feel the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span> and to kind of release <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>. However, maybe just to add, sometimes to look into: how does <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span> sometimes spiral and feed itself? So <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>, even if it's a very real and necessary <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>, we actually feel quite tired afterwards; even if it's very real, I need to release this, there's a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="tiredness" class="internal-link">tiredness</a></span> to it. That low physical <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> can then actually set up the conditions for more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>, and it can just keep going like that, because the physical <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> has sunk. So just something to be aware of when we're working with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>. Some of it may be really necessary. Sometimes it might just be spiralling in an unnecessary way. For the practice of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, we don't want to be too much over in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span> all the time. For some, it's going to be inevitable and it's actually a beautiful thing, that the heart is touched by that. But you want it to be balanced<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Grief is complicated because it may be necessary but can also be draining" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Grief is complicated because it may be necessary but can also be draining" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-1
###### 8-2
That aspect of balance, we did talk about it the other day, and I'll just mention it again briefly, because it's really important. As we open to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, there's the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a></span>, there's the trembling of the heart, the quivering of the heart, the sorrow that we feel at that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world, the sadness that we feel. That's natural. If there's too much of that, we _will_ get tired and feel burdened, if we emphasize that too much in practice<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > If theres too much sadness we feel we will get tired and feel burdened" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#If there's too much sadness we feel we will get tired and feel burdened" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-2
###### 8-3
So we can be aware, as the practice is going on, of where the balance is. And you can just lean over a little bit more to feeling the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> that's more going out to heal, to soothe, to comfort. That has a kind of brightness to it. It has a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> quality that's touching ourselves on its way out. And it will give the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, the heart, some <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">buoyancy</a></span> and some sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>. And it's really, really necessary. So that the practice of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> can be really sustainable. It doesn't feel like, "Ugh. I'm exhausted now. Can we move on to the next brahmavihāra?" It actually feels like one could just keep going with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, because it feels very lovely. And one can keep leaning the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> into feeling that loveliness, that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span> of that, and feeling it in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> as well. This is really, really important. And it's not a fixed point of balance that we find; it's always going to be moving. But it's something that we can be responsive to<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Find a dynamic balance with well-being and happiness" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Find a dynamic balance with well-being and happiness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-3
###### 8-4
As the practice of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> deepens - so we're working with this balance, and we're <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span>, we're sensitive to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and we're radiating out the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> - as it deepens, sometimes there's a possibility it deepens to, in a way, a third aspect. Not just the empathizing and the giving out, but a third aspect of what I would call '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span>,' or '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>' comes in, or a kind of 'holding' comes in. Sometimes it can be there really is a sense of space [that] opens up in the practice of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And it's almost as if that space - the space of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, or could call it the space of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, or just the space of the universe, whatever you want to call it - somehow feels like it effortlessly and organically holds whatever <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> arises. The space feels like it's infinitely vast, and it's just there, just present. All the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that has arisen, that ever has arisen, all the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that ever will arise, all the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that is, is accommodated in that space<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Spaciousness is holding whatever suffering arises" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Spaciousness is holding whatever suffering arises" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-4
###### 9-1
And at this point, if the practice - and again, not to grasp at any of this - but if the practice deepens to that level, it's kind of like <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> has gone out of it at that point. It no longer feels like I'm sitting here _doing_ the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice, I'm _giving_ the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> is cranking it and out comes the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. It's more like there's a sitting back and allowing the space to hold the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, effortlessly. And that too, of course, takes away from the sense of burden - I mean, _radically_ takes away from the sense of burden that we have, or overwhelm or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="tiredness" class="internal-link">tiredness</a></span>. It's not <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> doing it.

And sometimes the practice can just, by itself, just open up to that other space. It's a possibility.

Okay, now the other morning, I talked briefly about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to oneself. And again, just reflecting how common it is for us to feel, "Well, there's so much <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world, and I really don't suffer much compared to - I open the newspaper, and I see what's going on wherever it is, in Sudan or wherever." But it's hugely important to give the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to oneself, and it's not building ego. You might think, "Well, I'm spending all this time giving to myself. Isn't that just pumping up my ego in some way?" Ego gets pumped up through the _wrong_ kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to oneself, actually through _lack_ of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love" data-href="Love" class="internal-link">self-love</a></span>. When there's the lack of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love" data-href="Love" class="internal-link">self-love</a></span>, then the ego has to go out and make itself big in the world, and make itself this or that. When there's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> for oneself, the ego can just take its rightful place in the scheme of things. And it's tremendously <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span>, just that simplicity of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice to ourself. How <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> that is to bathe ourselves, our lives, our bodies, our minds, in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > When theres metta and compassion for oneself the ego can take its rightful place in the scheme of things" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#When there's metta and compassion for oneself the ego can take its rightful place in the scheme of things" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-3

And then, as I mentioned briefly the other day, and just to mention them briefly, possibilities of other, sort of more _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>_ openings through <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to oneself. When we're doing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to oneself, and there's not a particularly strong <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> there - so not when there's really a lot of something difficult going on; one's just going about in one's usual, humdrum meditative day. [laughter] And there's nothing particularly dramatic going on. I'm in the here and now, giving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to myself, and I'm just not too absorbed in the feeling of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. So it's _there_, maybe, or just the phrases are there, or whatever, but there's a little bit more wideness to include what I see, and the sounds, and what I'm feeling emotionally, and the thoughts and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a></span>. Just a little bit more wideness. There's a climate of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and some degree of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, which may mean that the phrases have got very sparse, or not using the phrases, or it's just one word or whatever<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Cultivating a climate of compassion" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Cultivating a climate of compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-4
###### 9-5
In that climate of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, with a little bit more broad <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, it's like a lens of looking at the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="present moment" class="internal-link">present moment</a></span>, the present <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, through the lens of seeing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">end of suffering</a></span>, in the moment. So we begin to see little sufferings, little ways that we're creating <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. And organically somehow, because of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice, we can just unhook. It just unhooks. _We_ don't really need to do it; it's just organically unhooked. You _may_ find this. You may find it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Looking at the present experience through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Looking at the present experience through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-5
###### 10-1
We become conscious of what we're <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to in the moment. And it could be, "Oh, when is this walking period going to end?" It could be we actually feel ourselves, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, move out of the here and now, and we feel with it the kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> and the subtle <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of that, in the climate of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. And it just, "May you be free." And we realize where the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> is. It's _not_ from moving out of the here and now. And we let go of that impulse. Or we may just realize the heart is closed down a bit, and that's not where the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> is, that's not where the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> is. And it's almost like we're not really thinking about it. It's just happening. And the heart can open again when we see it. There can be a natural <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> there. Or something we're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> at, or we're aware of how we're building things with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-story</a></span>. So there's actually some <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and then we're piling on, you know, decades of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span> and decades of future, and mother and father and grandparents and everything. It's all piled on there, and suddenly we've got this huge conglomerate of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. And we're actually seeing that in the moment: "Oh, this is what I'm doing." And I'm saying, "May you be free," and we see the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> is actually just to let go of that, and just to be with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> - which is probably considerably less than this whole mass of built-up stuff<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > We feel the contraction in the climate of compassion" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#We feel the contraction in the climate of compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-1
###### 10-2
But it could be any level of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. So, you know, it could be one's been working with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> a lot, and one sees: "Oh, I've just, I've moved back into making things seem really real. I'm out of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>." Or "I'm giving things solidity in time." Whatever it is. Doesn't matter. This way of practising can have a way of, I feel, kind of consolidating whatever <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> feels fresh. So we feel like, you know, you're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span>, and I'm <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> this or that about how <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> gets created, and this way of practising can actually keep it being used, keep it active, keep it fresh, consolidate it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Giving compassion to oneself can consolidate any insight practice" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Giving compassion to oneself can consolidate any insight practice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-2
###### 10-3
So that's one possibility, and you don't have to go anywhere near that if you don't feel like it, but I'm just putting it out there. And the second one that I mentioned the other day was also: <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to self, there's some degree of calming that happens, and in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span> there's a little more sense of just inner space. And I begin to see - don't even ask - "Who is this self I'm giving the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to?" And I just see <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> moments of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. A moment of an emotion, a moment of a thought, a moment of a sight, a moment of a feeling, a moment of whatever it is - <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, a moment of ease. That's all I can find, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> moments. I actually can't find anything else<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Seeing mind moments of experience" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Seeing mind moments of experience" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-3
###### 10-4
And so the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice, as it calms, can begin to feel like I'm just actually giving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to these <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> moments. There's nothing else there. There's a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> moment, and it's being touched with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. So this really does begin to free up the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, and free up the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> with it. Less <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And then we can take that level of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> and actually do it the same with others. I see there's nothing _here_ but <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> moments, nothing _there_ but <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> moments. We give <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to someone else and, again, the calming, we see: "I'm just giving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to their <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> moments" - in a way, their _ownerless_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> moments. There's no owner. They're just <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> moments arising. Can give a real sense of softness and space, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, too, in the practice. This is bringing the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span> in<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Giving compassion to mind moments" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Giving compassion to mind moments" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-4

So like I said, these are just two options, and really not to worry if they're not - if you're not including them, they're just options. Really not a big deal. Sometimes when we are <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> - in fact, a lot of the time - we tend to regard it as _my_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. _My_ loneliness, _my_ heartache, _my_ tummy ache, _my_ confusion, _my_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>, _my_ sadness, _my_ loss, _my_, _my._ And although we know it intellectually, we actually lose sight in the moment that my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is not different than the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of others. It's really not different<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > My suffering is not different than the suffering of others" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#My suffering is not different than the suffering of others" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-5

So I remember being in a class with my teacher, and one of the exercises we had as a homework one week was: whenever <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> comes up, especially in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>, seeing if you can reflect for a moment, "Someone somewhere is either going through this exact same thing right now or has." And actually bring that as a conscious reflection into the being with the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. Can have quite a strong effect. When we begin to see the humanity - our <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> kind of is human <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> - it can begin to soften, it can begin to open, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> for ourselves can begin to come in. Oftentimes with our own <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, we're actually adding to the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> by sort of adding an extra layer of isolation, and we don't even realize that we're doing it.

We've opened up to all the categories now, or you can take them in order or whatever you like. But sometimes when we're in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice, we notice, "Well, I'm giving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to this person. They actually don't seem to have much <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in their life, and there's really not much there." That's valid, and we don't need to kind of imagine scenarios for them or imagine that they're sitting on some repressed volcano of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that needs to come up from their unconscious. You know, it may be the case, but … [laughter] The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice doesn't need that. When there's no obvious <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, we can just bring to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> a kind of sensitivity, a quietening, a sensitivity. Bring to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> that it's not easy being human. It's not easy just being alive. We share a kind of vulnerability. We share uncertainty. We share the challenges of being alive. We don't need to create <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> for someone. Or just to admit: I actually don't _know_ what <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> you have in your life, what <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> you have had. I don't know what <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is going on right now, maybe that I'm completely unaware of. I don't know what will befall you in the future.

Again, bringing in this commonality, this sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>. So you can actually reflect in the practice: you know, we _are_ one, we are one in all kinds of ways. At a very mystical level, certainly we are one. But in the level that we're all vulnerable, we have bodies that are vulnerable to injury, to sickness, to decay, ageing, to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>. Just to reflect that we share that; really bring it in in a conscious way, as a way of supporting the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Seeing the commonality, seeing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>. And yeah, we share <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>. We share, as I said, an uncertainty, that life really _is_ uncertain. And I'm sure we all know people that - or maybe ourselves - that some news or some thing has happened, and the life has been changed dramatically from one moment to the next, and we didn't know that was going to happen that morning. This is what it is to be alive, and to be in the field of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Infinity" data-href="Infinity" class="internal-link">the infinite</a></span> web, in the field of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dependent origination" class="internal-link">dependent origination</a></span>: that we live in an uncertain world that can change, and change dramatically, suddenly<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Seeing the oneness in the commonality" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Seeing the oneness in the commonality" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-3

We're also one in that we share a kind of bewilderment with all of this.

And we share that until we're completely awakened. We share that, share that misunderstanding of life, of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and also of what it is that _really_ leads to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>.

If we reflect on this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, the science tells us all of us in this room share molecules that make up whatever it is, our nails and teeth and skin and all the complex functioning of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>.

[laughter] And as someone told me, right now, there's something like a 99.9 per cent probability that your next <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> contains air molecules from the dying <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">Jesus</a></span> on the cross.

###### 13-8
Yogi: I was sort of reflecting that, in a sense, the sort of enemies of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> are more problematic when one's working, one's giving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to oneself rather than to someone else or the universe. Because, in a sense, there's more attachment, you know, to what comes up. And I was wondering if we could perhaps explore that a little bit more. Because, in a sense, I see the value in giving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to myself, but the possibility of then getting caught up in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span> or sadness or whatever when things are seen … ^13-8
###### 13-9
Rob: Yeah, it's true. I think that would be quite a common pattern to get more caught up inside. But not everyone. People are different in their patterns. Some people get more caught up with, "Everyone else is wrong, and I'm okay." So this is important. Firstly, I like to encourage people to give quite a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to themselves because of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> involved, but also because it really does open up as a very deep avenue of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, as well, into one's own <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">particular patterns</a></span> and how one gets caught. So there's that. So yeah, by all means, spend a lot of time on <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to yourself if you feel drawn that way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Rob Giving compassion to oneself is important for healing and insight" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Rob Giving compassion to oneself is important for healing and insight" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-9
###### 14-1
Going back to what I was saying about this balance between empathizing and the sort of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> or the kind of feeling the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span> going out: if one's taking care of that balance, one will also take care of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> involved. Because you're tuning into what's nice, there will be loveliness to what's going on, in some quiet way, and there will be a settledness there. In that settledness, part of the result of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> will be less tendency to create problems. That's what goes with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. But also when there _are_ problems, to see them more clearly and more spaciously<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Because of the well-being involved that also supports samadhi" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Because of the well-being involved that also supports samadhi" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-1
###### 14-2
So if you're practising <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> with the right kind of balance, it's good - you're actually opening up to the kind of things you would do in your life anyway, but seeing them more spaciously, more clearly, because they're less … And as I said with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Near enemy" data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemies</a></span>, not to think they shouldn't come up; actually they _do_ come up. They _will_ come up. It's human, and if we can just include that as part of the practice, this is very much in the field of what developing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> _is_: actually looking at what's not quite <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and being willing to discern the difference and practise with it. So they're not problems to shoo out the door too quickly, necessarily<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Near enemies will come up thats human" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Near enemies will come up that's human" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-2
###### 14-3
Yogi: Yeah. I suppose one of the things that … keeping that balance, as well, seems more difficult when working with oneself. That would be another thing that I'd be including in that question. And so in a sense there's also the issue of, if one has got caught, what would you recommend - to move to practising <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to others, or maybe work in a more open way? What would you suggest<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Yogi What to do when one is caught in attachment" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Yogi What to do when one is caught in attachment" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^14-3
###### 14-4
Rob: Anything really. Sometimes you can just shift the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a></span>. Like you notice, say you're blaming yourself for some <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that arises, then actually seeing, taking a moment in the practice to reflect: it wasn't self's fault. It was all the conditions, and the past conditioning, and the present, and the situation, outer and inner, that actually led or are leading to what's happening. And just taking a moment to reflect, that can soften it, and then you can, in that softening, take up the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> again. That might be one possibility. Sometimes it's skilful to actually go and work with someone else for a while and then come back. Sometimes you might want to open up the practice, as I know you do, and just open that and get that kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> there, and then come back. If you can stay within the practice, if you decide I'm doing regular <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice and I'm within that, you can just kind of move to a sense of seeing the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">causes and conditions</a></span> a bit more widely. And then the softening, and then coming back. That might be preferable.

I mean, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Near enemy" data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemies</a></span> _will_ come up, and they're to be worked with - to be seen, to be understood, to be worked with.

**Q2: compassionate action and attachment** ^14-7
###### 15-1
Yogi: I wonder a lot about action that is born out of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. I can be in that space feeling very compassionate toward <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world, and quite equanimous and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a></span> with it. But then when the question of action comes in, and this big thing in my life, actually, that's where the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> goes. Because how can you have action without attachment to results? Because if you're not attached to results, then how can you be motivated for the action? If you _are_ attached to the results, that is when it becomes overwhelming<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Yogi How can you have action without attachment to results" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Yogi How can you have action without attachment to results" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-1
###### 15-2
Rob: Yeah, sure. Again, it's not that we find one static place with all this, and it's like, "Okay, sorted out my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. It's all kind of fixed there." It's more that the whole thing is going to be shifting. So in our practice it's going to be shifting, and in the world it's going to be shifting. Sometimes we decide we want to do something to help, to be of service, and there _is_ attachment there. Sometimes we're aware of the attachment, sometimes not. But I would say, don't _not_ act just because there's attachment there. It's more like over probably years of practice, one learns to practise with there being attachment there, and kind of softening the attachment, going back and forth, softening the attachment but still working or whatever. So the presence of attachment, it shouldn't hinder one from acting. One acts anyway, and then the attachment is in one's field of practice at that point<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Rob In our practice its going to be shifting and in the world as well" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Rob In our practice it's going to be shifting and in the world as well" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-2
###### 15-3
It might be that then one's acting, and it moves between quite attached and then having to be quiet and regain and find less attachment. Even the less attachment, one can say, "Well, I want to do something to help." Less attachment doesn't necessarily mean indifference; there's also _that_ that might come up. It's actually moving between attachment and indifference, can be. All of this is going to happen. And in a way, it's just like saying, "Okay, I'm going to act. I know it's all going to come up, and I'm going to practise with it as it comes up." At a very deep level, I actually feel that it _is_ possible to act in the world, to want to help <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, realizing that it's all <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">completely empty</a></span>. There's no me doing it. There's no person receiving it. There's no action. There's not even any <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in a _real_ sense. It's all <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">completely empty</a></span>. And yet what should come out of seeing that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> is the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> to act. Seems paradoxical. In terms of one's practice it will move, and then it's a question of practising with that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Less attachment doesnt necessarily mean indifference; its all empty" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Less attachment doesn't necessarily mean indifference; it's all empty" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-3
###### 15-4
Yogi: Yeah, I think I'm more concerned about keeping the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> in the action, rather than how to deal with it sitting on the cushion, how to keep the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, you know. It's just overwhelming. You try whatever, and there are more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span> than anything else<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Yogi How to keep the energy when it becomes overwhelming in the action" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Yogi How to keep the energy when it becomes overwhelming in the action" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-4

Rob: I think that what happens with these practices, and sometimes a lot of stuff that I've said today can sound completely abstract, you know - <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">no self</a></span>, no boundaries and everything. I think what happens is, after a while, it becomes something that's much more workable in a moment as we're moving through action, and more real. But, I don't know, that takes practice. It takes practice. Is there a particular - I mean, you don't have to say what it is, but is it a particular situation you're thinking of<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Rob No self can sound abstract but with practice it become more workable and more real in a moment of action" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Rob No self can sound abstract but with practice it become more workable and more real in a moment of action" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^16-3

###### 16-5
Rob: It's like my story of the SUV thing. It was coming up, but really trying to challenge it. Like saying, "It's not okay that I'm walking around like this with bad feeling and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">ill-will</a></span> and all of that. It's just not okay.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Like with the SUV story Ill-will is not ok" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Like with the SUV story Ill-will is not ok" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^16-5

Yogi: SUVs are still there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Yogi But SUVs are still there " data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Yogi But SUVs are still there " class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-6
###### 16-7
Rob: They are. But it's also like, first of all, I don't know what the emissions law on SUVs is now in America. But I think one can come to a point in practice where it feels like some of the stuff that we care about and move towards changing is actually not going to change in the world. For instance, like climate change. Who knows what's going to happen with that? But still, to be in the world with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, acting out of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is the best way to live. There's just no doubt about it. And we don't know what will happen. This is where the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> comes in - we actually are not completely in control of what will happen. Again, it's an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">infinite web of conditions</a></span>. It's not just in our control. Somehow, as <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> deepens, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> comes more and more into the practice. But even if something's not going to change, it's still that being in the world, viewing the world, and acting out of a place of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is just the best way to be. There's nothing that comes close to it. We can be angry or we can be indifferent or we can be selfish or whatever, but <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is the best. And we don't know what will happen. We'll be speaking more about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> a bit later in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. It's a hard one. It is a hard one. I really feel that we have to challenge it, though. In the moment, we have to challenge it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Rob We are not completely in control of what will happen but acting out of compassion is still the best way to live" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Rob We are not completely in control of what will happen but acting out of compassion is still the best way to live" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-7

**Q3: using <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> to connect with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> vs straight in** ^16-8
###### 16-9
Yogi: In the sessions, I'm mixing quite a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. What I understand is that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is born from <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. It's just <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> meeting <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. So I feel I need to connect with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> before being able to be in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> space. So in the sessions, there's quite a lot of time with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> before going to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Is that …<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Yogi I feel I need to connect with mettā before being able to be in the compassion space" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Yogi I feel I need to connect with mettā before being able to be in the compassion space" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^16-9
###### 16-10
Rob: What happens when you _don't_ do that? ^16-10
###### 17-1
Yogi: It just feels difficult to really connect with the feeling of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. ^17-1
###### 17-2
Rob: Okay. There are a couple of ways - it's fine. I think I would rather you could do just more straight <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> so you could be really clear about what the difference is. But it's fine if that goes on. You might want to just be aware of someone's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, kind of just sit with that, and see what the response is, and see what comes. Can be really skilful. Or, in the context of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, you're actually not getting so sucked in immediately to where the really strong <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is. So you're thinking of the friend or the benefactor, whatever it is, and you're just aware of their being, and the fact that they're human and everything, and there's a quality of - it's almost like <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, but you're just aware that life has <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in it, too, and then you're giving it, and then you can turn a bit more and include what might be more obvious <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. Does that make sense? But it's not too much of a big deal. If you can kind of whittle down the time spent on <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and make it more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, that would also be good. Just get more and more used to the feeling of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, so that you can cue into that more readily. Yeah? Was that your question? Okay<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Rob Be clear what the difference is; get more and more used to the feeling of compassion" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Rob Be clear what the difference is; get more and more used to the feeling of compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-2

**Q4: swapping and changing categories** ^17-3
###### 17-4
Yogi: With the categories, could you start to sort of swap and change now? Or is it more useful to just stay day by day<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Yogi start swapping or stay with one category each day" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Yogi start swapping or stay with one category each day" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^17-4
###### 17-5
Rob: You can swap and change as you like. I mean, I think John said yesterday, hopefully, that you've got _this_ much time to work through the categories. Did he say that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Rob You can swap and change as you like" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Rob You can swap and change as you like" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^17-5
###### 17-6
Yogi: That's actually just what I wasn't quite sure [?]. ^17-6
###### 17-7
Rob: _Ohh._ [laughs] ^17-7
###### 17-8
Yogi 2: Who are we working with today? ^17-8
###### 17-9
Rob: Sorry, maybe there was a misunderstanding there. Okay. ^17-9
###### 17-10
Yogi: It was a bit unclear. He sort of said both. ^17-10
###### 17-11
Rob: My <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> was that from yesterday the sort of message was, okay, until, on Sunday morning we're going to start another practice. So between yesterday and Sunday, you can go through all the categories at any pace or order or whatever that you like. And probably the usual order is better. But you can go through them. ^17-11
###### 17-12
Yogi: And what [?] at times if it feels right opening it up to all beings? ^17-12
###### 18-1
Rob: To all beings? ^18-1
###### 18-2
Yogi: Yeah. ^18-2
###### 18-3
Rob: No, not at all. Go for it if that feels more appropriate. And sometimes the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> does feel better, it feels there's more equality there with just openness and all beings, and do that. But do come back to particular beings as well. Is that clear<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Also to all beings but come back to particular beings as well" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Also to all beings but come back to particular beings as well" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^18-3
###### 18-4
Yogi 3: … overlapping with the categories. For instance, the person I've been using as difficult in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice was the first to come to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, the person who's obviously <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. ^18-4
###### 18-5
Rob: That's fine. Again, you want to take care of making the practice easy. If it feels like I'm not really connecting with anything here … ^18-5
###### 18-6
Yogi: That's why I'm asking, because that's what I've been doing, is overlapping and swapping. I can stay longer in that space. ^18-6
###### 18-7
Rob: Okay, that's fine. If it feels helpful, it's fine. It's just changing, doing that and then finding, "This is really hard work. This is not really happening." Then I would say it's not the wisest choice. ^18-7
###### 18-8
So again, if you go to all beings in the next few days, there are all those ways I said. You can just be in a space of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Just random <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> of beings or what you might have seen on the news or newspaper or whatever, or beings that you know or don't know may just come in and go, and come and go. But the space is quite important. Just a space radiating <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Sometimes it can feel like you're just resting in that space, and there's very little doing, very little phrases. It's just sort of not doing much; it's just a space of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. That can be very helpful. Sometimes, again to emphasize, to be as much as possible in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> with it. So it's almost like the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> becomes <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. It's just radiating out <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. You've become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Can happen sometimes<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > A space radiating compassion" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#A space radiating compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^18-8

###### 18-10
Yogi: … swapping the categories. The categories I use for practising <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> might not be as suitable as other people practising <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Yogi The other people category for practising mettā might not be suitable for practising compassion" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Yogi The other people category for practising mettā might not be suitable for practising compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^18-10
###### 18-11
Rob: Because there's not enough <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> there? ^18-11
###### 18-12
Yogi: Yeah. Or it's a bit strained to imagine [?] a newspaper story, a very sad situation that I could work with. ^18-12
###### 18-13
Rob: That's a really important question. Take maybe two or three people in the very obvious <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> category, so that might include this newspaper story. But I would say you actually want to keep the others in the other categories, because what we're moving to is a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> that's universal in the sense that it doesn't actually just restrict itself to very dramatic, obvious <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. It's actually something just, there's a sensitivity that develops that - it's just realizing how subtle <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> can be, and that's also something that we have <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> for. And it might be a very beneficial spiritual stretch to actually stretch and just begin seeing this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>, this commonality. That's actually a really good way of stretching the heart that way. But if you want to add maybe one or two more people to the obvious category, that's fine. Okay<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Rob realise how subtle suffering can be" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Rob realise how subtle suffering can be" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^18-13
