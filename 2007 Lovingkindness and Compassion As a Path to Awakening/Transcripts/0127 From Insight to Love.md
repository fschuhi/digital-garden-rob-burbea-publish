So through this practice, in this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, a number of things are going on, hopefully. And one is the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. We could say the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> of the heart, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> of a different way of being in the world. One could say that. And the development of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, the deepening of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> as a gift, as a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> for ourselves and for the world. And all the benefits that that brings, and all the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> that that brings. And we've talked also about the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, and the development of that and the benefits of that. And in this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> in particular, how <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> develops <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. How <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> itself and the development of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> leads to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. We'll be talking more about that. But in _this_ talk, what I want to go into a little bit is how <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span> can lead to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, how the process of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> can feed and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourish</a></span> the process of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. So <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> through <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > What is going on in this retreat here how insights can lead to love" data-href="From Insight to Love#What is going on in this retreat here how insights can lead to love" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1

It can seem at first that what we're doing in this practice is we're putting in lots of huff and puff, and building up some <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, creating some <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, creating <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. And in a sense, that's true. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Mettā</a></span> is a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>, it's true. All things are <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrications</a></span>, and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> is a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. But what can also seem to be the case - and it can move towards this becoming clearer - is that perhaps <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, is the natural state, the natural expression when the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> is not clouded by <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span>. When the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> is relaxed, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> is there, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is there and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is there. And as <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span>, as this misunderstanding of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of the world, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of things, as that begins to dissolve a little bit, in the moments when that's not there so strong, then the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is there as a natural state and a natural expression<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Metta is fabricated but its also the natural state" data-href="From Insight to Love#Metta is fabricated but it's also the natural state" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2
###### 1-3
When we talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, oftentimes we use this word, and we say '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a></span>,' and sometimes it's sort of, "I wonder what's actually meant there?" <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a></span>, to me, is that which releases <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. Okay? So there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, there's constricting ourselves around something inner or outer, pushing it away, pulling it towards us, holding on to it, struggling with it. And <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> brings with it <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a></span> is that which, either through intellectual <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, through reflection, just an intuitive sense, some very organic sense, at any level at all (fairly easy or superficial, right down to the depths of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>), releases that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and therefore releases <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. So that's what <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> is. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s enormously interested in this, and he's interested in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a></span> ourselves, our lives, the moment, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a></span> and relating, that bring this release. And with the release, with the release from <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, comes <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span> that bring a release of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and bring with that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Insight is that which releases clinging" data-href="From Insight to Love#Insight is that which releases clinging" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3
###### 1-4
And so what I want to go into a little bit is perhaps a possibility of incorporating some of that into the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice and the practice of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. So we can see in our lives (and hopefully this should get more and more clear as our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> deepens): when there is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, there's less <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. So a very obvious one is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a></span> is a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, it's a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="constriction" class="internal-link">constriction</a></span>. When that's around, it kind of blocks <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. It blocks our capacity to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, our capacity of openness of heart, of connection. And we can actually see that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> have a kind of inversely proportional relationship, as the mathematicians say: more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, kind of the less accessibility to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. And <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> has a way of actually dissolving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, can do. Conversely, we can see in ourselves, certainly, and in the world and in others, how much when there's a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, oftentimes there's a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> right there, a lot of violence right there, and we just have to open a newspaper to see a lot of that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Constrictions block our capacity to love" data-href="From Insight to Love#Constrictions block our capacity to love" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4

A little over a couple of years ago, I had the good fortune to meet someone in India. Not a spiritual person at all. He didn't regard himself that way, very sort of humanist person. I and some friends, about ten or twelve of us, had gone out to work at a leprosy community in Maharashtra in India, and spent about a month there. And met the guy who started this community. His name is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Baba Amte" class="internal-link">Baba Amte</a></span>. His story is quite remarkable, and it kind of illustrates this relationship between <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Baba Amte" data-href="From Insight to Love#Baba Amte" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1

He'd grown up very rich, one of these very wealthy Indian, almost aristocratic [families], and got a job as a lawyer at some point, and then met <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahatma Gandhi" data-href="Mahatma Gandhi" class="internal-link">Gandhi</a></span> when he was a young man. And somehow moved towards representing the disenfranchised in India. So he was, I think, living in Calcutta and representing the people, the workers who clean out the sewers in Calcutta. So you can kind of imagine what conditions they were living in, and was trying to represent them legally. And <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahatma Gandhi" data-href="Mahatma Gandhi" class="internal-link">Gandhi</a></span> said to him at one point, "If you want to understand someone, you have to step into their shoes for a while.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > If you want to understand someone you have to step into their shoes for a while" data-href="From Insight to Love#If you want to understand someone you have to step into their shoes for a while" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^2-2

So he took that, he took <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahatma Gandhi" data-href="Mahatma Gandhi" class="internal-link">Gandhi</a></span> at his words, and he got a job down there cleaning the sewers in Calcutta. You can imagine. He decided to do that for a year. And one day, he was coming home at night in the dark from a day's working in the sewers, and he tripped over something in the road. He looked down, and he saw that it was a man lying in the road, abandoned and dying of leprosy in its final stages. He saw this man there and was so horrified that he ran home. Immediate kind of knee-jerk response, and he ran to his home. And when he arrived home, kind of out of breath, he got there and then he realized, "Oh, what have I done?" And he sort of gathered himself, went back, found the man, picked him up, took him home, and nursed him in the days until he died, and was with him in that period<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Finding a dying man in the sewers of Calcutta" data-href="From Insight to Love#Finding a dying man in the sewers of Calcutta" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3

He had already seen this kind of relationship between <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, and the closing that can come with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. But he said that was really a turning point for him. So he gave up his job as a lawyer, and he somehow bent the ear of the Maharashtran government to give him a piece of desert scrubland. He and his wife and two baby boys, I think four lepers and a lame cow [laughter], this ragtaggle mob, went to this scrub piece of desert, basically, in Maharashtra. They started, mostly him, started to build this community. And that was, I think, in the early fifties. I went there a few years ago. And amazing what's been built there. Five thousand people or something live there. They're completely self-subsistent in many things. Beautiful place, a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> there. And remarkable to meet this man. I mean, this is kind of extraordinary, you know - most of us, we can only appreciate that. And to meet this man who consistently in his life had chosen <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> over <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, and that he was 92, and actually has not been able to walk or has not been able to stand up for, I don't know how many years, forty years or something. All he can do is walk a little and lie down. And just the presence that was there through a lifetime of keeping making the choice of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> over <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> over <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> over <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. Really extraordinary<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Maharashtra" data-href="From Insight to Love#Maharashtra" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 2-5
So I want to just, in a way, actually, now that I mention it, take a little bit of a tangent. Because some people have been saying that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> has been coming up in the practice, and anyway there's this relationship between <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. So I just want to say a little bit about working with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. As I mentioned, I think, in the talk on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, sometimes the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> feels like it's deepening and opening into kind of new states, new senses of openness, or depths. And sometimes, with that, a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> will come up. Some of the time, there are these two things kind of going on at once: there's a sense of the new space and the openness of that and maybe the loveliness of that, even, and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. And at the same time, they're there. If the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> isn't that strong - and sometimes there's no <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, but if the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> isn't that strong, it's possible not to ignore the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, but also just to kind of tip the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> over a little bit, tip the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> over a little bit to go into the loveliness. Just incline the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> to what's pleasant there, even if it's just very non-dramatically pleasant. Give the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> some sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a></span>, of something that it can trust there. Not <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a></span> the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> or ignoring it. It can be really skilful if that feels like it's going on in the practice. If it feels really strong, then it needs turning to and working with. And sometimes, of course, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> has nothing to do with the practice or whatever. So I just want to briefly go into working with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> a little bit<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Dont push away fear but incline the awareness a bit towards loveliness" data-href="From Insight to Love#Don't push away fear but incline the awareness a bit towards loveliness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-5
###### 3-1
So, often we run away from <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, we don't even stop to wait and investigate a little bit: what actually is this that I'm running away from? What actually is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>? If we go into it a little bit more clearly, can see: <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is, one way of breaking it down is, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> involves some unpleasant physical sensations - you know, the heart pounding, or the tummy butterflying or whatever - unpleasant physical sensations, and the reaction to them, their being unpleasant. Usually, not always, some thoughts, which are generally unpleasant, spinning around, and the reaction to them. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Body sensations</a></span>, unpleasant, and reaction; the thoughts, unpleasant, and the reaction. And then something a bit more subtle: a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="constriction" class="internal-link">constriction</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="constriction" class="internal-link">constriction</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>. It feels like <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> kind of shrinks down with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> and becomes very small. And we don't generally like having a small <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>; we enjoy more a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a></span> kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>. And so that constricting of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> is also experienced as unpleasant, and there will be a reaction to that, generally a reaction of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Fear involves unpleasant body sensations and a constriction of the mind" data-href="From Insight to Love#Fear involves unpleasant body sensations and a constriction of the mind" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
Not to be anal, but that kind of constellation is what makes up <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. And just to mention that, just to go into that in order to have ways in to work with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, so that we can get hold of a piece and begin working with it, rather than just being overwhelmed by this mass of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, which is often the case<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Piecemeal approach to working with fear" data-href="From Insight to Love#Piecemeal approach to working with fear" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
So what is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>? Beginning to get a handle on it. What is our relationship with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>? Generally, it's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, it's unpleasant and we flee it. We have <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. Now, this is very common. There's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> around, and we're actually afraid of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. It's so unpleasant that we're running away from it. In practice, we can begin working with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> in different ways so that we gradually learn to accommodate <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. And gradually, slowly, over time, learn to have a confidence with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, with the presence of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. This is one thing that's lacking. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a></span> comes up, and we're afraid of it, we don't feel confident with it. If it's possible to actually practise in a different way, even instead of trying to be so <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, practising complete - if possible, as complete as possible - a total <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span> of the physical sensations of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. So that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> feels like it's actually more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a></span> than the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> sensations can be there in a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, and they're just allowed, they're just allowed. They're welcomed, even. So this really is a practice<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Practice total acceptance of the physical sensations of fear" data-href="From Insight to Love#Practice total acceptance of the physical sensations of fear" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3

And over time one of the things that can develop is we really begin to feel like, it's just some unpleasant sensations. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a></span>, "I can accommodate this. I can accommodate this." And it's possible for the unpleasant sensations to be there without any <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="constriction" class="internal-link">constriction</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> or paralysis or freaking out or anything like that.

So usually the relationship, as I said, to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, and it's fleeing the unpleasant. That fleeing actually makes the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> increase. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> is not something neutral. This is really important. So our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> to things is not a neutral element. When we flee <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, which is understandable, but when we flee it, when we're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">averse to it</a></span>, it actually makes the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> increase.

This fleeing, this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, is part of the constellation of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. When we flee the physical sensations, where do we flee to? We don't like the physical sensations, where do we go? We go straight up into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, which is already spinning with thoughts. And that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> goes into the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, into the thinking, and just adds to the kind of whirlwind up there. The thoughts spiral. They're generally not helpful anyway at that point, and we get an increase in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > When we flee we go straight up into the mind" data-href="From Insight to Love#When we flee we go straight up into the mind" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-2

This reaction to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span>, the reaction to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span> is actually _part of_ the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span> itself. It's not that there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span>, and now I have whatever reaction to it. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, the fleeing of it, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> to it, is actually part of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> itself. They're not two separate things. If I can learn through practice to really welcome the sensations of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, I'm actually taking away that reaction of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, and I'll see, through practice, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> cannot support itself. It cannot support itself without my reaction of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>. It cannot. And not to take my word for it - to see in one's own practice: <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> needs my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of it. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a></span> needs my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> to it.

###### 4-4
So, to see, when <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is around, because it's very normal, it's very human: am I putting a pressure on it? Am I pushing it away? A pressure for it to be different? Am I judging myself that it's around? "Boy, I'm really going backward now. I'm a crappy meditator, should probably just leave these good people to get on with it and go home." What am I telling myself? What am I concluding about the presence of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>? That judging of myself is putting a pressure on, and that pressure is another factor that will build the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. It's another factor that adds fuel to the fire of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. What am I thinking, what am I believing it says about me, that there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Judging of myself adds fuel to the fire of fear" data-href="From Insight to Love#Judging of myself adds fuel to the fire of fear" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^4-4

So rather, can we actually shift and see the humanity of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>? That it's such a human thing to have <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, it's actually built into our - I don't know, genetic make-up or whatever. It's built into our biology. It's very human. It's true that a lot of it is unhelpful and irrelevant. But the actual mechanism of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is very human. Can we actually just open to the fact of the humanity of it? And bring some <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span> to ourselves, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> to oneself. At that moment when I have <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, I'm giving <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> to myself, who is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> right now?

On a sort of larger scale, you know, we think about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> in our lives, and how much of it is actually unnecessary and irrelevant and really not helpful, really just getting in the way. And think how much <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is there because of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a></span>, worrying about the future: will I be okay? Will this happen? Will that _not_ happen? Whatever. A huge, really deep part of practice is actually asking ourselves, "I'm worried about the future. I notice <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of the future. Do I actually know, genuinely, how to take care of the future, what that really, really, really means, to take care of the future? What is it that leads to our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, really, _really_?<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Fear of how to take care of the future" data-href="From Insight to Love#Fear of how to take care of the future" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^4-6
###### 4-7
To really understand what leads to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, what takes care of the future, to understand that deeply, not just intellectually, in the cells, in the bones, that's, to me, a sign of very mature practice. So, you know, we're inundated with all this advertising, or you need this, you need that. And just the basic things which most of us take for granted, or even want a nice house, or a nice relationship, a nice career and this and that. And just to really understand, _really_, what is it that leads to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, what is it that leads to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span>? The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> puts enormous emphasis on this question, really <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> and really living this question: what is it that leads to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span>? So all the things that we can get off track with that - what other people think of me, or, you know, it's endless. What other people think of me does not lead to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span>, cannot lead to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span>. No way.

So what _does_ lead to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>? How _do_ we take care of the future? And the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> talks about this. It's through the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a></span> of those beautiful qualities of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and heart. They will be our treasure, our fruit, throughout our life and at our deathbed. So what we're doing here, building <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> as <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and the heart, this is the real treasure. And you know, all the other lists, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, and this and that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Its the cultivation of beautiful qualities of mind and heart" data-href="From Insight to Love#It's the cultivation of beautiful qualities of mind and heart" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1
###### 5-2
<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a></span> will take care of the future, and also in relationship to the present. We worry about the future, but if the relationship to the present is okay, is open, interested, present, alive, caring, then the future tends to take care of itself. And as I say, I really do think it's a sign of real maturity in practice to really know that and live that. It's quite rare. There's so much else that can distract us and pull us into, "No, I need this. This is what I need. This is the security I need. This is what I need to take care of." So it's really, really some maturity in practice to be clear about this. And it can move to a place where there's just much much less worry about, "Will I be secure when I get old? Will there be enough money? Will I be alone? Will my partner leave? Will they die? Will this, that, that, that, that?<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Cultivation will take care of the future also in relationship to the present" data-href="From Insight to Love#Cultivation will take care of the future also in relationship to the present" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^5-2

We can incorporate it and kind of use it as something that feeds and nourishes the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> in a way as a sort of background to the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice, can bring it in. So when we open up this door, how <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> feeds <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, it's actually huge. The possibilities are, don't know if they're endless, but there's a ton in there. So I just want to draw out maybe three possibilities, and talk a little bit about this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>, what John talked about the other day and what we're mentioning quite a lot: this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>, this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of self, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">no-self</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > 3 possibilities + anatta" data-href="From Insight to Love#3 possibilities + anatta" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-4

And there's a kind of, at times, and not to grasp at this, at times, through the practice, through the deepening of the practice, there's a kind of dissolution and a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> that comes in. And there's just a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>. Self and other, instead of that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a></span> there's a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> there. And this is hugely valuable to the practice. I mean, it's a really beautiful thing for the heart to be able to have a sense of and open to, at times. It's not that we will _live_ in a state of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>, because that's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span> too<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Metta practice can lead to the dissolving of the boundaries between self and other" data-href="From Insight to Love#Metta practice can lead to the dissolving of the boundaries between self and other" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-5

They're <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>.

So I'll go through each, and there are also ways - perhaps for us the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span> one is particularly interesting. I'll go through each, and they all, in a way, can lead to the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span> one. I'll explain what I mean. I should actually say right now: I'm outlining some of the possibilities for practice. So if you're listening and you think, "_Pfff_," you know, that's completely fine. The basic practice, what we're doing, there are no problems with that. You don't have to go complicating it if it feels like this is a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">complication</a></span>, or if you're feeling like "I'm not doing it right" or anything like that. What I'm really doing is just offering some possibilities. And in a way, for some people, they will be workable because of previous practice or whatever. For others, it will just be a sense of possibilities for the future; possibilities, maybe a sense of how deep this practice of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> can actually go, the levels to which it can be taken. I feel like it's important to put out what the possibilities of practice are, even if they don't feel realizable and accessible for me right now, just so that we don't diminish what the possibilities of practice are. So if you're listening and it just feels like, "Interesting, but no, thank you. Forget it," that's completely fine. But also to feel free maybe sometimes to experiment with some of this<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Im just offering some possibilities" data-href="From Insight to Love#I'm just offering some possibilities" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-4

**(1)** So, first one: **<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>**. All of these, there are many ways to go about them. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a></span>. One level of meaning is contemplating, being aware of, remembering, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> and the context of our life being so short in the context of the universe and the spans of the universe. So remembering <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>. Just an aside, but the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> was saying, "Monks, you should remember <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>" or whatever, and one monk said, "Every day I remember <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>," and he said, "Very good, but not good enough." [laughter] And then another monk said, I don't know, "Every morning and evening I remember <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>." He said, "Very good, but not good enough," and so it went on. And a monk said, I don't know, "Every time I walk somewhere I remember <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>." And another monk said, "Every time I exhale I remember <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>." "Good, very good, but not good enough." And then a monk said, "Every time I inhale and every time I exhale I remember <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>." And the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> said, "Very good." [laughter] ^6-5
###### 7-1
What it's pointing to is wearing some lenses that lead to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>, through which we look at life. This is what is interesting. It's not just something that, "Oh, yeah, I remember this thing we're supposed to think about, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, occasionally." It's actually looking at the current moment through the lens of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>. So one meaning of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> and what I might call vastnesses of time. I think the universe is 13.7 billion years old, which is, you know, just a really long time! [laughter] It's staggeringly vast. Our lives are incredibly short, you know, sixty years if we're lucky, eighty, a hundred if we're really lucky. It's tiny. Can we actually see this moment right now, right now, this moment, through the lens of our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>? We don't know what came before. Theories and religious theories aside, we don't know what comes afterwards. This moment here - colour, light, sound - is in the context of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> and that kind of vastness. Can you get a sense of the moment through that lens<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > This moment here is in the context of death" data-href="From Insight to Love#This moment here is in the context of death" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^7-1

Now, this is a practice. This is one possibility of practice. Sometimes that will bring up <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, but sometimes there's a way of just being with it that actually it opens up into something else. And that's what we're interested in, this opening up into something else. We're not particularly interested in building <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, like I said<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Again we are not interested in building fear" data-href="From Insight to Love#Again we are not interested in building fear" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-2

So just a reminder. Our own and others. And what might happen if that's the case, if we're doing that, if we're practising that way, what might then happen to the heart and the heart's relationship with self, with other, with life? So these are possibilities to play with - if not on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, then, you know, on your thirtieth <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>.

And having that running alongside or a backdrop to the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice.

They are also subject not just to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> but to the uncertainty and change that is, in a way, woven into the fabric of the moment of our lives. They don't know what the next moment will bring, what will happen to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. Can that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, too - it's just a quiet reminder - can that be woven into the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice? I'm talking about the possibility of taking the whole thing to a whole other level, really<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > They are also subject to the uncertainties of live" data-href="From Insight to Love#They are also subject to the uncertainties of live" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-5
###### 7-6
So there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, there's the vastness, there's the contemplation of all of us being subject to uncertainty. When, if through our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a></span> practice or whatever, we're actually contemplating <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, we have a current of that contemplation going on, what we can notice is a very rapid kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>. And this is one of the doors, and for some it's the easiest door, actually, into <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>. When I look at myself, what I call my self and my life, my sense of it at first sight, the sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> is something fixed and something that's lasting. I'm the same self that I was yesterday, and that I was twenty years ago, and I will be the same in twenty years' time. But when I look more closely, more microscopically, I actually can't find anything there that stays the same, that doesn't change. Everything is changing. You can get a sense that this self, it's not what I think it is. There's nothing that I could find that's fixed in that way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Impermanence of my self as door into anatta" data-href="From Insight to Love#Impermanence of my self as door into anatta" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-6
###### 7-7
So again, if one's used to contemplating in this way particularly, sometimes in the course of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice you can just bring in that contemplation. So in a way, one's sitting or walking, doing the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, and just a little bit more space to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, including the change that's going on right then, the moment-to-moment change and the unfindability of self, the unfindability of a fixed self. In that space of what opens up, because the sense of solidity of self has given way a little bit, in that space, again, more <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> can come in. It's possible, a whole other level of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> can come in. Possible to explore, possible to play with<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > The unfindability of a fixed sense gives way for space where metta can come in" data-href="From Insight to Love#The unfindability of a fixed sense gives way for space where metta can come in" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-7
###### 8-1
Another possibility. I'm just going through a lot of territory very quickly. Really, just to let go of what doesn't feel relevant, and maybe to take a few pieces or one piece or whatever. With <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, when I look again at my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> and what I call my self, all I actually see is a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. A <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> sensation, a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of a sight, a sound. I can't find anything else but <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span> of things. Or a thought or an emotion. All I see - there's nothing else. To have a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> requires some thing to perceive. And I see: I can't find a self, and all I find is these moments of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. It's almost as if 'I,' the 'I' is nothing else but these moments of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. Because <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> takes a world to perceive, outer or inner, it means that this self, being only <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, is not separate from the world. This is not easy to understand, I know, but all I see is moments of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. Those moments of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> are part of the world and part of me. I cannot separate. If I can open to that sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">non-separation</a></span>, in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">non-separation</a></span> comes the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, a whole deeper sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, possibility, and of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">First characteristic</a></span>: <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> and change, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > All I see are moments of perception that are both part of the world and part of me" data-href="From Insight to Love#All I see are moments of perception that are both part of the world and part of me" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-1

**(2)** Second one, **<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>**. So this means <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">unsatisfactoriness</a></span> or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in its very broad sense. One reflection is that, again, we're actually all in the same boat with this. We're all subject to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>, subject to the difficulties of life, to the struggles of life, to the problems and the sufferings of life.

We are all in the same boat with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>. It's a factor of life. It's a fact of existence." And just dropping in this sense of, "We are all in the same boat." What does that do to the heart?

As I mentioned in one of the talks, can also begin to notice something with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. So '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>' meaning constricting ourselves around something, pushing something away because we don't like it, because it's unpleasant, pulling it towards us. '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a></span>' - that whole thing. Can notice: when the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> is there, what happens to the heart? So just to notice this. It's like an experiment. When there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, the heart closes, sometimes just a little bit. And you can actually feel that. Sometimes just to put the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> of the chest area, just very lightly, and notice: when there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> there, there's a slight closing, or a large closing. When the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> goes, the heart <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> opens. Just to notice that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > When theres clinging the heart closes when the clinging goes the heart centre opens" data-href="From Insight to Love#When there's clinging the heart closes when the clinging goes the heart centre opens" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-3

So another possibility is to be doing the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice when we move to it, to be in the moment doing that, again, broaden the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> a little bit, and just be aware of if there is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to anything - to a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> sensation, to a sound, pushing it away, struggling with something, to an emotion, whatever, to a train of thought. Is there <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> there? And if there is, is it possible to actually just relax and release that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>? And in so doing, the heart opens. So to be doing the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice with actually a slightly larger sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> that's aware of whether there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> or not and just releasing. Just keep releasing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> as a way of opening the heart<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Doing metta with the awareness of whether theres clinging" data-href="From Insight to Love#Doing metta with the awareness of whether there's clinging" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-4
###### 8-5
So that's, in itself, a practice to do that. The way in usually is to have, again, this sensitivity to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>, a subtle sense, a sensitivity to the subtle sort of sense of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>. That subtle <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of the body</a></span> will reflect when <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> is around. It will cramp up or constrict, sometimes in very subtle ways. Can pick up on that in the slightly broader <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> as one's doing the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and just relax it. In so doing, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> relaxes, the struggle relaxes, and the heart opens<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > The body will reflect when clinging is around" data-href="From Insight to Love#The body will reflect when clinging is around" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-5

That's the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>.

Sometimes, and in really deep practice, there _can_ be a sense of just merging into a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> or merging into a kind of infinite <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>.

It was Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, which is the holiest day in the year, and when you sort of - what's the word? - open your heart and your wrongdoings, etc., to God, and the forgiveness of that. It's the holiest day of the year. And it was in the synagogue, and the rabbi's there, and everyone was praying. He suddenly sinks to the floor and starts beating his chest and saying, "I am nothing! I am nothing!" And then the cantor, the guy who leads the singing and the choir, then _he_ sinks to the floor and starts beating his chest, "I am nothing! I am nothing!" And then the janitor, the guy who cleans the toilets and things, _he_ sinks to the floor, "I am nothing! I am nothing!" And so the cantor turns to the rabbi and says, "Look who thinks he's nothing!"

With <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>, working with it directly, it's a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> at <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. Usually we look at <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, a thought comes up, either we're completely identified with it and we say it's 'me' or it's 'mine.' Or a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> sensation is there, it's 'me' or 'mine.' Or an emotion, 'me' or 'mine.' Sometimes we're actually conscious that we're doing that. We're conscious that we're saying, "Yeah, of course it's me and mine. Of course it's my knee. Who the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hell" class="internal-link">hell</a></span> else's knee is it?!" [laughter] Or, "Of course it's my thought." Sometimes it's very conscious. Most of the time, it goes on without us even being aware of it.

So what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> is saying is not so much a sense of making a philosophical statement: "There is a self" or "There isn't a self." And actually, he tended to ignore that question, said it's not the appropriate question. He'd say, rather, can you practise in a certain way? And that way is, can you look at the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Present moment" data-href="Present moment" class="internal-link">present moment experience</a></span> and actually just unhook the 'me' and 'mine'? So 'me' and 'mine' goes and puts its hook of identification into everything. And all the difficulty and all the problem that comes out of that. He says, can you just unhook and regard the moment's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> sensation, the thought, the emotion, whatever it is, as not me, not mine?

So again, a number of people have mentioned, and it's very common because it's very human, a kind of judging <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> come in. And often it's judging of ourselves. And the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind" data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">comparing mind</a></span> comes into, in this case, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> situation. In a way, a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> is just a mirror of what goes on in our lives; it's just we're seeing a bit more closely the kinds of thoughts that we have anyway, the comparing, the judging<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > The comparing judging mind" data-href="From Insight to Love#The comparing judging mind" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-4

So we're sitting here, and we think, "God, I bet that everyone else is probably in the 134th <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span> by now." [laughter] "And I'm still struggling away with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a></span>" or whatever. Or, "Actually, they're probably all <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightened</a></span>, and they could probably all go home. They're just staying so that I don't feel too bad." [laughter] Or whatever. This is very common, you know. And often it's us we put down, or it's others. You know, it's others, and we look at someone, and we say, "Call yourself a meditator?" or whatever. It comes in either way. It's the same deal. Comparing, measurement, judgment - this is part of what <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>-sense is. It's like the other side of the coin of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>-sense. It's what self-sense does. In a way, it _has_ to do it. Self, you could say self feeds on measurement. It gets its _oomph_ and its <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> from measuring, from comparing, from judging. That's how it actually creates a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a></span> between this and that, "This is me, and that isn't." And it does it by comparing, by measuring. To establish a difference between self and other, I need to compare, I need to judge. So it's woven very tightly into the fabric of what self-sense is and what it is to be human, really. And woven into <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > The self-sense gets its energy from measuring comparing judging" data-href="From Insight to Love#The self-sense gets its energy from measuring comparing judging" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-5
###### 11-1
Not to underestimate the power of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> for working with this. So judgment thoughts, comparing thoughts, they're thoughts. And there's a certain groove that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> gets into, comparing, judging. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Mettā</a></span> is another thought. And gradually, one <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> at what we're doing is establishing another groove, a much more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> and helpful groove to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, that's actually about connection and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>, not judgment, not comparison. Slowly, over time, the groove of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> will be more established than the groove of comparison and judgment and measurement. And that's a real possibility. In the moment when comparison is happening, to kick the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice in, to inject a bit more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> into the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice is also helpful, because it's like using the thinking that's already going on, and just saying, "I'll use the thinking <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> because it's already going on, but I'll use it in a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> way. And I'll just plug away at that until the comparing and all that begins to lose <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>." So really to trust the power of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> as we get on to it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Over time the groove of metta will be more established than the groove of measuring comparing judging" data-href="From Insight to Love#Over time the groove of metta will be more established than the groove of measuring comparing judging" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-1

At a deeper level, though, the judgment thoughts, again, they're not me, not mine. It's like thoughts are just arising out of nowhere and disappearing back into nowhere. It's like having a radio on a very bad radio station, that's just putting out these thoughts. They're not me, not mine. The more, in time, we can practise seeing our thoughts that way, the more freeing. And we can really have a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> from judgment in life, a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> from believing or being involved in any of that stuff. Nothing that I'm talking about today is abstract. I'm talking about very real possibilities. It's completely possible for everyone in this room to be totally free of judgment, self-judgment, of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind" data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">comparing mind</a></span>, of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind" data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">measuring mind</a></span>.

So the 'not me, not mine' is looking at the moment's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, and just quietly regarding it as 'not me, not mine,' whether it's a thought or a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> sensation. So again, you're doing the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, you can just, if you have a little skill already in this area, or if it already seems to be happening, experiment. You're doing the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, you're doing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. A bit more space. What else is happening? <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Body</a></span> sensation, thought, whatever, just seeing it as 'not me, not mine.' Including the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, because we also will then have an identification with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, which is a more subtle identification. We can let go of that identification. And that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> that opens up will be imbued with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. If it's not imbued with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, something's a little bit off balance with the practice, a little bit barking up the wrong tree. So with these <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="three characteristics" class="internal-link">three characteristics</a></span>, one of the indicators that they're working properly is that they bring <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, and not a sense of coldness and disconnection or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, as I said before<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > The emptiness that opens up from not me not mine is inbued with love" data-href="From Insight to Love#The emptiness that opens up from not me not mine is inbued with love" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-3

And similarly, it's actually possible to direct the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, towards other, another person, and actually regard _them_ as, whatever is happening, their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> is 'not me, not mine' in their case. What we call their '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a></span>,' what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> called '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a></span>,' what makes up their <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, is also not belonging to anyone. You would think, "Well, who is there to give <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> to?" But somehow, it's possible that that actually just opens up a whole other level of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Others experience is also no me not mine" data-href="From Insight to Love#Others' experience is also no me not mine" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-4

Okay, I think I'm going to stop there. And like I said, please, please just take what was relevant from that, which may be zero. [laughs] And don't bring in the measurement. It may be a possibility that you may be able to work with some of that, a little piece, one or two pieces. Partly it's important, I feel, just for this stuff to be out there, just for people to have a sense of the possibilities of the depth of the practice and the breadth of the practice.

And I think about what would that be like, falling off a cliff or things like that. And I find it really centres me sometimes. Other times, it brings that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> up a lot again. I'm just curious of your thoughts about that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Thinking about dying sometime centres me other times it brings up fear" data-href="From Insight to Love#Thinking about dying sometime centres me other times it brings up fear" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-3

Rob: You can talk about that kind of contemplation of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> as a separate thing. So let's talk about that first. Sometimes in the contemplation of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> - and I think it should be part of practice, so it's not something morbid. And people think, "Hmm, I don't want to do that. It's a bit depressing." Sometimes in doing that, it will bring a real <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centring</a></span>, a real sense of the preciousness of life, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> of it, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a></span> of it. Sometimes it will bring up <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Yes sometimes centring sometimes fear" data-href="From Insight to Love#Yes sometimes centring sometimes fear" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-4
###### 12-5
I would say just in terms of that practice, to keep working with it until it brings almost a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> with it as well - preciousness and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>. And the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is just a stage that one works through. In the context of what I've been talking about today, bringing it into the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice, if it brings up the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, it's not the right thing to bring in at the moment. So you might bring it in and it actually brings a sense of preciousness, of the gift of life or whatever, and in that sense can deepen in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. But if you bring it in and actually it's just stirring up some <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> and stuff, it's actually going to close the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> down a little bit, and I would leave it for that time and go to something, either come back to a very basic <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice or find some other contemplation that will help. So again, to reiterate, just being with the basic practice, there's already plenty, so you don't necessarily have to start adding things. I'm just putting it out there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Focus on preciousness and freedom with fear just a stage to work through" data-href="From Insight to Love#Focus on preciousness and freedom with fear just a stage to work through" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-5

Yogi: Does the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of one characteristic lead to helping the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of the other characteristics<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Does understanding one help understanding the others" data-href="From Insight to Love#Does understanding one help understanding the others" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^12-7
###### 12-8
Rob: Yeah, absolutely. People generally tend to have a favourite - it's the one they can kind of understand the easiest, and also their particular one that leads to a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> for them. And I don't know if human beings are roughly divided into three. I have no idea. [laughter] But they probably aren't, is my guess. The <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span> one directly is a bit more difficult to understand. So for example, as I was saying, with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, if we just take <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, which is probably the easiest one to understand for most people. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a></span> obviously is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, so everyone understands that. If I see that things are <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span>, I begin to see that they cannot give me a reliable sense of satisfaction; they cannot fulfil me in any ultimate or lasting way. So I begin to get an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span> characteristic, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">unsatisfactoriness</a></span>. If I'm contemplating <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, something comes up, some moment, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, a thought or an emotion or a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> sensation, and I can see: it's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span>, therefore automatically it's unsatisfactory in that sense<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Something is impermanent therefore automatically unsatisfactory" data-href="From Insight to Love#Something is impermanent therefore automatically unsatisfactory" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-8
###### 13-1
These contemplations are not big - at first they might be quite cumbersome, like, "This big contemplation. I'm going to plunk it down on my practice, and it's this big thing." It can get to the point that it's almost like wearing some glasses - you don't even realize you have them on. It's very light, very just in the moment [snaps fingers] that's how were seeing, and there's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> that comes with it. If I see <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> and I have a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">unsatisfactoriness</a></span>, there's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> there. I let go, I let go. And again, it doesn't lead to any coldness or disconnection from life. There's actually a warmth that goes with that. And then <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> might lead to a sense of, an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>, because, like I said, I look and I can't find anything that's not changing. I absolutely cannot find anything that does not change. The <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> is fixed, lasting, permanent, steady. And I look inside, and all I see is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, so therefore no fixed self. It's not really real in the way that I thought it was. All I can say there _is_ is a continuum of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> moments, a continuum of experiences through time. So <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> can lead to the others like that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > The resulting letting go is not disconnection and it can lead to an understanding of anatta" data-href="From Insight to Love#The resulting letting go is not disconnection and it can lead to an understanding of anatta" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-1

Yogi: Okay, I understand all that. Let's say <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> is what I understand.

###### 13-5
Rob: It might be. I don't know. You'd have to answer that. I feel that the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span> through <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> is not quite at the same level of depth of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> as <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span> directly. But it can be enough to free, and it's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> we're interested in, rather than a certain badge of whatever. It may be enough. And if that's your one, and if that's what works for you for <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>, that can bring enough <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>. But there are ways of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span> that go even beyond the notion of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, a whole other depth. If that's accessible, then that's great; if it's not, it's fine. There's enough <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>. There's plenty of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> in that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Yes it might be but we are interested in freedom rather than a certain badge" data-href="From Insight to Love#Yes it might be but we are interested in freedom rather than a certain badge" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-5

###### 13-7
Rob: Yeah, more practice, and certain kinds of orientation in the practice, asking certain questions, looking at certain <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span>. Or, for instance, practising directly in this way of regarding things as not me, not mine. Which you may be able to move towards through the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, in the sense "I can't find anything, therefore it doesn't belong to any fixed <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, therefore it's not me, not mine." But working in that more direct way can bring a bit more depth. I don't know if everyone would agree with that, teachers and whatnot, but that's my view<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Yes more practice certain questions orientation relationships" data-href="From Insight to Love#Yes more practice certain questions orientation relationships" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-7

When you're practising <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and you want to bring that into your practice … I'm not sure what the question is, really, but … ^14-2

###### 14-5
Rob: Just to amplify a little bit what Rachel said: in working with this characteristic of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span> directly, there is an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> in the sense of what's going on. There's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span>, and one relaxes that. Then there can be a sense of release, relief. Then what might show itself is a kind of more subtle, deeper level of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. And then one could just go on in this way. And the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> just deepens and deepens and deepens. That on its own is an absolutely fantastic way to practise. It's just a deepening and more and more release, more and more calming. It goes back and forth between opening and a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span>, opening and a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span>, at deeper and deeper levels<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Going back and forth between opening and a sense of contraction" data-href="From Insight to Love#Going back and forth between opening and a sense of contraction" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-5
###### 14-6
So the question was: if it can go deeper and deeper levels, and you're in the context of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice, how do you know when to kind of, you know, jump off the elevator, so to speak? [laughter] It doesn't really matter. I would probably say, if you're opening your practice out a bit, just whatever <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> you notice, see if you can let go in that. And then, rather, pick up on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> that's there and be in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> with a slightly more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. Then you'll notice more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, perhaps, and you can let go of that. Or you may just want to do it a little bit just as a way of kind of kick-starting some <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. The heart's opening because there's less <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, because you've let go of it, and you're just accessing some <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, and then you can leave it at that and just be in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. And maybe revisit it occasionally. But I wouldn't worry too much about the levels. In this context, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> is the important thing. So you're just using it as a way of deepening the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. You understand? Does that answer?

###### 14-8
Yogi: It's not exactly a question. It's just a reflection, really. I haven't been feeling any <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span>, but when you were talking about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span>, I was noticing [?].

###### 15-1
Rob: Hmm! [laughter] Yeah, could be that that could happen by the very mechanism that I was talking about. So that it's bringing it into <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> - maybe there's a memory of it or an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of it as I'm talking about it. And then what's happening is a subtle <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> to it is kicking in, which is natural. And that's enough to start things spiralling. A lot of this stuff goes on below the radar of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>. So it's possible there was just the seed of it, and enough <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> kicked in, because that's what we do with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, that it started something.

[?] Because I hadn't been aware of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> either, and then when you mentioned <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, it turned it on.

###### 15-6
Rob: And that's fine - you don't have to go looking for it now in the practice! [laughter] It's funny, as I was talking, I was aware of a strange feeling in the room as I was talking about it. Anyway. Yeah, it can, same thing. But how much of our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is bound up with future? "What will happen? What will happen to me? Will it be okay? Will it not be?" To me, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> talks about practice and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> being the great security. Then there's the feeling, this is what we can really trust, this is where the security is. Over time, you know, all those other fears, they just … It's really a possibility. But, like I said, if there's no <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> in practice, just steam right ahead. Don't worry about it.

[laughter] And I hadn't realized that's what I was doing, but that's what tended to happen. It wasn't going to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>; it would go to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>.

The only thing, the question is, slightly, how do I know I'm not repressing some real <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > How do I known Im not repressing some real fear" data-href="From Insight to Love#How do I known I'm not repressing some real fear" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^15-8

Rob: _Real_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>? [laughter] Sorry, it's my job. I can't help it! [laughter] ^15-9

Yogi: I find the whole thing with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> thing really helpful. I find the amount of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> around has gone down_._ ^15-10
###### 15-11
Rob: Great, great. ^15-11
###### 15-12
Yogi: And that's really helped. But every now and again, I think perhaps I'm just kind of avoiding something else. But I think it would come back. ^15-12
###### 16-1
Rob: A couple of things. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a></span> can become a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span>, absolutely. And I have, years ago, in my life, almost gone through a phase of years when it seemed like <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> became a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>. Somehow something slipped into a kind of groove where that was - not a _default,_ but so common. And often there was nothing to be afraid of. There was nothing even happening. It just slipped into that. Or there were things that I amplified through <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Its possible to just slip into a groove of fear" data-href="From Insight to Love#It's possible to just slip into a groove of fear" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-1
###### 16-2
<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Mettā</a></span> is a huge antidote for that, huge. The less <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> there is, the more chance of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span> kind of finding that groove and becoming a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span>. The more <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, the less soil <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> has to establish itself as a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span>. So real power in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice. And also in the realization this is a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span>, like - no one's too young to understand this analogy - like a record. [laughter] When I was a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> student, as a graduate <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> student, they had a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> library - this is completely an aside - and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> library had records and CDs that you could play, and go listen to whatever piece the teacher told you to listen to. And they had CD players there. This was in the States. And an undergraduate came in and had been given a record of something to play, to listen to, and was trying to fit it in the CD player. [laughter] He had never, he wasand had never seen a record before. And then completely <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>-boggled that it actually had things on both sides. That's completely irrelevant! [laughter] ^16-2
###### 16-3
The sense of things getting into a groove. And how much of what our life is is just grooves. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> gets into <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span>. They can be <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span>, like <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. You can get into a groove of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span>. And we can get into, of course, grooves of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, of judgment, of irritability, etc. And we either feed or starve them - those are <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s words. We feed or starve. And just to see that is already a huge <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, just that much, that things, mental factors are <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span> or not, that we can feed and starve. And things have <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span>. Like I was talking about, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> have a relationship. We feed <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, we starve <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, inherently in feeding <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. We feed <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and we starve <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. To begin seeing that relationship. And then the other thing I was going to say, what do you mean "real <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>"? So that's a real question. Real <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> to me is there's a rhinoceros charging at me. Do you want to say a little bit more<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Much of our life is just grooves" data-href="From Insight to Love#Much of our life is just grooves" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^16-3
###### 16-4
Yogi: No, I'm just interested because you described one way of working with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> and feeling it. And sometimes there are things, there are things to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. Tends to be future things<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Sometimes there are things to fear often in the future" data-href="From Insight to Love#Sometimes there are things to fear often in the future" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-4
###### 16-5
Rob: Tends to be future. And as we go a bit more in the last week talking more about the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of things</a></span>, you actually see there really is nothing to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. That is a very deep <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>. Genuinely, there is nothing to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. There's no thing to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, and right now, yeah, it's caught up with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Genuinlly there is nothing to fear" data-href="From Insight to Love#Genuinlly there is nothing to fear" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-5
###### 16-6
Yogi 2: Isn't it depending on <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>? If in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> you have a certain standard, a certain idea of what you want the future to be, then the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is coming from what you want. But if there's no idea, there's no conditioning about I want my future to be a certain way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Fear from wanting the future be a certain way" data-href="From Insight to Love#Fear from wanting the future be a certain way" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-6
###### 16-7
Rob: Totally. Can be <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of _not_ having something or having something. And there's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to an idea of something. Some of that is good. We can <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a></span> to the idea of I want to grow in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, I want to grow in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span>. And if we hold it lightly enough, that's okay. It's an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of our future. Like I was saying, what do we need to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a></span>, to build, to establish <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, whatever word you want to use? To establish <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span>. So some of that's okay and it's appropriate and it's wise and it's healthy<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="From Insight to Love > Cultivating positive qualities is helpful" data-href="From Insight to Love#Cultivating positive qualities is helpful" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-7
