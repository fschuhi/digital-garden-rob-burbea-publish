###### 1-1
Okay, what I want to talk about today is a little bit some of the different expressions of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, some of the different <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>. So first just to restate something I said in the instructions this morning, which is that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> is not just one feeling. We have this word, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, and we go looking for _one_ thing: "What is that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>?" And try and see, "Have I got it? Have I not got it?" And just to really be conscious that it's not one feeling. Could more accurately talk about perhaps a constellation of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span>, when it expresses itself as a feeling at all. There's a constellation of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span>, and I've said, sometimes it will take on, it will feel to be, to have, a slightly different colour, a slightly different flavour. Sometimes it's very calming, very soothing. Sometimes there's a quality of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> in it. Sometimes it's a very bright <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, a very sort of luminous <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>. Sometimes bubbly. Sometimes there's a real warmth in it, or gentleness. So in the practice, however it seems to kind of come up and manifest, it's fine, and to really allow those differences, allow those differences of flavours, of colours. And just to notice and feel. It's all included in what we mean by <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Metta is a constallation of feelings" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Metta is a constallation of feelings" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1

And sometimes, and you may have noticed this already, sometimes we're doing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice and we're aware of our own or someone's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and then the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> meets that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and actually is then coloured - and perhaps quite strongly at that point - by <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, by the kind of tenderness of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And we'll go into quite a lot of detail, the difference between <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. But really not to worry too much about that. In a way, it's just words, and not to strangle the thing too much with words and concepts. So very much to allow the different flavours<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Metta can also be colored by compassion" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Metta can also be colored by compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2
###### 1-3
And then we have these categories that we've been slowly going through. We started with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, and the benefactor, and the friend, and it will go on. And to really see that this is just a tool. It's just a tool. The aspiration of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> is for something that extends itself boundlessly, without limit. So usually our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is quite narrow in its scope. It's just towards ourselves, hopefully, and maybe a few people around us that we care about. And the aspiration of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> is a really boundless <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, completely without limit. And the categories are just a tool to help us move towards that boundlessness, that's all. So there's nothing fixed about them. A person can be our benefactor one day, and then they say the wrong thing, and they get a demotion. [laughter] And they find themselves in the difficult category. And then hopefully we work it out, and they get a rise, and they're back to benefactor or friend or whatever it is. But there's nothing fixed about this at all. And similarly, of course, the difficult person can rise through the ranks. Just to see: it's just a tool. It's just a tool<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Categories are not fixed they are just a tool" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Categories are not fixed they are just a tool" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3
###### 1-4
And so the first one we start with, which we spent two days on, is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>. And the huge importance of giving <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> to ourselves, of really having a relationship with ourselves of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. It's really crucial. It's crucial for our lives. It's crucial also for our practice of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. And so it's interesting: sometimes, for some people, this is very difficult, for all kinds of reasons, to give <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> to oneself - for, you know, reasons in the family, upbringing, or the education; all kinds of reasons. It can be very challenging, actually, to give <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> to oneself. And some of the reasons sometimes are just cultural. We live in a culture that - it's a weird mixed message, I feel sometimes. It's a culture of individuality, of self, of _what I want_ and going out to get that. And at the same time, the notion of loving oneself in a healthy way is often regarded as selfish. So we're getting this very mixed message. And I remember last year on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> being struck by, especially when we moved on to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, how many people found it difficult to stay with giving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> to themselves<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Category the self" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Category the self" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4
###### 2-1
So the culture might say it's selfish, and for whatever reasons or combination of reasons, that's there, or it may be there. And sometimes it just ends up that's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span>. It's a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> to not give <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> to ourselves, or to regard it as indulgent or selfish or whatever. And somehow, through practice, we have to weaken that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span>. So every time we say, "May I be well, may I be happy, may I be peaceful," we're actually weakening that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span>. And not to underestimate the power of that. The analogy I gave this morning, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s actual words, "Drop by drop, the bucket is filled.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > It can be a habit to not give love to ourselves" data-href="Expressions of Metta#It can be a habit to not give love to ourselves" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
And the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> also, when he talked about this, giving <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> to ourselves, he said something very strong. He said, "You could search the entire universe for someone more deserving of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> than yourself, and you won't find that person, you won't find that being." So there's something - to me, it's a very powerful statement. There's something he's pointing to. Whatever we think we've done or not done, or worth or not worth, or however we rate ourselves and measure ourselves and all that disease, really, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> is saying you're worthy of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, you're worthy of giving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> to yourself. This is an enormously powerful statement. And to see, as I said before, the necessity of this, that when we begin to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> ourselves, we are that much more available to giving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> to others. And in our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> we are that much less needy in what we are going to get back, and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> can be more pure. Through loving ourselves, we're not only giving a gift to ourselves. We're actually giving a gift to others, to humanity<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > According to the Buddha yourre worthy of giving love to yourself" data-href="Expressions of Metta#According to the Buddha your're worthy of giving love to yourself" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
So there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, and then there's the benefactor and the friend, which we've gone into. Sometimes when we talk about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, we talk about it being unattached, and it's said that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> - that's a funny phrase; it means what kind of looks like <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> at first but actually isn't. So something that bears a lot of similarity but actually isn't. And the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> is what's called attached <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. In other words, "I'll <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> you _if_," and then a whole list of whatever. So just to see in the practice when this comes up, when the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> has more attachment in it or less attachment in it or whatever. It's fine. It's part of our humanity that this comes into the practice. Not to expect a pure <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> all the time that's completely free of attachment. We can see this in the practice<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > The near enemy of metta is attached love" data-href="Expressions of Metta#The near enemy of metta is attached love" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
Can we then include our humanity, our complexity, the messiness of - I was going to say _some,_ but actually probably _most_ of our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span>? This is just what it is to be in relationship, all kinds of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span>. There _will_ be attachment coming in. In the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice seeing that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a></span> of attachment, you don't want to be, "Oh, no, attachment. I'm doing it wrong," or "Oh," pushing it away or whatever. Actually just to see it. Seeing it, being aware of it is part of the practice and part of the learning process. If we're not familiar with what attachment is, we're not going to learn about _it_, and we're also not going to learn about what _pure_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> is. So not to be in too much of a hurry to judge or discard or whatever, and just to see<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Dont judge or push away attachment but rather learn about it" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Don't judge or push away attachment but rather learn about it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 2-5
And we have this category of the friend. And to ask: what is it to be a friend? What is it to be a good friend? And again, sometimes with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, and sometimes for me (and I know I'm not the only one), reading the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sutta" data-href="Sutta" class="internal-link">suttas</a></span>, we can read about this stuff and it's almost inhuman, it sounds, almost something otherworldly or abstract. Reading the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sutta" data-href="Sutta" class="internal-link">suttas</a></span> is sometimes a bit like chewing cardboard. It's not that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Juiciness" data-href="Juiciness" class="internal-link">juicy</a></span>. It doesn't seem to sometimes relate too much to our actual life. What is it to be a good friend? Some of that, to me, is really seeing another, really seeing a friend. We talk about <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> not being attached, but to me, being realistic, being human, to be in a friendship means I also want to be seen. So I see the other, but I am seen. And this is, you know, we can talk about idealized <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, but in the reality, in the nitty-gritty of our life, we see, hopefully, the other. We give that fullness of seeing. And we want to be seen. Maybe we _need_ to be seen. And we see ourselves as well. We see ourselves. And this is a huge part of what <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation practice</a></span> is about, just seeing ourselves - whether it's vipassanā or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. Seeing ourselves. And we appreciate the other. We appreciate their particular <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>, their particular uniqueness, their particular expression in the world<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Category friend" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Category friend" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-5
###### 3-1
And for many, to take in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a></span> is also quite a big step. Are we open to actually hearing someone express <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a></span> of how we are, what we are, who we are, how we did something? This is a huge part of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, as well, receiving that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. And for many, this is not easy. Are we appreciating other, are we appreciating ourselves, and are we letting in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a></span> of others for ourself? So often, for many of us, these things - seeing, being seen, appreciating, being appreciated - were not actually there that healthily or that fully in the growing up, in the family environment, in the education, in the social environment, etc. And so to me, one <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> at practice, a big part of it is actually re-parenting ourselves. We're giving to ourselves the kind of attentiveness, the kind of seeing, the kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a></span> that maybe we didn't quite get as fully as possible when we were younger. Re-parenting, re-gifting ourselves with that. And that can be, you know, one <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> at it is that can be a very important focus of practice for many years, many years<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Re-parenting ourselves" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Re-parenting ourselves" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
As I said, we have this idea, or we hear about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, we read about it, maybe in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sutta" data-href="Sutta" class="internal-link">suttas</a></span> or whatever, and we get this aspiration: it's boundless. It has no limits. No one, no being is excluded. And it's also unconditional - it does not depend on you saying that you like me or being nice to me or anything like that. It's unconditional. It doesn't even depend on you being that likeable or that nice. It's unconditioned and boundless. And sometimes, as I say, it can seem a bit unreal. We can also get the sense that we're sort of aiming to be these <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> machines, and everyone will, at the end of this three-week <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, go through the grinder, and emerge as this sort of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> machine, #1, #2, #3, and all look the same. That somehow in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, in the high aspiration of it, it's going to preclude our personality and our personal, particular expression of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, our self-expression in that, our uniqueness. And to me, it doesn't mean that at all, absolutely doesn't. So not to make <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> something unreal in our life<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Metta being unconditioned and boundless can seem a bit unreal metta machine" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Metta being unconditioned and boundless can seem a bit unreal metta machine" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
I think it was yesterday that John talked about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>, and we'll be talking much more about that. And again, this is very important, to really be clear that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and certainly <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span> are not closing the door on our individuality, on our uniqueness, on our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">particular self</a></span>-expression. Actually, rather the opposite. It's more a question of, "Am I attached to my particular individuality, my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">particular self</a></span>-expression in a way that's causing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> for myself or other?" Usually, normal human beings, normal human <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, the answer is, "Yes, I am." I'm somehow regarding this particular individual as somehow separate, somehow fixed. A fixed self, a separate self, and an independent self. And if I view my individuality and the whole culture of individuality and what I need and what I want and what my rights are, if I view it from that vantage point of a separate, independent, and fixed self - bound to cause <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> for myself and for others. No question<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Relationship to Anatta" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Relationship to Anatta" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3
###### 4-1
If I have another view, and I begin to see that this individuality, this uniqueness of self-expression is actually arising from an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">infinite web of conditions</a></span>, absolutely unfathomably infinite, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>-blowingly infinite, unentangleable <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">web of conditions</a></span>. So just the physicality of who _I_ am, in this case: there was the genetic make-up of both my parents, and where that came from, and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Infinity" data-href="Infinity" class="internal-link">the infinite</a></span> regress of that, the sunlight, the food, where all that comes from. So just in the physical being, it's actually an infinite web that has given rise to this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a></span>, this form right now. And then psychically, psychologically, mentally, emotionally, everything that has influenced in the present or in the past, everything that I've read, everything that I've heard, all the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> I've listened to, all the conversations I've had, all the interactions, all the education. All of that. Everything, everything, everything. Every moment of my life has come together in some completely inextricable web to create this, and in some completely unrepeatable way, to create this particular form right now, and including this particular expression right now as I'm talking<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Its an infinite web that has given rise to this appearence" data-href="Expressions of Metta#It's an infinite web that has given rise to this appearence" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-1
###### 4-2
When we see that individuality in that context, then we're completely free to be as unique and individual and expressing ourself in any way, that we feel free to. But it's always embedded in the context of all of life, of the whole universe. It's never divorced from that. It's actually inextricable from that. We can hear that as an intellectual concept and think, "Ah, yeah, that's cute," you know.

So there's the friend and friendship and all that that means. And then we extend, and tomorrow we'll move on to the neutral, what's called the neutral category - which actually will be most of the six and a half billion people on the planet. They're actually neutral to us. And this is quite interesting; this is an interesting category. Sometimes, again, this can seem kind of abstract or removed, or we're not so involved. In the practice we can begin to lose interest. This is where we start kind of spacing out a little bit. To see: there's something very interesting going on here. What makes someone neutral?

When that happens, we get a tunnel vision: just me and this other thing, whether it's in me or outside of me or another person. Everything else just fades. It's just other, grey other. The more self-sense there is, the more sense of neutrality of other people, irrelevancy of others. And to really begin to notice this, and to really look into this in our life. How is it that we exclude, that we put others in the background? Now, obviously some people are more in our everyday life. But something's going on here about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and self. And to really look at that and investigate it until it's very clear. It's also another <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> at seeing what we call the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of self.

The more we struggle, the more we <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a></span>, the more self is built up. Self by itself is empty. It needs that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, that struggle. This is something that, spiritually speaking, we really need to understand. We need to be completely in ourselves clear about this.

So there's the benefactor, and the friend, and the neutral. And sometimes, as I said, the friend or the benefactor, there can be some difficulty, and they find themselves in the difficult category. Well, they probably don't know it, but whatever. They're in the difficult category at times. So I also feel very strongly that an important part of what we might call the realistic expression of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> is working with the difficult with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. In other words, actually expressing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, expressing a "no" when we need to in a situation: "No, actually that's not okay. No, that was overstepping a boundary," whatever it is. That kind of strength of "no," in the context of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, in the context of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. So <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> is actually a strong thing, it's not some namby-pamby Pollyannaish thing. It doesn't mean being a doormat. It doesn't mean that everyone's then going to step over us, and we don't care, and everyone just treats us like a doormat. Sometimes we end up acting that way, a bit like a doormat, because of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of actually expressing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of saying that "no," inability of setting boundaries.

I have a very good friend who's suffered for many years, suffers from <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="depression" class="internal-link">depression</a></span>. And she's beginning to realize in more recent years that, for her - this isn't for everyone with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="depression" class="internal-link">depression</a></span>, but for her there's a real, first of all, inability to express <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> and to even be with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> inside herself when something happens. And she's beginning to see what she does with it: she turns it inside and kind of attacks the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, starts to attack herself, and it ends up in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="depression" class="internal-link">depression</a></span>.

And I see this as being very, very common in sort of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="spiritual circles" class="internal-link">spiritual circles</a></span>, or spiritual-type people. It's extremely common. And I know it is certainly true for me in the past, a real shyness about expressing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, about just feeling <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> even. I feel that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> is something very complicated, and the expression of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> is something very difficult. It's one of these areas that we tend to jump to a conclusion maybe too quickly. If we're into <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> and all that: "It's bad. No <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, no expression of it." Or we may be into certain kinds of psychotherapy that are all about letting it out, and venting it, and expressing it, and the catharsis of that. But just not so quick to conclude. It's, to me, a very tricky area. It's definitely true to say that there's too much <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> in the world. There's too much violence, hatred, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">ill-will</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. We just have to open a newspaper to see that. Just have to go into a lot of high streets to see that. So <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> is complicated, and it's interesting<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Anger is complicated" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Anger is complicated" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-3

Oftentimes <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> is blind in a number of ways. It's blind to its causes. So something happens, and we tend to think, we feel angry, we tend to think, "_You_ did that wrong. _You_ are making me angry," or whatever. We don't see the wider, again, the wider <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">web of conditions</a></span>. I needed to be seeing the situation in a certain way. I needed to be in a certain mood. I needed a whole host of inner and outer factors to be there for the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> to come. A lot of them are inner in the way we have been, in the moments preceding that, predisposed to seeing or assuming or perceiving or holding a situation. And all that, that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vessel" data-href="Vessel" class="internal-link">crucible</a></span> of conditions, are the causes of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>.

So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> has this, I would say almost inherently in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> (very lightly saying that), almost inherently in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> is a blindness to its causes and the web of causes, and the greater picture of causes. But as I said, this is a very complex area. So <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> can be blind to its causes, can be blind to its effects. Oftentimes when we have <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> it's kind of like a heat, a pressure inside that just wants to kind of burst out and burst forth, and we want to express it and get it out<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Anger can be blind to its causes and effects" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Anger can be blind to its causes and effects" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-5

I remember, I don't know when it was, twenty years ago or something, I had just started working in psychotherapy when I lived in America, quite an intensive psychotherapy process. And the therapist said, "You need to express some of this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. You need to get it out." And so she suggested I go to the gym and pummel a punch-bag. I was a very keen client [laughter], and so off I went to the gym, and this huge punch-bag. I was pummelling this thing. I connected with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, pummelling this punch-bag, and what I noticed was, I would do it and I would get more angry. And just start pummelling it more, and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> would build. Being a very keen client, I just kept going, and there was huge rage building up. And I did it - this was over weeks, actually - and it got to the point where my hands were blistering and bleeding<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Story Pummeling the punshing bag to get out the anger" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Story Pummeling the punshing bag to get out the anger" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-1

At a certain point, some sense kicked in, and just realized: this is actually _building_.

It's building the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. At first I thought, "Oh, now I'm connecting at deeper levels of it. Now it's really coming up."

So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> can have this blindness to its effects - on ourselves, we think it's going to release, it's going to let something go, and also on others, on the effect it has on others. And <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> can also be blind to itself. It tends to view itself as, when we're sitting with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, "I see a completely clear vision of something.

I'm going to talk a bit more about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, but it's very complicated, so I don't want to say one thing or the other. I just feel like, for me, it's an ongoing exploration with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. I've seen there've been times when I've been in this camp, times when I've been in this view. And in a way, I feel maybe for me right now the wisest thing is not to settle so much on "This is how it is, and this is not how it is," and just to keep the creativity and the questioning open with that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > With regard to anger keep investigating" data-href="Expressions of Metta#With regard to anger keep investigating" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-4

When we express or when <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> is expressed very uncensoredly from one to another, I feel as human beings we are enormously sensitive and vulnerable; we are fragile creatures, our hearts are fragile, our very physicality is fragile, our energetics are fragile. When <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> is thrown at us, it's extremely difficult not to just react to that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, not to just automatically go into a reactive mode. Someone yells, and we just immediately go into that, and it just builds. To me, I think it takes quite an evolved being to hear, you know, have that torrent of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> come at them, not automatically go into reactive mode, be very <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a></span>, distil the truth of what's being said, and respond appropriately. Would be a very evolved being working very hard, as far as I can tell. [laughter] So when we fling <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, that's part of what the blindness is to its effects: we expect, "Well, I just want this to change." We're adding a whole load of other stuff. It's very difficult to hear <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> and stay open, and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a></span>, and responsive, and loving<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > When anger is thrown at us its difficult to not automatically go into reactive mode" data-href="Expressions of Metta#When anger is thrown at us it's difficult to not automatically go into reactive mode" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-5

So sometimes it can feel easier to vent <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> in the moment. It feels like there's pressure that wants to come out.

So a real practice in life, I feel, is to - I'm not saying not to _feel_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, because for most of us in this room that would be just a bit ridiculous, a step too far. What is it to feel <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> and to say, "I feel angry"? Not to throw that, not to hurl it or dump it on another person. It's a whole different thing. I don't think that's easy at all, not at all. And it's a real practice.

And then, through practice and therapy and all this, learnt how to say "no." And for the first period, which to be honest was actually a few years, I would basically bite people's heads off, completely nuke them. Went really to the other extreme in the way I said "no," and it caused a lot of fracturing in a lot of my friendships and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span> and family and stuff. Thankfully, you know, I healed it, but. I had a tendency to be a little extreme, anyway. The point is that we're going to make mistakes with this, and we're either going to go to one extreme or the other, and it's fine. It's really fine. If we _do_ make mistakes, a "sorry" goes a long way, a long, long way, a genuine "sorry." And just to expect the mistakes and the moving back and forth as we learn. And I don't see any way other than that it takes years to learn this. And as I said, even then it's an evolving thing. There's no place we come to: "Right, that's it!<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > If we make mistakes in that practice a sorry goes a long way" data-href="Expressions of Metta#If we make mistakes in that practice a sorry goes a long way" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^8-2

A while ago, there was a situation that happened over a little bit of time, and I felt quite angry about a number of things with a person. And I sat with it for a while, and was with it, and met with this person. I remember saying right from the bat, right from the first thing, "I want to talk about something difficult. I'm upset." And I said, "Please, please know my intention is not to retaliate. I don't want to hurt. My intention is not to hurt. I'm still feeling a bit upset. I'm still feeling quite upset, and confused a little bit, not so clear. So maybe I won't express it so clearly, so perfectly, because of the agitation and the hurt." And I felt like that was very helpful. It kind of set something up in this interaction. First of all, it set up the humanity of it, and secondly it set up something about allowing me to then express what it was, what I was troubled by, in a non-perfect way; I didn't have to do it perfectly. And I hope that it also allowed the other person to then be not perfect. So we could be human together<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Story how to be human together" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Story how to be human together" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-3

Now, of course, that intention not to retaliate, not to hurt has to be real. You can't go in there and say, "Yeah, I don't want to …" [laughter] And actually you've kind of got a gun there. So to take the time with this, to really calm, and find that place where genuinely we can say, "Okay, I'm still upset, I'm still hurt, I'm still confused, I'm still angry, but I really, really, really am clear in myself: I have no wish to hurt, no <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">ill-will</a></span>, no wish to be right, to retaliate, any of that.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > The intention not to retaliate has to be real" data-href="Expressions of Metta#The intention not to retaliate has to be real" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^8-4

So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> in the context of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> in the context of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. Sometimes we find ourselves with - someone we <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is angry at us. And we find ourselves having to hear the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. So again, this is quite interesting. I remember being in a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> class in America when I lived there, and one of the teachers saying, "You know, we're not obliged to take in, to kind of bear anyone else's angry <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>. There's no obligation to do that. And you can say to a person, 'I really want to hear what you're saying, but I'm not going to do that when you're in that much <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, when you're ranting and yelling or whatever it is. So if you want to go for a walk and calm down and whatever, and then I'll hear you.'" Of course, then they'll probably be [angry at that suggestion]<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > We are not obliged to bear anyone elses angry energy" data-href="Expressions of Metta#We are not obliged to bear anyone else's angry energy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-1

But there's something, when he said that, when I heard that … And this is, again, interesting about the types of people that are sort of very committed to spiritual practice - I had been so much in the mould of - I think because often people who find themselves in these kind of environments, very committed to personal growth, really want genuinely to admit their faults, to learn about themselves, to change, to grow, to look at their shadow side, their weak points, etc. And so, like I said, I had been very keen, and someone was angry, and I would just kind of open my heart to them, and "Yeah, give it to me." [laughter] And of course I was completely bowled over by this, I mean really, really bowled over. And it would take me, in some instances, days or weeks to recover energetically. And I think sometimes it just goes with a certain kind of earnestness, really, and sort of genuine openness of heart<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > After a yeah give it to me can take weeks to recover energetically" data-href="Expressions of Metta#After a yeah give it to me can take weeks to recover energetically" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-2

So when he, this teacher said that, I was completely like, "Wow, that's radical," just to say, "I'm not obliged to take in that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>. I'm not obliged to do that. But I want hear what you have to say. I want to hear your hurt." _That_ piece is crucial, because often that's the piece that's missing, and that's the piece that allows <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> to escalate - that people, we or another person feels unheard. That's where the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> comes in, or can escalate, at least. And you see this in individuals. You see this in groups of people, in terrorism and all that. In a way, terrorism, you know, you could say part of it is just this trying to break through with violence to try and be heard. A group of people or whatever - I mean, obviously it's much more complicated than that, but a group of people or whatever feels completely unseen in the whole progress of globalization or whatever, disenfranchised, etc., and "I will be heard." And you know, a bomb, what's louder than a bomb to be heard<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > What allows anger to escalate is that we or another person feels unheard" data-href="Expressions of Metta#What allows anger to escalate is that we or another person feels unheard" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^9-3
###### 9-4
When we feel unheard, there's a kind of powerlessness. There's a frustration and a hurt there. And it's that hurt that's not being heard, and the frustration and the powerlessness, and a want to break through that. So a gift to another person is to really hear their hurt, to offer that. So for me, in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span> when there's been this kind of thing, what's been really <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> is when I've been able to see that hurt in another, and actually just the heart then sees the hurt and connects with it, and there can be just the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> there. The recognition, "Oh, I hurt you," and a genuine "It really pains me that I hurt you. I see your hurt. I see how I was a cause in that, and it really hurts me that I hurt you." And there's a genuine sorrow there. So someone, and you know we've all been in this, there are just two hardnesses, two angers bumping up against each other. Someone at some point has to soften, let go, be vulnerable. Otherwise it just keeps bumping. And we've all been there. Okay, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. That was <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> in the context of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Someone at some point has to soften" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Someone at some point has to soften" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-4

Touch. Of course with human beings we express <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> through the hands, through touch.

What would it be to actually even touch ourselves, let the hand rest, the hand rest on the other hand? And feel, allow, a tenderness of touch to flow through, in this case from one hand to the other hand, one hand to the arm, whatever.

And a slowness. Not to hurry. At <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a></span>, there's not really much to hurry for.

I notice very clearly if I'm on the high street somewhere and I've got a list of errands. I need to go to the bank, I need to - I don't know, buy groceries - and I need to go to make an appointment at the doctor, whatever. I've just got this list, and I'm on the high street, in London or Boston where I lived, or Newton Abbot or wherever it is. There I am, and I'm on the high street with the agenda of _what I want_, basically, in the humble form of this list. But basically it's _what I want_. What happens?

We begin to notice the whole diverse, beautiful, wondrous expression of human life in all its diversity: the children with mothers, and interactions, and friends, and exchange of this and that. And it's all going on. There's a widening of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> instead of that tunnel vision again. You can be on the high street, and this sense of boundless <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and all that, it's not just going to be constricted to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> and the careful conditions of a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. When we drop _what I want_, the heart opens in a very different way, has a very different sense of life and the mystery of life. So when there's _what I want_ and we're caught up in that, we close the doors to the mystery. And it's right there, believe it or not, in Newton Abbot, if any of you know Newton Abbot.

When we slow down, slow the hurrying, drop a little bit _what I want_ (and especially <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span> we can see this), there can come into the being a kind of stillness, a stilling of the being at a very deep level. Unforced stillness just organically comes into the being, this stillness. It can. In that, a sense of silence - and I talked a bit about this in the opening talk - a sense of silence can actually begin to stand out, to have a prominence. This sense of silence and all that that brings with it, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> of that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Dropping _what I want_ brings into the being a kind of stillness" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Dropping _what I want_ brings into the being a kind of stillness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-1

I touched on this, again, in the opening talk, just briefly: one of the things [about] this sense of silence, as it begins to stand out, begins to emerge, is it allows what's really important to the heart, what's deeply important to rise to the surface. And all the kind of little really flotsam and jetsam, all the trivia that we're so preoccupied with, that can kind of just settle. And what we really, what the heart really cares about in this life can begin to come up and be clear. And our priorities are clear and in place and accessible. That's a huge gift of silence<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Flotsam and jetsam can just settle" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Flotsam and jetsam can just settle" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-2
###### 11-3
Related is something else, and especially silence, especially in the context of a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>: just automatically, memories come up of things that we did, that we wished that we didn't. Or something we said that we wished that we didn't, or didn't say that we wished that we had. So this is a very common possibility of the softening of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and the silence. I view remorse as something very much a part of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice and the silence and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. Just remembering and allowing that, remorse being different from what guilt is. I don't know if this is correct English, but guilt, I would say, is when <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> has got wrapped around something: "I did that wrong. I am a terrible person. I'm unkind. I, I, I, I, I. You, you, you, you, you. I, I, I." Self has wrapped itself around. Remorse is something much more soft, much more open, much more creative: "Oh, that's what I did. That's what I neglected to do. I feel the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> of that. I feel the sadness of that," but it's open. Not so much self. It's just saying something not so much about _me_, but about _behaviour_. If that situation arises in the future, I'm very clear I want to do it differently now. And so the sadness is part of realigning the intentions of the being. So that kind of remorse, that kind of sadness, can be a really important part of, at times, of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice and the silence<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Guilt and remorse" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Guilt and remorse" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-3

As, potentially, for some people, this silence can really begin to stand out and become prominent, and it becomes almost something all-pervasive and all-inclusive, there's almost a mystical sense of silence, something really palpable. There's a poem about this by <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Pablo Neruda" class="internal-link">Pablo Neruda</a></span>. Again, some of you might know it. It's a very beautiful poem about this mystical quality of silence and its relationship to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>.

So it's possible, one of the possibilities is for this sense of silence to really become strong and really have a very deep effect. In the silence, what happens is the silence begins to embrace everything, be a backdrop for everything, hold everything. The silence begins to stand out, and we begin to let go of our preoccupation with things, with objects, which is the normal preoccupation of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, with things and with objects. That begins to go a little bit into the background. We let go of that preoccupation, and it's almost like some other sense, this sense that Neruda is talking about, some other sense can begin to come to the fore, and make its impact on the heart<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > The silence begins to stand out embrace everything" data-href="Expressions of Metta#The silence begins to stand out embrace everything" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-6

That possibility also opens the door to a possibility of this sense of the _being_ being in the space of silence, and in a way, receiving <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. That space, that silence holds everything. Everything arises and passes in that silence, in that space. And we begin to get a whole other sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, a whole other sense, as <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> as a kind of holding, as a kind of receiving, that we ourselves are held and received. All things, all beings are held and received in that silence, in that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Love as I kind of holding" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Love as I kind of holding" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-1

So on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, we happen to be choosing the technique of the phrases, the systematic way of doing it that way. But actually there are tons of ways of doing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. So very fruitful for some people is having a figure like <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">Jesus</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Kuan Yin</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Avalokiteśvara</a></span>, some figure that completely embodies <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, and one is just reminded of that and tuning into that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, and allowing that to radiate and permeate from that being. Or there can be this sense of silence and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> into the silence. It actually doesn't really matter too much. But the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, especially in these other ways, if you have a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a></span> figure or the silence or something like that, it begins to give a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> not always _doing_ the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, that the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> is self-created, it's always self-created, coming from effort. There can be a sense that, in a way, something is unveiled, something that's woven into the fabric of the universe: <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. In a way, some veil is lifted, and we begin to get a sense that somehow it's there all the time<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Love being unveiled somehow its there all the time" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Love being unveiled somehow it's there all the time" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-2

A little while ago, there was a work retreatant here, and we were working on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> in different ways, so some slightly different ways than what we've yet been doing here. But she wrote me a note where she talks a bit about this, and I keep it because it's put so well, so beautifully. And English isn't her first language, but: ^12-3

> Practising after the meeting in the library an old, well-known, apparently insoluble <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> arose very quickly. Already aware that there wasn't any wholehearted <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span>, yet an attempt to embrace the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> lovingly coming from a hidden agenda of wanting it to go away, to dissolve. Somehow it was clear that this unloving attitude was known by the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, so it wouldn't pass, but intensify. What was needed was very clearly a pure embrace of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, breathing to expand the capacity of accepting the unacceptable, and relax. Breathing to expand the capacity to love the unloved, and relax.<br/> ^12-5

> And then a change. Deep, pitch-black darkness, familiar though, was around, and the thought was, "Even the unloved is surrounded by <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> all the time anyway." And it went on: "We _all_ are surrounded, loved all the time, anyway. We may not know, we may not have experienced it yet, yet <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is around all along, awaiting us to open up to it, to become sensitive to it, to receive it. With all our incompetence, imperfection, impurities, we are surrounded by <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> nonetheless.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Even the unloved is surrounded by love all the time anyway" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Even the unloved is surrounded by love all the time anyway" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^12-6

> If that is so, doesn't it bring with it a kind of responsibility, as it were, to expand our capacity to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> unconditionally? As human beings we are never able to embrace unconditional <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>; it always embraces us. Always has been and always will. Is that true? Question. How can <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> appear as dark black? Isn't it said and written umpteen times, it comes as light? Am I experiencing a hoax<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > We are never able to embrace unconditional love; it embraces us" data-href="Expressions of Metta#We are never able to embrace unconditional love; it embraces us" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^12-7

I assured her that she wasn't! [laughter] It's very beautifully put. And again, not to grasp at any of this stuff. I just say this or that; not to grasp it. But just to say that this actually isn't that uncommon. It's not that uncommon. So some may relate to this. Some may relate to the idea of a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a></span>, to the silence, to this kind of all-encompassing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, and some not. It doesn't matter. The important thing, I think, is that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>, through this practice somehow, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span> are changing and opening. And that is really significant. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perceptions</a></span> are changing and opening. And that's more crucial than it at first appears<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Perceptions are changing and opening" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Perceptions are changing and opening" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-1

So we go back to the phrases for a second. Sometimes with the phrases, as I said, sometimes there's no feeling of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> there, and we're just patiently, steadily working away, grinding away at the phrases. Sometimes there _is_ a feeling of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. And then the feeling of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, whatever it is, warmth or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a></span> or openness, sometimes it's there and it's quite steady, and then you might want to experiment with letting the phrases go, or let them get very light, and maybe let them go, and just be with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> of that feeling. Now we have the friend and the benefactor. Sometimes it's possible that we are giving <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> to the friend or the benefactor, to another, and there's the sense of them, and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> deepens, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> deepens, and even the visual sense of them kind of fades a little bit, and there's just a sense of a heart radiating <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> to another heart. Just a heart to a heart<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Experiment with letting the phrases go" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Experiment with letting the phrases go" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-2
###### 13-3
Sometimes even _that_ sense begins to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span> a little bit, and it's just hearts merging, and just a sense of a kind of communion of hearts. And maybe the sense of the other person is gone a little bit, and there's just maybe light there, or just this sense of communion, warmth. Communion of hearts. In that, then there is a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > Communion of hearts" data-href="Expressions of Metta#Communion of hearts" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-3
###### 13-4
Now, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> - I'll go into this in a bit more detail, too, in another talk, other _talks_ - <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> is not quite the same as <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>, but it's hugely important. It's hugely important for a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> to open to that sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> in their life. It's a sense that comes and goes, but it begins, potentially, to question the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, our everyday, taken-for-granted <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a></span>: "I'm here, you're there. I'm here, the world is out there." This is our everyday, normal <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. If - and I'm talking about a lot of practice with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> - if there is this going in and out of the sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>, a sense of just merging, a communion of hearts, it really does begin to question our taken-for-granted <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a></span>. And a person can <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a></span> over time: what actually is the truth? <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">Separation</a></span>? <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Oneness" class="internal-link">Oneness</a></span>? What's the truth<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Expressions of Metta > A sense of merging begins to question our taken-for-granted perception of separation" data-href="Expressions of Metta#A sense of merging begins to question our taken-for-granted perception of separation" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^13-4

So I'll be picking up, we'll be picking up again on this, these questions of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> and truth and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span> and all of that, as the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> goes on. But I think I'll stop there for today. Just to outline some of the range of possibilities of the kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span> and expressions of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. ^13-5
