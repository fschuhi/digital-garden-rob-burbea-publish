###### 1-1
Okay, so today I want to talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> - it's the fourth of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a></span> - and specifically I want to talk about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> and its relation to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> (actually, maybe broaden it out if we have time). So as you know, there are these four <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a></span>, four divine or sublime abidings, dwellings of the heart, and we've been working mostly on the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> (the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>), the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> (<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Compassion" data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">karuṇā</a></span>). <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Catherine McGee" data-href="Catherine McGee" class="internal-link">Catherine</a></span>, I think - Monday, or one day - talked about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, which is the third one<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Equanimity is the fourth of the brahmaviharas" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Equanimity is the fourth of the brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1
###### 1-2
And just a word about that: usually, that third brahmavihāra gets translated - the Pali word is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">muditā</a></span> - usually it gets translated as '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">sympathetic joy</a></span>,' which has the meaning of, if someone is happy, if some good circumstance befalls someone, something happens in their life to make them happy, then instead of being jealous or indifferent, we are happy for their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>. We're happy for them to be happy. And that's the usual way that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">muditā</a></span> is translated, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">sympathetic joy</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Mudita is usually translated as sympathetic joy" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Mudita is usually translated as sympathetic joy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2
###### 1-3
I think that translation actually came from the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="commentaries" class="internal-link">commentaries</a></span>, and in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s original discourses, I'm not sure that he used it that way. The meaning that I prefer is more something like '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">spiritual joy</a></span>,' which isn't a great word, I know, but what it really to me means is a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> in life that's not dependent on the ego getting something, or being pumped up by something, or inflated, or feeling superior or whatever. So a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> in life that is not about the ego getting. And then, of course, as a sort of small piece of that, there will be <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">sympathetic joy</a></span>. When someone else is happy, I will be happy as well, as a piece of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">spiritual joy</a></span>. But it would also include things like <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a></span> at <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span>, like that kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a></span> that I was talking about, like an openness to be touched by life, and touched by the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>, the awe, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a></span> of life, in a way that I can't own, I can't possess it; it has nothing to do with me. It has nothing to do with me being great, or giving me anything particularly. So some kind of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> that's not so based on the ego. That's the third one<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Mudita is a kind of joy thats not so based on the ego" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Mudita is a kind of joy that's not so based on the ego" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3
###### 1-4
And then the fourth one is this word '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>.' The Pali word is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity" data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">upekkhā</a></span>. And this is a strange word. It's not a word we use much in English. And again, if you wandered down Newton Abbot high street and you asked people, you know, "How often do you feel equanimous?" or whatever, you'd probably get some puzzled looks! [laughter] It's not a very common word. And sometimes it can be hard to understand what it actually means<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Equanimity is not a word we use much in English" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Equanimity is not a word we use much in English" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4
###### 1-5
It's a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span>, a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness of the heart</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. And again, there are two kinds of meanings. One is in relation to all things, so the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, the heart, the being, stays steady, stays balanced, stays kind of unshakeable through its contact with all things in life. So in relation to whatever comes, however difficult, however wonderful, the heart, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, stays steady, stays upright, stays balanced. And that's the broader meaning of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, and the way that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> more often used it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > The heart and mind stay steady through their contact with all things in life" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#The heart and mind stay steady through their contact with all things in life" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-5
###### 1-6
And again, I think through the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="commentaries" class="internal-link">commentaries</a></span>, it has come to have a kind of second meaning in relationship to beings - so specifically as a kind of balancing factor in terms of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Here we are cultivating <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and opening the heart, sensitizing the heart to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of others, and our own, and sometimes acting in the world to try and alleviate the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, to be of service, to be of help. And yet, what we often find is that the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of others is _not_ alleviated. It's not helped. There's still <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> for whatever reasons. Or there's just _too much_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world. It's actually endless. It's impossible for me to end all the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world. Can the heart stay steady with that? Can the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> stay steady, so that we're not keeled over, bowled over, closing down or feeling <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Depression" data-href="Depression" class="internal-link">depressed</a></span> by that? So in relationship to beings, this is what <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> means. It's a hugely important factor in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Equanimity makes the compassion steady in the face of suffering" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Equanimity makes the compassion steady in the face of suffering" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-6
###### 2-1
I want to just go into a little bit how that factor of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> feeds into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice, how we can develop it within the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice, and then broaden it out. Some of it, we've already touched on, but I just want to draw it out once more<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > This talk is about how equanimity feeds into the compassion practice" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#This talk is about how equanimity feeds into the compassion practice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
The first aspect is (which I've said a couple of times at least) - in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice, it has two elements. One is this, what I would call '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a></span>.' We are opening the heart to receive, to resonate with, to sympathize with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that we see. So I see sorrow, and something in the heart trembles with that sorrow, it resonates with that sorrow. Somehow, I don't know - mystically, almost - sorrow that isn't ours, we witness it, and something happens in our heart. Our heart vibrates sympathetically with that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > 1 Opening the heart to resonate with the suffering we see empathy" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#1 Opening the heart to resonate with the suffering we see empathy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
That's only half of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. The other half is this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, this intention that comes out of the being, so to speak, that goes out of the being, that wants to heal, wants to alleviate and soothe that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, wants to comfort it. In the practice, we can actually feel where the balance is in any one moment. So sometimes it will feel like we're very much in the 'feeling the sorrow' side, where very much there's quite some sadness, or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>, or just being moved. And sometimes it can be very lovely, and there's a sweetness to it, there's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> to it; the heart is open and touched. And sometimes it feels like the balance is more, we're just feeling in, tuning into that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> that's going out - the lovely quality of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span>, of light, the balm, the comforting<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > 2 Wanting to heal the suffering energy" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#2 Wanting to heal the suffering energy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
This is a balance that's always moving. It's always moving. So part of the practice is to be aware of, in any one moment, where the balance is. If we're tuning into that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> quality, what's going out, the comforting, the balm, it actually has a feeling of feeling pleasant, and of feeling quite <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span>. So in coming out of _our_ being, it's actually touching us on its way out to others. And we feel healed. And there's a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a></span> in it. There's a kind of brightness in it. There's a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> in it. And there's even a kind of sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span>, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> in it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > The outflow of compassion from us to others touches us and we feel healed" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#The outflow of compassion from us to others touches us and we feel healed" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 2-5
So sometimes there are times, and periods, even, when there's a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>. There's a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>, almost, in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice. Something in the heart is opening, and it's almost like a veil - we're removing a veil, and the heart just comes in a very raw contact with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of the world. We see, like a veil has been removed from the eyes, from the heart, and we're touching directly the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world. We see the immensity of it. We see the universality of it, the fact of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, the fact of change, the fact of disease, the fact of all of it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > There can be a lot of grief in the compassion practice about the immensity and universality of suffering" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#There can be a lot of grief in the compassion practice about the immensity and universality of suffering" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-5
###### 2-6
And the heart can, in that - there is a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>, and there can be tears and sorrow and a real being touched at a very deep level, which in a way is important. For some people, that will be there at times, and it's part of the heart opening. It's not everyone that goes through something like that, but it can be there at times, very subtly, or more strongly. And in a way, it's part of our humanity to be touched. We're not, in a way, wanting to be untouched and inhuman. It gives the heart a quality of some kind of opening, some kind of tenderness that's really important<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Its part of our humanity to be touched" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#It's part of our humanity to be touched" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-6
###### 3-1
But we need to really be conscious of this balance in our practice of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And I would say that in order that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> in our life is something sustainable - in other words, we really feel like we can practise <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> all day every day for the rest of our lives, and not feel tired, not feel overwhelmed, not feel burdened by the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world - we need to keep tuning into that loveliness of what's going out, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a></span> quality of what's going out, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> of it, and keep being touched by that and our selves nourished by that. That gives the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, in that moment and in our lives, in the being, a kind of strength and sustainability. That's very much part of what <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> means - strength, sustainability. It also gives a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span>, gives a balance, and this unshakeability, which is all part of what <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> means. And gives the heart a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">buoyancy</a></span> so that we don't feel, as I said, burdened, overwhelmed, sinking underneath the weight of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of the world. This is hugely important. So there's that balance<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Equanimity means buoyancy not to sink underneath the weight of the suffering" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Equanimity means buoyancy not to sink underneath the weight of the suffering" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
The other, or one other, piece that's really important with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, going back to near the beginning of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a></span> in one sense is a kind of non-distractedness, you could say. When the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is distracted, what's really happening is it's toppling over, pulled out to reach things. It's pulled out towards this, or pulled out towards that, and that very distractedness is a non-balance, a non-<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. So really not to underestimate the benefits and the power of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> in the deepening of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> - <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice, and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> generally<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Dont underestimate the power of samadhi in the deepening of equanimity" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Don't underestimate the power of samadhi in the deepening of equanimity" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
I remember last year, after, I think it was after about two weeks, and there was one retreatant who, very thoughtfully, I thought, he said to me in an interview, "I think I don't want so much <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. I feel like when I go out into the world and deal with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> in the world, the fact is, I'm moving in life. I'm moving. There's busyness, there's distraction, there's all of that. There's basically not a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> compared to …" He was getting in relatively deep states here. "It would be more relevant," he said, "to practise here the rest of the time in states of non-<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, you know, actually when I'm quite distracted." I didn't ask him how he was planning to distract himself, but … [laughter] Anyway<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Story last years retreatant who didnt want to do samadhi pointing to the busyness of life" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Story last year's retreatant who didn't want to do samadhi pointing to the busyness of life" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3
###### 3-4
And so this was quite thoughtful, but as I say, not to underestimate. There's something that happens with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. It sort of allows any quality, whether it's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, whether it's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, whether it's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, whatever it is, to kind of sink into the cells, and to be there, woven in almost to the fabric of our being. So what's more common is to _not_ have so much <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, think we've understood something, think we've developed a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and find that when we go out it's a bit shaky<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Samadhi allows any quality to sink into the cells" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Samadhi allows any quality to sink into the cells" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-4
###### 3-5
So again, not to say there's a cut-off point, but just generally that we want to be not underestimating the power of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. Having said that, what he said was also important, because sometimes we _are_ very busy, very distracted, and it's important to practise, too, when we're busy and when the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> isn't that settled. So both are important<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > But its also important to practice when the mind isnt that settled" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#But it's also important to practice when the mind isn't that settled" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-5
###### 3-6
Generally, as <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> deepens, as a general quality in the being, it actually leads to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. It's part of the natural progression of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> - through physical <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a></span>, what I talked about; through <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>; through peacefulness; to actually descend to depths of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. And then, in the course of that - and this is usually a progression that takes months and months, but in the progression of that, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, too, gets kind of sewn into the being, and it's really something that's accessible in life, not just in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > The natural progression of samadhi leads to equanimity which eventually becomes also accessible outside samadhi" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#The natural progression of samadhi leads to equanimity which eventually becomes also accessible outside samadhi" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-6

Okay, so there's this balance in the practice that I was talking about. There's the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. There's also this factor about how much <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> is _doing_ the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice. So sometimes, especially from the beginning weeks, really, if you're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span>, it can very much feel like I'm sort of pumping away at the phrases, and then sometimes there's a feeling of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and then sometimes not. But it feels like <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> is doing it, and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> is sort of trying to get this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to happen, and then feeling the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> if it's there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > How much is the self _doing_ the compassion practice" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#How much is the self _doing_ the compassion practice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-1
###### 4-2
But some of you, I think, have noticed this - and again, not to make any kind of measurement out of this - but sometimes, as the sense of deepening happens in the practice, it can actually feel like it's not <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> doing it. It's not _me_ making <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. It's not me kind of pumping everything up with the phrases, and sort of making sure it's okay. It's more like <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is just something there that we can tune into, and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> a little bit gets out of the way. It's not <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> doing it. This is quite an important area, or shift, that can happen in practice, if it happens. Self and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> have a very, in a way, clear and interesting relationship. Basically, the more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>-sense, the bigger <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>-sense, the stronger <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>-sense, the less the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. It's actually that simple. It's either one or the other. As <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>-sense gets quiet, as the ego gets quiet, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> is the natural state. There's less self in there, invested and worrying about, "Will this work out? Will it not work out? How's it all going?", and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> is a natural settling, of when there's less self being built up<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > As the self-sense gets quite equanimity becomes the natural state" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#As the self-sense gets quite equanimity becomes the natural state" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-2
###### 4-3
Sometimes, too, and some of you have reported this, as well: when there's less self doing it, there can sometimes feel like a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span> comes into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice. And again, it's not <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> doing it, but it's almost like there is a space, like there is space in the universe, and that space is imbued, is kind of shot through with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And that space, that space of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, holds any <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that comes up in ourselves, in others, in an effortless way, through all time. So any <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that was, any <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that is now, any <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that will be is just held, effortlessly, naturally, organically in that space<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > With spaciousness any suffering can be held effortlessly in that space" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#With spaciousness any suffering can be held effortlessly in that space" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-3
###### 4-4
And this is a sense that can open up. It's not me, little old me, holding someone else's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. It's actually, whatever you want to say, the universe holding it, the space holding it, the vast heart holding it. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">Spaciousness</a></span>, space, is also a really significant factor of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. So we could talk about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> as being <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> and balance, but it's also a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span>. That's a very prominent feature of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Spaciousness is a prominent feature of equanimity" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Spaciousness is a prominent feature of equanimity" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-4
###### 4-5
Now, both of these - whether it's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> doing it, and it just feels like this being over here giving <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to that being over there, or it feels like there's not really much self doing it; it's just <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, it's just <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> being held in the space, just being held by a space of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> - both are important and both are necessary. So it's not to feel like, "Oh, one's irrelevant after a while." This self giving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to that self is very human. It's part of our humanity, and it is a necessary aspect of our humanity, a necessary level, in a way, of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Still the self giving compassion is a necessary aspect of our humanity" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Still the self giving compassion is a necessary aspect of our humanity" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-5
###### 4-6
So there's the balance, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, the busyness (or not) of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, and the openness to space and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span>. And also something a little bit more complicated, or potentially more messy, which is: sometimes when we are involved in a relationship, any kind of relationship with someone, or involved in helping or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, something gets out of balance, and what's really happening is I am wanting or needing something from that person or from the situation. Sometimes it's clear, and sometimes it's a little more under the surface. So sometimes to ask oneself, "What do I want or need for myself here?" This can be quite complicated and messy and not clear, and it's not to say that we shouldn't have wants or needs either<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > What do I want or need for myself here" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#What do I want or need for myself here" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-6
###### 5-1
If we're talking about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to a friend or a relationship, sometimes we feel when the other is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, when there is a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the other, we feel, and especially if it goes on for a long period of time, we feel that "My needs in the relationship are not being met. My needs in this relationship are not being met." Or we are involved in a relationship or a situation of care for someone who is clearly causing <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> for themselves in an ongoing way. They're maybe in some addiction or some destructive behaviour or whatever it is, and again, it can feel like, "My needs in this relationship are not being met." So this is quite a common scenario, and I know, in my past, I've certainly been involved in these kind of situations. Someone once said to me - I mean, it's strange language they used - but it's a very high level of care, to be in that situation in a healthy way, and caring for someone who's doing that, without having it be unhealthy - on both sides<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Its challenging to care for someone who is clearly causing suffering for themselves" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#It's challenging to care for someone who is clearly causing suffering for themselves" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1
###### 5-2
Am I taking care of my needs, if that is the situation? So maybe I _do_ have genuine needs. And again, this goes back to a talk a while ago: we can talk about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and it can sound all very abstract and completely clean and pure, but the reality of our life is that we are involved in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span>, and we all have needs and wants within that. So am I taking care of my needs? Am I finding a way to do that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Am I finding a way to care of my needs" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Am I finding a way to care of my needs" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^5-2
###### 5-3
So it may be that we're in a situation where we actually end up feeling quite lonely. Or we feel like we need a friend. Or that, as I said, we're not being met, or we're not feeling loved. This is quite common. Sometimes it's a little bit even more complicated; we may be involved in a situation where we are actually invested somehow in being needed. So we're interested in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, but another sort of stratum in there is that a part of us actually wants to keep the person somewhat down so that we are needed. And again, this can come in in very insidious ways. Not, again, not to be scared of all this, because this is part of humanity, and it's part of being human. I think some psychotherapies call that co-dependence, that kind of - it's a whole system in place of, "You be messed up so that I can feel needed," and it's just something that human beings do sometimes<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Co-dependence can happen" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Co-dependence can happen" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-3
###### 5-4
Or we may be involved in service, in helping people or trying to help people, and we're actually wanting a sense of achievement. We want this person to get better so we can feel like, "Yeah, right, something happened, you know. I did something. I was helpful." And this is completely understandable and completely normal. Or we may be involved in - and again, totally normal, totally human - we want some recognition for our efforts. You know, we work really hard to help, in whatever field it is, and then just feel like, "Well, it's not really being seen," or being seen in the way that we want it to be seen<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > We might want some recognition for our efforts" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#We might want some recognition for our efforts" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-4
###### 5-5
So all of that. And it's quite, you know, complex and messy, and very human. Can I take care of myself in a healthy way? Can I get at least _some_ of what I need in a healthy way? So some of this is not easy, but to begin asking that question in the situations. When we're involved in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, in a situation where it's difficult, where it feels like the person is difficult or there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, there's judgement, there's irritability with them, or we're just frustrated, we're frustrated with the situation, with the stuckness of the situation, we're frustrated with this person, whatever - really, really skilful to turn the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> on oneself. So again, we tend to assume, to go straight into, "Oh, I just need to inject more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> towards them and clean it up that way." _We're_ <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> there, and to really notice that and touch that with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And then sometimes our relationship to the situation, the person, and the flow of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> in that situation begins to soften, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> begins to soften, and we're able to work more easily<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > So we need to ask ourselves in those situations how we can get at least some of what we need in a healthy way" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#So we need to ask ourselves in those situations how we can get at least some of what we need in a healthy way" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-5
###### 6-1
You know, it's an immense task, I think, to take these <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a></span> on in our life. And it's really a lifelong thing, to say "I'm really deeply interested, deeply committed to living a life, living in the world with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>," and somehow be steady through all of it. That's immense. And we do see that part of where the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span> comes in is just realizing (and a lot of it is very clear) that there are limits to how much we can help, there are limits to our influence. So certainly we see this politically. In all political situations, all political structures, systems that I can think of, there's a real limit to the individual's, one individual's capacity to change. So we could see something like - well, all kinds of things that are going on now; just the limits of our influence politically<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Politics show that there are limits in how much we can help" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Politics show that there are limits in how much we can help" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-1

A big part of bringing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> in is actually seeing the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">web of conditions</a></span>, seeing that someone's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">freedom from suffering</a></span> doesn't just depend on me.

My <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> is that's, you know, on one level, of course, that's what's happening.

And I am quite tired! [laughter] Everything's coming together to make a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> talk.

Then, I'll say, as a teacher, you know, you want to put something out there, and you want to say, "Well, I hope this changes people. I hope there's some transformation. I hope it makes a difference in people's lives." And that's a very earnest aspiration, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. But as a teacher, I have to remind myself this is probably just one little drop, or one little seed, which will meet a whole web of other conditions later on. So it may be something happens. Maybe, you know, as I'm talking, someone says, "I've got it! That's it! Actually, I don't need to stay for the rest, Rob. I'll be having tea if you want me." [laughter] Maybe. That would be great.

Maybe it's just a seed. It meets another condition, then it begins to sprout. Maybe it sprouts a little here, and then it gets watered.

So we have to see that what we put into a situation in terms of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and care is only one little ingredient in a vast <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">web of conditions</a></span>. So even, it seems that we're doing all we can to help someone, just to realize that - certainly if they're going to live longer - they will meet other conditions, and maybe something you've done or said, it will just be enough that it can blossom later for that person<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Somthing youve done or said it might just be enough that it can blossom later for that person" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Somthing you've done or said it might just be enough that it can blossom later for that person" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-5

But it's tricky, I mean, it's really tricky. This is a hard one. All these <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a></span> are difficult, but certainly <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> is difficult. And <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, just to be really clear, is not a kind of detachment, coldness, greyness, disconnection. It's not indifference. Indifference is actually the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. So it can look like <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, look like, "Yeah, I'm fine. If you get healed, fine. If you suffer, that's fine," but actually, there's no real care there. So indifference is what _can_ look like <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, but it's not. And this is quite interesting, especially in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="spiritual circles" class="internal-link">spiritual circles</a></span>, when a lot of stock gets put into non-attachment and peace and kind of, you know, being 'beyond' things, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Equanimity is not indifference" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Equanimity is not indifference" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-6

In the Eastern religions, there's this doctrine of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a></span> and past lives and everything, and sometimes people say, "Well, they're like that because of their previous <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and in a way, it's their fault, you know." Or in the West it's, "Oh, it's just God's will." I just can't really relate to that at all; to me, it's really not a useful way of thinking. Or rather, one has to _check_ if it's useful, in the sense that, is an attitude like that bringing indifference? So once I was meeting with someone who was not <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span>, and she was talking about reincarnation and past lives, and she said, "Is it right? Is it wrong?", and I said, you know, "I don't know." I asked her, "Is it actually opening your heart or not? Are you feeling more care coming from it?

And she said "Yes," so I said, "Great. If that's what's helping, then go for it." And the view might change later on, but the barometer is really: what's it doing to the heart? So what is my responsibility? Response-ability - my ability to respond. It's not <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a></span> or God's will as a sort of, you know, leading to indifference, and this is really important<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > The barometer for any view like karma or Gods will is whats it doing to the heart" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#The barometer for any view like karma or God's will is what's it doing to the heart" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-1

So sometimes all those pieces of self-interest that I was talking about, and the way that self can kind of get entangled in a whole situation of care, sometimes that's relatively _not_ there. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="The self" class="internal-link">The self</a></span> is not so invested in an unhealthy way or in any way like that. And still, we vibrate, we resonate with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. And the question for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> is: can the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> stay steady and stay strong, but stay tender, that that tenderness of the heart remains? And sometimes it's very clear that we're seeing someone cause and perpetuate <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> for themselves through <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span>. They're caught in some pattern that they're not <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> - some addiction, some behaviour or whatever it is - and they're just perpetuating the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, causing <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and keeping it going through <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span>. And that's hard to see. It's hard to be with. Especially when the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is there, it's hard to see. When there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> there, it's hard to see<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Can the compassion stay steady and strong but also that the tenderness of the heart remains" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Can the compassion stay steady and strong but also that the tenderness of the heart remains" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-2

So traditionally there are these phrases for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. And it's trying to make clearer to the heart that is already open, already soft and tender with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, it's trying to make it clearer, the limits of our responsibility and the responsibility of an other, and how <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> actually arises because of conditions, and often a person's actions<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Phrases make the limits of our responsibility clearer to us and to another" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Phrases make the limits of our responsibility clearer to us and to another" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-3

Just to say, of course there's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world that comes - it's nothing to do with the person; it's just descended on them from the environment or political situation or whatever. And then there are other levels of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, other kinds of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, that are really what humans bring on themselves through <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span>. And this is what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s really interested in as well. So these phrases - I'll actually just read them: ^7-4

"All beings are the owners of their actions.

Third one, "All actions with intention, be they skilful or harmful, of such acts they will be the heirs.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > All actions with intention be they skilful or harmful of such acts they will be the heirs " data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#All actions with intention be they skilful or harmful of such acts they will be the heirs " class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^8-1

So to me, even just reading it, it's quite sobering, you know, to a heart - when there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, it's quite sobering actually realizing the limits. And so the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> practice in this very formal way is just bringing that recollection to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, bringing that recollection to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> to balance the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, if it's not already balanced<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > This formal equanimity practice brings in the recollection to balance the compassion" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#This formal equanimity practice brings in the recollection to balance the compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-2

And so, we _do_ live in a world where, as I said, there are limits to our care. There are limits to the effects of our actions that we can see, certainly, and limits to what we can do. And so we see, and if you're involved in service, you are involved in situations where one's trying everything one can, one puts everything that one can in, and there's still <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, there's still the situation. But, and I think John said this in the opening talk, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, best way to live. The best way to live. So even if the action, even if the results, are not what we want them to do, the heart of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is the best way to be in the world. And that heart balanced with a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>, balanced with a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. So this balance is not a tightrope. It's not a kind of razor's edge that we're walking. That's quite important. To me, it's more a sense of a softening, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span>. So it's not something very tense, to keep on this balance of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. There's a kind of softening that can happen as the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span> deepens, as the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> deepens, also as the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> deepens. And a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span> that comes with that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Still loving-kindness and compassion is the best way to live even if actions or results seem to fall short" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Still loving-kindness and compassion is the best way to live even if actions or results seem to fall short" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-3

So the more we see into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of self and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of all things</a></span>, the more that kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span> and that kind of softness can come in, and we're able to walk this tightrope (which really isn't a tightrope), we're able to walk that in a much more relaxed and effortless way. I would still say that's very difficult, but the movement is towards a kind of softening<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > The more we see the emptiness of all things the more we can walk in a relaxed and effortless way" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#The more we see the emptiness of all things the more we can walk in a relaxed and effortless way" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-4

To me, as we go deeper into really <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> what <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> is and having that touch the heart - I think I said this the other day - what comes out of that is a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, and peace, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a></span>. Another sense that comes out is some kind of sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a></span>, I would call it. I don't really know another word for it - <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a></span>. And that can take all kinds of forms. A heart that has opened, or is opening to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, there's a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a></span> to the world, at one level, that just comes in. So paradoxically, we see the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of self, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of beings, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of the world, and we're even more devoted to it somehow, even more devoted. And that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a></span> has a quality of not being so attached to the result. There's a real softness in it. There's a softening in it. So seeing into <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> is not a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nihilism" class="internal-link">nihilism</a></span>. I think I said this the other day as well. It's a strange translation, but '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>,' it can kind of make you feel like, "Well, there's nothing. There are no people. There's nothing. Nothing matters." But to go into what's called the extreme view of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="nihilism" class="internal-link">nihilism</a></span> would give rise to indifference, which would be the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. It's a kind of disconnection - disconnect, not caring, disinterested, aloof<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Paradoxically we become even more devoted with seeing the emptiness of everything" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Paradoxically we become even more devoted with seeing the emptiness of everything" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-5

So as we talked about in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice, the more we actually contemplate this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span> in the different ways, the more we actually find it's opening up <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, it's opening up a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love" data-href="Love" class="internal-link">sense of connection</a></span>. It should be, if we're sort of on the right track with it. And we talked about doing that with contemplating just <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> moments, ownerless <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> moments, not really anyone owning these <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> moments of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. And the different ways, and we talked about <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>, and also talked about this sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> being fullness, being <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">non-separation</a></span>, so that I cannot actually find a separate being. It seems the most obvious thing in the world: here we are, a room full of whatever it is, numbers of beings, but as I look deeper and I go into it, I cannot actually find separate beings. Cannot find myself separate, cannot find others separate. And in that, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is there. So there's that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of selves - my self and other selves - and that brings the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, it brings the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. And at a whole other level, there's even the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. You can say, "Okay, well there are no beings, _really_," but even <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, too, as you go really deep into it, that's also empty. And yet, paradoxically, seeing that brings <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> in a way that there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> for it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > I can neither find myself nor others deparate and in that the love is there" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#I can neither find myself nor others deparate and in that the love is there" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-6

Okay. So at the beginning of the talk, I said that the most usual way the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> talked about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> was not so much in relation to beings, but in relation to all conditions, all things. So the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, the heart, the being staying steady, staying balanced, unshakeable, whatever happens, whatever's going on, whatever is coming to the senses. Sometimes to ask ourselves: how much does my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind state" class="internal-link">mind state</a></span> depend on what's going on? This happens or that happens; how much does the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind state" class="internal-link">mind state</a></span> wobble with that? A <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> with it is what <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> is.

There are particularly eight, what's called the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eight worldly conditions" class="internal-link">eight worldly conditions</a></span>, that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> placed a lot of emphasis on. So all conditions he's talking about, but there are eight in particular that he said, "These ones, pay particular <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to." They're four pairs: praise and blame, success and failure, gain and loss, and pleasure and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>. So four pairs. One pole of each pair we like. We like praise, success, gain, and pleasure. And the other pole we don't like, we don't want it. No one wants to be blamed or to be in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> or to fail or to lose what we like. And whoever we are in this life, whatever our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span>, whoever we are, whatever our credentials, we are going to be subject throughout our life to the wavering of those four polarities - no matter who you are. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> certainly, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">Jesus</a></span> certainly, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahatma Gandhi" data-href="Mahatma Gandhi" class="internal-link">Gandhi</a></span> certainly, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Mother Teresa" class="internal-link">Mother Teresa</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="David Beckham" class="internal-link">David Beckham</a></span> [laughter], whoever.

So often when <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>'s talked about, and the question is, "Well, _how_ can I develop <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>?", the contemplation of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> is usually given as the sort of - _that's_ where it's at. And certainly there's a great power in contemplating <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>. But I was talking a few weeks ago with another teacher, and she was saying whenever she starts giving a talk on <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, she notices people just sort of, "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a></span>, right," and this kind of screen goes up: "God, I've heard it before," which is understandable, because Buddhists just, you know, yap on about it.

###### 9-4
I would say, it is curious. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a></span> is extremely obvious. A five-year-old can agree that everything is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span> - well, some pretty low age [laughter] can agree that everything's pretty <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span>. It's very clear to us. The question from the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> perspective is: are we seeing, are we contemplating <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> in a way that's actually bringing a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>, bringing a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>? And if we're choosing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> as an avenue of contemplation, finding a way of doing it that brings that. Because sometimes people are contemplating <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, and "Yeah, it's change, change, change"; there's no <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> coming out of it. So to find ways, and to talk with teachers and friends and whatever, and to find ways of working with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, actually bringing, in the moment, a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>. In the moment, one feels as one's contemplating it, "Ah, oh, yeah, release, release." I think I touched on <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> in one of the other talks, and I'm actually not going to go into that right now<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Find ways of working with impermanence which brings a sense of freedom" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Find ways of working with impermanence which brings a sense of freedom" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-4

The natural progress of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>, as it gets deeper and deeper - and I'm talking about really quite deep states of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> now - naturally move into <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. Naturally and organically, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> is a state of deep <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. How does it deepen? How does <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> deepen?

And we can do this at subtler and subtler levels, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> just gets deeper and deeper.

And then we pick up on a more subtle level, and we let go of that, and there's a bit more <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span>, and it just goes deeper and deeper.

One kind of subtle form of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> at the 'I,' at the 'me,' at <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, so identifying with things.

So it has a certain feeling-tone, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, to it, a certain peacefulness, a certain stillness, and it's the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> kind of tuning into that wavelength, that resonance, and just being there with it, noticing it, feeling it, opening to it, and enjoying it, enjoying it, that allows it to deepen, to settle in the being<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > 3 Equanimity deepens when the mind tunes into the feeling-tone of equanimity" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#3 Equanimity deepens when the mind tunes into the feeling-tone of equanimity" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-4

It's interesting.

It's really an acquired taste, because generally our sense of _oomph_ in life, and _va-va-voom,_ and you know, things we get excited about, are generally _not_ in places of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. They're in places of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> getting really excited about something, either something that we take as good or something that we take as dreadful, so some big drama we're caught in.

And just to mention briefly, also, the place of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">muditā</a></span>, of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, in the deepening of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. I don't have time to go into this today, but <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, you know, whatever word you want - <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, deep <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, whatever word - that forms a basis for the being being able to really open to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. Certainly in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> it's also a basis, but in one's life, when there is more a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> in one's life, we are less dependent on the external circumstances being this way or that way. It makes less of an impact, because we feel like we have enough. And this is a very gradual journey for most people, and a very non-linear journey. But looking into: how is it that my well of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, my reservoir of inner <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, can be deepened in life? And so looking into: how does the being open to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a></span>? How does it open to the mystery of life, to the awe of things? What's the place of art and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> in that? What's the place of our relationship with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span>? All of that. Certainly the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice build those reservoirs over time, build the inner reservoirs of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > When feel like we have enough external circumstances make less of an impact" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#When feel like we have enough external circumstances make less of an impact" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-6

Sometimes we lose our balance, we lose our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> in relationship to a situation either inner or outer, because we are caught up in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a></span>, and "What will the future be? Will this situation get better? Will this person get better? Will this inner situation get better? This emotion, will it ever go away? What's happening with my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, will it ever go away?" We're caught up in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a></span>. And so, for instance, something like climate change, how much of what's going on with that and the way that we as a species are (_if_ we are) addressing it, how much of that is actually caught up in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a></span>. The scenarios on the front page of the newspaper: what will it be like in 2056? It's a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a></span>, which is fine. There's a real skill in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a></span>. So again, in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma practice</a></span> as well, what will my life be like if I don't take care of the kind of intentions I have in life, of the kind of actions, of the kind of speech, of cultivating what is beautiful? How will I be in twenty, thirty years if I'm still alive? What will have happened to the heart? And you can see this in other people, over decades. I shouldn't say this, but one just sees in other people - they've been cultivating or not certain qualities, and as they get older, one sees the being<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > How will my life be if I dont cultivate what is beautiful" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#How will my life be if I don't cultivate what is beautiful" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-7

And so sometimes <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a></span> is actually really skilful, to see: where does this lead? Where is how I'm living, what I'm choosing, where is it leading me in my heart? But sometimes <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a></span> is actually not that skilful, and it can be quite skilful to drop it, to just drop <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a></span>. Not compound a situation, build up a sense of problem, by kind of tacking on the future to it. So here's this difficult situation internally or externally, and I'm just kind of imagining it going on forever, or "When will it end?" Do you see what I mean? You're building a solidity to it by time concept. And this goes on without us even realizing it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > When future thinking is skilful and when its not" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#When future thinking is skilful and when it's not" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-1
###### 11-2
So sometimes it can be really skilful to practise shifting into another mode where one's just kind of snipping off the past and the future, and just seeing, "There's just this moment. There's just this moment." Experientially, existentially, that's all there can be. There's just this moment. And in this moment, all there can be is an impression in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, experientially. So I'm not saying anything about "there is a world or there isn't a world," but from a sort of meditator's contemplative perspective, all there is now is this impression in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, whatever sense it comes through<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Practice snip off the past and the future just seeing this moment" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Practice snip off the past and the future just seeing this moment" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-2
###### 11-3
So I can get caught up in the idea of losing things, or "my house" or "my this" or "my that." All my house can ever be is an impression in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> in the moment. All my anything can be is an impression in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> in the moment. We get so caught up in a sense of solidifying things in a way that experientially they're actually _not_. Now, of course that view has its limits, but as a skilful means in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>, it's actually very skilful. Really practising that, the whole sense of life can shift, over time - this whole sense of life being not as substantial as we tend to take it. This is another kind of approach to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. It's quite a popular approach, actually: just seeing things as impressions in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> in the moment<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Practice seeing things as impressions in awareness" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Practice seeing things as impressions in awareness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-3
###### 11-4
A slightly more sophisticated approach is seeing things as just <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>. They're <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span> that are built, that are <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span>. So this practice that we've been doing this week, with directing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span> towards things, and sometimes the things <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span> - one actually sees that, through the lack of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span> or the lack of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span>, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> is actually getting built, it's getting <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span> or compounded, to use the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s words, constructed in the moment. Without the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> doing something, that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> cannot be there. So something, whatever's going on, is just a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. It's just <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span>. It's empty, in other words. It's empty<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Practice seeing things as just perceptions" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Practice seeing things as just perceptions" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-4
###### 11-5
So through our practice and through our life, when we begin to stop elevating certain things and putting down other things - whatever they are, inner experiences, or outer things, or other people, or situations or whatever - when that movement gets less, when there is less <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a></span> of what we don't like and trying to keep or pull towards us what we do like, when that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">push and pull</a></span> gets quieter (and it goes through a whole range of getting quieter, very, very subtle), this is the movement into <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. And similar to the practice that we're doing now, there can be, as <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">the push and the pull</a></span> gets quieter, there can be a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. Things just get quieter. They make less of an impression in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>. They just begin to dissolve a little bit<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Less push and pull means more equanimity and a fading of experience" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Less push and pull means more equanimity and a fading of experience" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-5
###### 12-1
Sometimes they can dissolve completely. There's virtually nothing left. Sometimes there's just a little dissolving. Sometimes it's almost like the world has become a very soft, gentle flickering of sensation in a very quiet and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a></span> and relaxed way, and that's all that remains of the world. It's just a little burst here and a little burst there, of something that's almost nothing. That's a very deep level of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Sometimes the experiences can dissolve completely" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Sometimes the experiences can dissolve completely" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-1
###### 12-2
And then, at that level, we may think, "Well, hasn't it completely turned round?" So used to think, used to define <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> as being a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> in relation to what's difficult or what's great, or what's exciting or whatever, and the heart just stays steady. As the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> really deepens, not much really arises anyway. There's nothing really happening. So I can't really be equanimous in relation to what's difficult, because there's nothing there to be equanimous in relation _to_. It's gone. It's taken a whole different level of meaning<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > In the end I cant really be equanimous in relation to whats difficult because theres nothing there to be equanimous in relation to" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#In the end I can't really be equanimous in relation to what's difficult because there's nothing there to be equanimous in relation to" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-2
###### 12-3
If, sometimes, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> deepens to that kind of level, there's a real <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> in that. So again, sometimes we hear this word, '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>,' and it's a strange word, as I said, and it can sound kind of cold and dry and grey or whatever. But to people committed to practice and open to that kind of thing, there really is a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a></span> in it and a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> in it. There's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="juiciness" class="internal-link">juiciness</a></span> in it. I don't know any other word. It's not dry. It's absolutely not dry, and there's also <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> in it. There's absolutely <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> in it. In that state, there's a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">non-separation</a></span>. We're not building a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> and other, a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a></span>, by getting involved in this tussle, in this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">push and pull</a></span>.

###### 12-4
There's a very important thing here. Sometimes, you know, describing kinds of experiences or states - it's not to snatch at the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. What's much more important is the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>. So sometimes there's an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, sometimes there isn't; the more important thing is the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>. And the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> there is that, again, similar to the practice that we've been doing this week, how a thing appears depends on my relationship to it. Whether it appears at all depends on my relationship to it. How a thing is, then, depends on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">the push and the pull</a></span>, and is inherently <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Immeasurability" data-href="Immeasurability" class="internal-link">immeasurable</a></span>. There is no _real_ way it is. It's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Immeasurability" data-href="Immeasurability" class="internal-link">immeasurable</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > More important than the experience is the understanding how things appearing depends on my relationship to them" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#More important than the experience is the understanding how things appearing depends on my relationship to them" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-4
###### 12-5
So this is more important than a certain kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. We're actually beginning to see into, in a very deep level, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="immeasurability" class="internal-link">immeasurability</a></span> of all things. All things, so-called 'inner,' so-called 'outer,' their true <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Immeasurability" data-href="Immeasurability" class="internal-link">immeasurable</a></span>. And that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> begins to go deep in the being, and we really begin to understand that in an unshakeable way, and it's that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> that brings the deepest <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. Because then whatever happens, we know that it's not real in its own right. It's actually <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Immeasurability" data-href="Immeasurability" class="internal-link">immeasurable</a></span>.

Because we see the universality of it all. That principle is something that applies to all <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Consciousness" data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousnesses</a></span> - not even just human beings; all <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Consciousness" data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousnesses</a></span>.

###### 13-5
Rob: Yeah, that's an important question, yeah. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Samatha" class="internal-link">Samatha</a></span> in the sense of taking one object, like the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> or whatever it is, and just going deep in that, yeah, eventually that will lead to a deepening, through different stages, and there will be <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. So that's one way. The other way is more a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> way, and that would be what I touched on here - being conscious of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>, of pushing, pulling, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, holding on, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, etc., in the moment, and just relaxing that, finding a way to let go of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> in the moment. And then what happens is, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> is actually an agitation of the being, and so there is a relative degree of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span>. Then, potentially, I mean, you could call _that_ a deepening of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, but in that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span>, because of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span> allows a more subtle seeing, a deeper seeing, so one actually can sometimes pick up on more subtle levels of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, and feel that, and let go of that. And so one way that the whole thing can deepen is just by getting more and more subtle with that. And at a certain point, it gets very subtle, and will include things like just taking some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> to be me or mine or whatever, and we'll go through a whole range of subtlety with that. So that would be going at it via an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Rob two ways to see samatha collectedness vs calming the agitation of the being" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Rob two ways to see samatha collectedness vs calming the agitation of the being" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-5

Yogi: So in a more open, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a></span> way. ^13-6
###### 13-7
Rob: Exactly, yes. And so in the open, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a></span> technique, there's a degree of resting, but there's also some degree of _doing,_ but the _doing_ is a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> - one just keeps <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span>, and then feeling the loveliness, the release of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span>, and then feeling, "Ah, there's a bit more," and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span>. So it's not a great sort of [huffing and puffing]; it's quite <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a></span>. And there's just enough doing, in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span>, to keep the space alive and soft and deepening in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, all of those things. And some of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> gets extremely subtle, _extremely_ subtle as you go deep into it. If you get really skilful at all of that, what you can do, especially if you have a background in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="samatha" class="internal-link">samatha</a></span> practice, is once that open space is there, it's almost like you can filter out the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> and choose to focus in on that, and then have a much more contained <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> which is more like a deep state of absorption. That takes quite some practice, but it's possible, so one can actually move between these two - between a more open kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Rob spaciousness and progressivly letting go" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Rob spaciousness and progressivly letting go" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-7

Yogi: Early on in the talk, you mentioned that a lack of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> is the sense of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> sort of reaching out and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> after things.

###### 14-2
Rob: If it's relatively gross, in the sense of I'm trying to concentrate on this thing and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> keeps getting distracted by this and then that and then this and then that, and one feels like one can't keep the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice, that sort of level, I would just keep doing the steadying of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> with one object. If there's already a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span>, then that's enough <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> to pick up on the sense of just how it feels to grasp after something or to push something away, and you can kind of feel it. If there's a bit more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span>, you feel it in the subtle, physical, in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">subtle body sense</a></span>. It's just a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">subtle body sense</a></span> or a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> of the sense of space, that it contracts when we grasp or push away, and one notices that and then one just lets go. If there's a bit more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, that's a really good way too. They're both valid, and in a way, the answer is really to experiment. So sometimes even in the course of trying to stay with one object, and there's a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a></span> or something, sometimes the best way is just to be more open - feel the pull of that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a></span>, so that you actually feel it as a "Ungh," and you just relax it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Rob depends on level of steadiness spaciousness and energy body" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Rob depends on level of steadiness spaciousness and energy body" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-2

###### 14-6
Rob: I would just feel free to experiment with both ways. Feeling the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is important because, in a way, there's a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> in this approach. What we begin to realize is that something's catching our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> in the environment, maybe, that's very simple - a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. It's unpleasant. There's a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a></span> of it through <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, and there's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> there. And actually noticing, feeling the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. Sometimes it's very subtle <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that we're talking about. Sometimes it's less subtle. But sometimes it can be just the sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> is a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. And one notices that when there's pushing or pulling or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, there's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> there. As I relax that, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> goes. And being actually sensitive to the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and the release of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is really key in the deepening of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. So there's a real sensitivity to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and its release, and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and its release, and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and its release, as the process deepens. So it's actually good to be sensitive in that way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Rob feeling the suffering is important because theres a lot insight in this approach" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Rob feeling the suffering is important because there's a lot insight in this approach" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-6

In the moment, which will be the right approach, it's hard to say. And it's more a question of which practice you're kind of doing at the time. It can be quite important to have, "This is the practice that I'm doing. This is what I'm doing 90 per cent of the time, and this is my sort of emergency backup practice that I'm taking out in emergencies." [laughter] And then, you know, when I'm trying to stay with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> or whatever, and it's really not happening today or this sitting, and I've been plugging away for forty minutes, half an hour, whatever it is, okay, now I plug in the other practice. Other times, the more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a></span> practice is the main one, it's really not happening, and I need to settle the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> with one object. But it's good to have like one thing: "This is what I'm doing. The other one's a backup."
