###### 1-1
Okay, so I want to talk a bit about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, and pick up on what we introduced today in terms of practice. But first I think just a very brief sort of review of the show so far, sort of thing. And at this point, I don't think I need to sort of sell <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> any more to anyone - at least I hope not. But what are we doing here? We're cultivating <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And we can see, we can feel, here on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> and in our lives, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Blessing" data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">blessings</a></span> that come from that, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Blessing" data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">gifts</a></span> of doing that, for our selves, for our own lives, for our own being, and in the world, for others<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > We are cultivating metta and compassion and we can see the blessings that come from that" data-href="Love and Emptiness#We are cultivating metta and compassion and we can see the blessings that come from that" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1

So one <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> at what's going on - it's a very helpful way, a very real <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> at what's going on - is that we're <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a></span> the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and the heart. That's not a very appealing word maybe, '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a></span>.' But we're transforming, we're cultivating qualities of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and the heart. We are planting seeds of intention, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and they bear fruit in their time. They bear fruit. And in transforming the heart, we're transforming our intentions in life. So that gradually, slowly, in a very non-linear way, over time, the way we act in the world, the choices that we make, what we put out into the world, is transformed, is reconditioned. The way we speak, the words we use, what we say, what we don't say, is transformed. And our thoughts and our intentions in life are transformed. And that's a very powerful thing, not to be underestimated. So that's one very important part of what's going on<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > In transforming the heart were transforming our intentions in life" data-href="Love and Emptiness#In transforming the heart we're transforming our intentions in life" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2
###### 1-3
Another part in the sort of big picture of our lives and our practice, what we're also doing is, through the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, through the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, creating a kind of ideal inner climate for growth. I know for myself there have been periods of time when I've been really trying very hard to grow, to understand myself, to understand life - but there wasn't that climate of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> for oneself, wasn't a lot of climate of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. And it was like banging my head against a wall, really. The <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, are ideal, the ideal soil<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Through metta and compassion we are creating an ideal inner climate for growth" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Through metta and compassion we are creating an ideal inner climate for growth" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3
###### 1-4
Third thing: the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>, in his way of teaching, he actually didn't teach too much about technique, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> technique and that sort of - maybe he did, and it hasn't really been recorded. But what he did, one thing that he emphasized over and over and over again, was a sort of approach to practice which was twofold. One part is a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span>. So <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a></span> the heart, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a></span> the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, the being, in the most <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> way possible. And that's one half of the practice. And the other half is investigation, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, looking into life, looking deeply and learning. And these two - <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span> and investigation, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> - support each other and they feed each other. And as an overall principle of what practice is about, that's a very good working model<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > In practice wholesome nourishment and investigation support each other" data-href="Love and Emptiness#In practice wholesome nourishment and investigation support each other" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4
###### 1-5
So again, through the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, through the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, we're finding ways in our lives and in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> of really <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a></span> ourselves very deeply in a very <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> way - what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> would call '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> abiding' or 'skilful abiding,' to abide in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, to abide in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And again, it's just important to mention (I've probably already said it, but): none of this is really about self-improvement, about me wanting to be a better person because I'm not good enough yet. That's not where it's coming from. We are re-cultivating qualities of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and heart, and one can be fully committed to that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Activism" data-href="Activism" class="internal-link">engagement</a></span>, fully committed to that transformation of the qualities of heart, fully committed to that, but there's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">no self</a></span> in it. There's no measurement or comparing or "I should be better than I am." It's just gone. It's just not there as a potent force, and certainly not as a potent force for <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. But the commitment to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a></span> is still there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > We are cultivating qualities of mind and heart but theres no self in it" data-href="Love and Emptiness#We are cultivating qualities of mind and heart but there's no self in it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-5
###### 2-1
So there's this, whatever we want to call it, transformation, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a></span>. There's the climate for growth. There's the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span> to balance with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. Some time ago, I think it was about a year ago, I was teaching a one-day <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and I was teaching it on <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And in the question and answer period, a man asked a question: "Well, okay, that's all very nice, but aren't you just <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a></span> the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>? Aren't you just <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a></span>? How will you penetrate through to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a></span> if all you're doing is recreating the conditions?" So I _think_ he was coming from an earnest place, and it's a good question - <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a></span> being another word for the goal of practice, of nibbāna, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">liberation</a></span>. And I can't remember exactly what I said to him, but we _are_ at one level, as I said, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a></span> the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. There's nothing wrong with that. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> _is_ conditions. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> has these <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span> and grooves. And it can have a groove of irritability, a groove of judgment, a groove of self-criticism, and they're really deep, and they've been deepened over decades. And one thing that we're doing is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a></span> the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. And there's every validity in that, if we're interested in a life that's more open, more peaceful, more happy<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > The mind is conditions - theres nothing wrong with reconditioning it" data-href="Love and Emptiness#The mind is conditions - there's nothing wrong with reconditioning it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
But then the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> also talks about the "conditioning that leads to the end of conditions." And this is quite important. Some cultivations and conditions actually do not just lead to more conditions - they lead to what the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> would call '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">unbinding</a></span>,' a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> of conditions. So <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> are three such cultivations, three such conditionings of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> that actually move (over time, and slowly) toward <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a></span>. So, I think I've already said this, but we can feel like we're here doing this practice, and we're sort of grinding away at the phrases and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, and we're building <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and we're building <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and it's this fragile sort of structure that we're hoping to hold in place. But sometimes, a different sense of it is visible, which is that we're actually getting out of the way. We're doing less and less. And in that doing less and less, we are building less and less, building less and less barriers. And there's the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> there. There's the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And in a way, this process just goes deeper and deeper until what we would call <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a></span> becomes 'visible,' if that's the word for it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > There is cultivation but also that were actually getting out of the way" data-href="Love and Emptiness#There is cultivation but also that we're actually getting out of the way" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
And then, as we've also talked over the time, through dedicated practice to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, there is, at times, possible, a sense of the separate self kind of dissolving a little bit to some extent. The boundaries, the barriers, the walls that we usually feel in place begin to just dissolve a little bit. And comes to some degree, into the practice, for a short period of time or a long period or whatever, a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> - that this sense of me and you, self and other, self and the world that we so take for granted, it just dissolves a little bit, and we have a different sense of life, a different <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of the reality of things. That can come, and it will go. It's a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> that can arise and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > The walls that we usually feel in place begin to just dissolve a little bit " data-href="Love and Emptiness#The walls that we usually feel in place begin to just dissolve a little bit " class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
Through the practice, the walls of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> can begin to soften. In a way, we could say self and ego and all that is built by a kind of problematic <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span>, a view of struggling with oneself, in a way. And to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is actually easing the view of self. And in that there is an easing of the sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a></span>. So there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>, and also as we've touched on over the weeks, the possibilities of getting a sense or glimpses of this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>, this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of self, through the practice, just through the practice of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Cultivating love and compassion eases the view of self which leads to an easing of the sense of separation" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Cultivating love and compassion eases the view of self which leads to an easing of the sense of separation" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 3-1
Okay, that's a sort of brief bus tour, like I said, of the show so far. This morning we began something different. So everything so far, the first two weeks, has been <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> towards _beings_, which is of course how we tend to conceive of it: <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> towards self, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> towards others and all beings. And extending the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> in that very boundless and universal way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > So far metta was directed to beings" data-href="Love and Emptiness#So far metta was directed to beings" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
I remember when I was living in America, and there was an urban centre there. I think twice a year they would publish their brochure, programme. And it would have the list of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span> and all that stuff in it. And for about five years or something, every time, every edition that came out had on the front of it this nice picture of a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> statue smiling or something, and this quote from the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Lotus Sutra" class="internal-link">Lotus Sutra</a></span>, which is one of the very well-known and well-loved <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sutra" data-href="Sutra" class="internal-link">sūtras</a></span>. And this quote said, "See all things with the eyes of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>," or "See all things through the eyes of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>." And so for five years I saw that on the front and said, "Very nice, okay," and went and saw who were the teachers that were coming, what <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span> can I do, etc. And at some point, it dawned on me, "Well, actually it doesn't say, 'See all _beings_ with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>.' It says 'See all _things_ with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>,' which is a different thing." So we begin to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a></span>, what does that mean? Does it mean regard the alarm clock with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>? What does it mean<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Seeing all things with compassion" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Seeing all things with compassion" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
There's another <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a></span> _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sutra" class="internal-link">sutra</a></span>_ called the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aksayamati Sutra" data-href="Aksayamati Sutra" class="internal-link">Akṣayamati Sūtra</a></span>, and that has another very odd sentence in it, which I'll read to you. In the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aksayamati Sutra" data-href="Aksayamati Sutra" class="internal-link">Akṣayamati Sūtra</a></span>, it is said: ^3-3
###### 3-4
> At the beginning of the spiritual life, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is directed towards beings. With those who are further advanced on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is based on dharmas. And for those who have seen <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a></span> [for those who have seen into <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>], <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is not based on anything at all.^[Cf. a translation from Tibetan at Jens Braarvig, tr., "The Teaching of Akṣayamati,"_ [https://read.84000.co/translation/toh175.html](https://read.84000.co/translation/toh175.html)_, accessed June 2021: "Friendliness with living beings as its object pertains to the bodhisatvas who have developed the mind of awakening for the first time. Friendliness with phenomena as its object pertains to the bodhisatvas whose practice is in progress. Friendliness with no object pertains to the bodhisatvas who have attained the patient acceptance of the fact that all phenomena are unborn."] ^3-4
###### 3-5
So we might hear this, and we just think, "What's that talking about?" First thing is this word dharmas. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> is one of these words that can have a lot of different meanings. I think what it means here is what we were doing this morning: experiences, objects of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, things, stuff that is arising for us, whatever it is; a moment of some object of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> is a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dharma" class="internal-link">dharma</a></span>. And again, this is quite difficult to understand, but we think, "What does it mean?<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Dharmas is stuff that is arising for us whatever it is" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Dharmas is stuff that is arising for us whatever it is" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^3-5
###### 3-6
In a way, we began this this morning: directing the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, directing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, towards <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, towards objects of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, rather than beings. And just to review - we did the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditation</a></span> this morning, but just to review. Whatever way of working with that is helpful to you, is fine. So it could be something's happening in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> or the heart or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> or whatever, and there's a sense of bathing it, bathing it in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, directing the flow, the current of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> towards that. May be more helpful to kind of feel or envisage a kind of _holding_ of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, of the object, in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Recap guided meditation - Metta to phenomena" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Recap guided meditation - Metta to phenomena" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-6

Should also say at this point, in a lot of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a></span> teachings, they dispense at one level with the words '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>' and '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>.' They just use one word, '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>,' to mean <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. So this morning in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditation</a></span>, I was actually going back and forth between using those words, and just to - not to confuse anyone. And you can use the phrases if that's helpful, you know. Again, we can go into this sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, just <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, the space of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> just being a very open door. And there's _complete_ welcoming, _complete_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span>. So what's being emphasized here is the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span>. Absolute, radical <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span>. Not, as in a usual vipassanā practice or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> practice, the precision, the clarity: "What exactly is going on? Can I see it moment to moment to moment?<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Emphasis was on complete acceptance" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Emphasis was on complete acceptance" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^3-7
###### 4-1
If we talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> practice, both those emphases are there - there's the emphasis on precision and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span>; oftentimes it's the precision that we tend to emphasize. So there's a reversal of that here. I'm not so interested in the precision, but we're really interested in the flow of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>, in the holding, in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span>, in the welcoming. Really emphasizing as complete as possible, a genuine welcoming of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, of the moment's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of the object in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, for its arising, for its staying, for its passing<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > With mindfulness practice theres both emphasis on precision and acceptence here more the welcoming of the experience" data-href="Love and Emptiness#With mindfulness practice there's both emphasis on precision and acceptence here more the welcoming of the experience" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-1
###### 4-2
And we can, as I say, we can direct the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, towards the object. Or, in a way, you can kind of feel like you're relaxing back into a space, a space of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, a space of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, a space that's imbued with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. And without forcing, the objects of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, whatever arises, is arising in that space. So sometimes in this practice, it will feel like, "Well, I can't feel any <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. There's just a sense of resistance" or whatever. But to remember: there can be a sense that there's nowhere outside of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span>. There's nowhere outside of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. So if we feel resistance, if we feel non-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span>, if we feel judging, if we feel numb - whatever it is, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, the space of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, can just be bigger, bigger than that, and see that, too, and embrace that, too, and bathe that, too, in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>, in the complete welcoming. And this welcoming has to be, this total welcoming has to be as genuine as possible. So as <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Ram Dass" class="internal-link">Ram Dass</a></span> says, if you're trying to accept something in order that it goes away, it has a way of knowing. [laughter] It knows, he says. So just to check that out. But if there is resistance, that too. Can take a step back and that, too, is included<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Relaxing back into a space of metta" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Relaxing back into a space of metta" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-2

So at first, if you're just hearing this, it might sound a little odd, but hopefully today you've had a little bit of a sense of this practice. It can be also we are opening up to the flow of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> inside, and we're just seeing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> coming and going, and coming and going. In a way, the very fleeting <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, in a way it deserves our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a></span> is almost nothing. It's poor. It's impoverished, in a way, and it needs our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. You could see it that way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > The fleeting nature of experience deserves our compassion" data-href="Love and Emptiness#The fleeting nature of experience deserves our compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-3
###### 4-4
So a question about this practice. Maybe I can even ask you now: what happens to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span> when they're there and we really bathe them or hold them in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>? What happens to mental states? What happens to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>, to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a></span>, to our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span> of things? So this really is a practice. It's very much a practice as much as <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> is a practice. But you may notice and you may have noticed today - I don't know, but you may have noticed today - that there's a way that things can kind of soften. That there's an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, there's a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> sensation or an emotion, and it just begins to soften. Its edges may begin to blur, begin to dissolve a little bit. It loses its definition. It may even begin to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span> somewhat. Did anyone notice anything like that at all today? Okay, some people. Good. [laughter] Phew! Otherwise we'd be straight back into [inaudible]<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Experience begin to fade" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Experience begin to fade" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-4
###### 4-5
Okay, what's going on here? What is going on here? This is very curious. This is a very curious <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomenon</a></span>. We could say, "What has this got to do with - I thought Buddhist practice and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> and vipassanā, I thought all that was about being with things as they are, and being in the moment, and being with what is and all that. And here I am doing this practice, and everything is kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a></span> or dissolving or losing its definition. That can't be right!" So again, to go back to something I said before, what practice is about is actually not about being with what is. It's not about being with things as they are or being in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="present moment" class="internal-link">present moment</a></span>. That's not what it's about. It's about - what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> keeps emphasizing - this balance of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span>, feeding what's beautiful, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> abiding, and investigation. The investigation, investigating into what brings <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> - which may, at times, take the form of "I'm just being with what is, what seems there in the moment." That's one avenue. But that can never be the main point of practice. The main point of practice is moving towards <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>, which is actually something different<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > The practice is not about being in the present moment but rather feeding whats beautiful and investigation" data-href="Love and Emptiness#The practice is not about being in the present moment but rather feeding what's beautiful and investigation" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-5
###### 5-1
How we move to that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>, whether it's through <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> or vipassanā or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, it's actually completely irrelevant and it doesn't matter at all. Different approaches, different times. Some people lean towards one or the other, but maybe one could say that knowing all approaches actually gives a fuller <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, I don't know. But certainly different approaches at different times<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > How we approach freedom doesnt matter - different approaches at different times" data-href="Love and Emptiness#How we approach freedom doesn't matter - different approaches at different times" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1
###### 5-2
So with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> practice, that we're, I think, more familiar with - vipassanā and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a></span> - there's an assumption there, that actually teachers are to blame for, which is that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> is neutral. There's something called <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>. There are objects in the world - sights, and sounds, and smells, and tastes, and touches, and thoughts, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>, and all that stuff - and then there's something called <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> which is there, and it sees it as it is. It sees things as they are in a way that's very neutral, very not involved, not active, not influencing. But is that really true? Is there really such a thing? So to think about outside our practice, we can see how much the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind state" class="internal-link">mind state</a></span> that we have at any time influences our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. We have this phrase, "seeing red," when we're really angry. Completely consumed in rage, and we say "seeing red." Actually, the very language is pointing to this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>: that our whole <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> is coloured through the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. Or as I'm sure you've noticed at least a little bit at times on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, sometimes there's just a feeling of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> there, and then what kind of world do we live in, what kind of world do we inhabit? Sometimes it's so strong it's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="heaven" class="internal-link">heaven</a></span> realm, it's so much changed the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > With insight meditation there is the assumption that mindfulness is neutral" data-href="Love and Emptiness#With insight meditation there is the assumption that mindfulness is neutral" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2
###### 5-3
So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> colours the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> colours the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. Sometimes when we're angry with someone else, we immediately rush to think, "I need to give <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> to this other person to sort of remedy the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>." Sometimes it's very interesting to actually give <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> to ourselves when we're angry with someone else. After all, we're probably feeling hurt, so we might need it. But it's quite interesting then, because when the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> to ourself begins to kick in, we can actually notice: there may be a change of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of the person, of the situation. Why? Because the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is then coloured with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. So <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> colours it, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> colours it, certainly <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="romantic love" class="internal-link">romantic love</a></span> colours it. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a></span> always has some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind state" class="internal-link">mind state</a></span>. So with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, there's always _some_ degree of something on the range from complete unconditioned bliss of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> to rage. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> will be somewhere along that spectrum. It _has_ to be<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > But the mind is coloroud with anger metta romantic love" data-href="Love and Emptiness#But the mind is coloroud with anger metta romantic love" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-3
###### 5-4
Even if it's very subtle, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> is always coloured by something on that spectrum, some degree of pushing an object away or pulling it towards us, or having a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> relationship with it or whatever. So there's a spectrum, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is always somewhere on that spectrum. Which amount of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> reveals the real object, reveals the way it really is? Anyone? [laughter] Who's going to say? There's always some degree there. Which amount reveals the real object? And we're noticing, in the practice, "Well, when there's a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> there, the object changes." It changes its form, its impression. What's the real object? What's this real world that we're referring to? What's this real moment, this real 'things as they are,' this real 'what is'? Is what is, what is? That's a question I want to ask. [laughter] Is what is, what is<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Theres a spectrum and the mind is always somewhere on that spectrum so what is real" data-href="Love and Emptiness#There's a spectrum and the mind is always somewhere on that spectrum so what is real" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^5-4
###### 6-1
So we say, "All right, maybe not <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>. What about that other word, '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>'? I've heard about that one. That must be the thing that's right there in the middle, at the perfect point. It even sounds like it, _equa_-, equa-something." But again, a deep practice of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, notice the same thing: the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of the object begins to change. It changes with the degree of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. And there's a similar kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a></span> with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. Things make less impression on <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> when there's a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> or a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. So we can definitely see this on the cushion and with this practice that we're doing now. You can see it with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a></span>, with painful <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a></span>, with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>, with whatever, absolutely. See it on the cushion in a very clear way. Can also see it off the cushion. This applies to our life too. Some situations where they're so pressing or we just can't stop thinking about them, when there's a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, I barely register, barely register the situation, or the importance of it anyway<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Things make less impression on consciousness when theres a lot of equanimity" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Things make less impression on consciousness when there's a lot of equanimity" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-1

Okay, so, about this practice, someone last year - I actually didn't have a name for it, and someone last year coined the name 'kindfulness,' which is quite nice. [laughter] It might be a little too cute for you; I don't know. It's a shorthand anyway. So what about it? A couple of things. One thing is it's skilful means. It's a real skilful means for ease, for ease in the present. And the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> was hugely interested in this, for people to find ways of relating to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="present moment" class="internal-link">present moment</a></span>, find ways of abiding, and even abiding with what is difficult, or what feels difficult, with ways that are easeful, with a sense of ease. So it's what the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> would call a 'skilful means' for ease in the moment. It's really important in our life, really important to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a></span> this practice so that there is that skill in means, able to abide skilfully with a sense of ease. So there's that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness >  Kindfulness is a skilful means for ease in the moment" data-href="Love and Emptiness# Kindfulness is a skilful means for ease in the moment" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-2
###### 6-3
But there are enormous <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span> here. Enormous <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span>. So the first one, at one level, is that it's the relationship with things, it's the relationship with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, that is important. So oftentimes, and sometimes in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> practice, sometimes we can be so much attending to the object - to the sensation or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span> or this or that or whatever - so much kind of caught up in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to the object that we forget, or we don't actually realize, what the relationship is. So basically - I mean, to put it very crudely - our relationship with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> is either peace or struggle, some degree of peace or some degree of struggle. Basically, that's it, in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> terms. We have a relationship of either peace with something or struggle<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Our relationship with experience is on a spectrum between peace or struggle" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Our relationship with experience is on a spectrum between peace or struggle" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-3

A relationship of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> is a relationship of peace. It's a relationship of peace with what's going on. And we begin to see that when the relationship is skilful, is one of ease, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> goes out of the thing. So it can be what it is, it can be unpleasant, it can be difficult, whatever, but the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> has gone out. So that's _hugely_ significant, to really, really know this, that some <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, some thing does not inherently have any problem to it. Problems are empty, we say in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> language, so a thing cannot be a problem, cannot be experienced as a problem unless I am in an unskilful relationship to it: I'm struggling with it, I'm pushing it, I'm pulling at it, whatever. And to see that: the thing, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, the object, etc., inner or outer, is not the problem, cannot be a problem by itself. It's empty of problem. Problem is empty.

Second one, and actually even deeper, is, again, this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of how things are. Even, sometimes - going back to what I said before - sometimes in the practice there are openings or there's a kind of melting going on. There's a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>. And it can feel relatively nondescript or whatever, but that's rare. Or it can feel completely mystically, cosmically <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>-blowing. And again, anywhere on that scale. There's a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>. But actually, what this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> into <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> is saying is that even <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> is not how things are. That's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. If you remember that note that I read out from the work retreatant about a sort of sense of dark, infinite space of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> that was kind of holding everything and accommodating everything that she opened up to - even that sense, beautiful, cosmic sense of infinite, eternal <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> that's, whatever you want to say, woven into the fabric of the universe - that arises when the conditions are there. When the conditions are not there, it won't be there. Same with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Even oneness is not how things really are its also dependend on conditions" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Even oneness is not how things really are it's also dependend on conditions" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-1

<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a></span> of how things are. They're not separate. They're not one. They're not however. But I feel it's really, really important to say here: sometimes, often I think, what we hear in teachings is, "Don't get attached to a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>. Don't get attached to that sense of vast <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> holding everything, if that opens up, because that's just a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. It just arises from conditions." And then we say, "Okay, I'll let go of that, whatever." Don't be in a hurry. If this is part of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, really not to be in a hurry to let go of that kind of thing. The power of those kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span> to transform the heart and transform the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> over time is enormous, absolutely enormous. And if we hurry through, and just say, "Oh, just a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. It's just conditions, just a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>," where do we go? We actually just go straight back to the default <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, which is "I'm sitting here giving a talk, and you're trying to stay awake" or whatever it is. [laughter] That's the default. Human <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> is programmed incredibly strongly to go to that default mode. What we begin to see in practice is that default <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of seeing</a></span> is not the reality. If we throw out what I would call the deeper senses of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>, of an infinite <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, whatever you want to call it, if we throw that out too quickly, we just go back to the default, and in a way, we're not challenging that default mode enough<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > But dont be in a hurry as the power of those kinds of perceptions transforms heart and mind" data-href="Love and Emptiness#But don't be in a hurry as the power of those kinds of perceptions transforms heart and mind" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-2

So there's a line. I don't know; it's curious. I'm not sure how many people even notice this - maybe people do, but - this is the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta Sutta" data-href="Metta Sutta" class="internal-link">Mettā Sutta</a></span>, and towards the end, it basically is a description of how <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> leads to complete <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>.

So truth, in a way, all we can say is that the truth of things is that they're empty. To say they exist is a little - you know, when we begin practising this way, it's actually a little bit problematic. To say they don't exist at all is also problematic. So the truth of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> is actually something - it's called the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span>, meaning it's not existence and it's not non-existence, and nor is it some kind of compromise ("Well, they sort of, half the time they …" whatever).

So to begin - and that's what we're doing; we're just beginning this, because it's extremely deep and it's really, I'd say, it's a lifetime's journey, this questioning, this looking.

We can see it in our practice, and we can see it on all kinds of levels. So we can also see it outside our practice. Or one might come to a situation like this, and here we are. You think, "Three weeks at <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a></span>, right. I'm really going to get my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span> together. I'm going to really quieten the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>" or whatever. And then one comes, and someone's fidgeting next to you or whatever, or coughing or whatever it is, and you say, "How am I supposed to …?!" You know, I've arrived at the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">meditation centre</a></span> with this view - again, I've said it in another talk - of _what I want_. And then that begins to colour everything. We view the situation through _what I want_. So we can play with this. What happens if I come into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> hall, and here are all these, you know, irritating people again [laughs], or one particular person, and one says, "This person is giving me the opportunity to practise patience, to practise <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>," whatever? And see if one can actually genuinely make that shift, and see the situation differently. And then it's a gift, their presence and whatever it is they're doing<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Example What I want colouring the meditation practice" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Example What I want colouring the meditation practice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-2

And if you're kind of really adventurous and bold, you can come in and sit down and have a view, "Actually, I'm not here for <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>. All I'm here to do is to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> you. That's all. I'm just here to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> you." That's very advanced practice! [laughter] So what we notice is, if we change the view, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> changes. The irritability goes from the situation. How we see the situation and how we see a person depends on what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is bringing to it - <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, irritability, what I want, whatever it is.

Okay, we're going to look at this from a different angle. To go back to - I was talking about last week or whenever it was - about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. When there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, we tend to think, "Here's a thing, an event, or a situation that I'm fearful of. And there's the thing and the event, and then there's my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>." And we tend to view them as separate: the thing, the event, the situation, and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. They're separate. Independent, existing independent. And we can see that in any way - there's any kind of object, and the reaction to it. But we can really see - <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>'s good because it's quite clear, like <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> - the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> colours our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of the object. So we begin to see, you know, an ogre in the shadows when there's nothing there. There's nothing. In a way, that's obvious: <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> colours the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of the object. But we also need reminding of that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Fear is not existing independently but also dependend on the reaction to it" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Fear is not existing independently but also dependend on the reaction to it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-4
###### 8-5
I think I also said when I was talking about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is almost always about future, caught up with future thoughts. If I believe in a present, in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="present moment" class="internal-link">present moment</a></span> that somehow exists in a real, independent way, that has its own inherent existence, independent of what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and the heart is bringing to it - if I believe in the present, in a 'what is,' in a 'here and now' that's like that - if I believe in this present thing having some independent existence, then to borrow an analogy of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s, "as sure as the wheels of the cart follow the ox that pulls it," there will be <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of the future. If I believe in the present being something real, independent of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, there will be <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of the future, because I'm believing in a present<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > If I believe in the present as something real independent of the mind there will be fear of the future" data-href="Love and Emptiness#If I believe in the present as something real independent of the mind there will be fear of the future" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-5
###### 9-1
So can we again see: present is empty, because it depends on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind state" class="internal-link">mind state</a></span>. It depends on what's there with the seeing. Past is empty. When we look back on the past, you look back at past romances or whatever, and sometimes it's, "Oh, that was nice. She was a really special one." [laughter] And other times, you look back and you think, "_Pfff,_" y_ou_ know. Or on our education. If I think back on my time in school, sometimes it seems, "God, that was really pressured and there was a lot of cruelty around." And other times, "God, I really had a laugh, you know." Or whatever. The past is coloured by the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind state" data-href="Mind state" class="internal-link">present mind state</a></span>. What's the real past? What's the independently existing past? Present is empty. Past is empty. Future is the same. Apart from not actually _existing_ - where is it? - when it becomes present, it will become present, and it will be empty. If I don't really believe in the present, I can't really believe in the future, and I can't really believe in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. I can't really believe in the power of that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Past present and future are empty" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Past present and future are empty" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-1

So going back to this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aksayamati Sutra" data-href="Aksayamati Sutra" class="internal-link">Akṣayamati Sūtra</a></span>: "For those who are further advanced on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is based on dharmas."

"For those who have seen into <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is not based on anything." I just want to touch very briefly on this. This appears in other texts and traditions. So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Rumi" class="internal-link">Rumi</a></span>, the Sufi mystical poet, has a poem. I can't remember the poem. "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a></span> without an object," and something he says, "is the best kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>." And in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tibetan Buddhism" data-href="Tibetan Buddhism" class="internal-link">Tibetan traditions</a></span>, the Tibetan <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a></span> traditions and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vajrayana" data-href="Vajrayana" class="internal-link">Vajrayāna</a></span> traditions, talk about “<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> without any object of reference.” And they talk about this being the very best of all paths, without any danger points. No danger of being disconnected and indifferent towards beings or anything like that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Compassion without any object of reference in the traditions" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Compassion without any object of reference in the traditions" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-2

And so I just want, very briefly - what does this mean, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> without an object? So it's actually gone beyond the sense even of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> to all things, to all beings, to all objects. It's actually something on a whole different level. And it comes, glimpses of it come or whatever, when there's very deep opening to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. Or can come then. But I just wanted to mention that as a possibility, and just to drop in - I think maybe it's too late now on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, but it's sometimes interesting, I think, to notice the reaction when someone is talking or you read or whatever and it seems, "Oh, I'm really not there yet. I don't know what that is. That's way beyond me." Just to notice the reaction. Do we close down? Do we turn off? Do we immediately grasp at that and decide, "Well, my experiences I'm not interested in at all. I want _that_"? Or do we think, "Oh, I'm a complete failure"? Just to notice what goes on<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Do we close down when we feel something is beyond us" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Do we close down when we feel something is beyond us" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-3

And in its depths, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, in a way, like <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a></span>.

So again, the first level of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, when there's no <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a></span> - and I think this probably goes back to what John was saying about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dependent origination" class="internal-link">dependent origination</a></span> - the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, when that's there, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> comes, and we can look at that link in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span>, relax the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, relax the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, relax the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>. and we feel the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> go out of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>.

What we begin to see is that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> makes the way the world appears.

So when we're practising <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> at a very deep level towards objects, there's this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a></span>, and there's a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a></span>, because objects, for their existence, need to be grasped at. They need to have some kind of tussle going on with them, either for or against or whatever. So this is completely counterintuitive. We tend to think, "Well, of course an object exists. It doesn't need me to do anything to it." But we begin to see: the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a></span> of something depends on the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>.

In the depths of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, there is this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a></span>. And we can also see, you know, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> clouds our seeing. And this is very clear in ourselves and in others. When there's a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>, we actually don't see clearly.

Seeing more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> brings with it <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. It's an inevitable outcome of seeing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>: <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. If I think I'm seeing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, but it's _not_ leading to a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> or relief or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> or peace or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, then there's something a little askew in the way we're seeing or in our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>.

Seeing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> leads to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, because it's kind of done away with the reality of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a></span>, with the reality of barriers, with the reality of real problems, real faults, with the investment we have in self-inflating or self-depreciation<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > The indicator for emptiness is love and freedom" data-href="Love and Emptiness#The indicator for emptiness is love and freedom" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-4

And eventually - as I said, we're just beginning here - but eventually where the practice goes is, we begin to see it's all empty. It's all empty. And this isn't <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nihilism" data-href="Nihilism" class="internal-link">nihilistic</a></span> at all. There's something very beautiful in this. So self is empty, selves are empty, things are empty, inner things, outer things (so-called). Begin to also see minds are empty. And actually <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is empty too. All of it, all of it, all of it. And somehow, kind of mysteriously, or even paradoxically, seeing even that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> [doesn't really exist], that beings who suffer don't really exist, somehow it leads to even more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Paradoxically seeing that even that suffering doesnt really exist somehow leads to even more love and compassion" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Paradoxically seeing that even that suffering doesn't really exist somehow leads to even more love and compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-5

So listening to that, you know, again, it may sound completely abstract or far removed or whatever. But this is a very real possibility, I'm talking about something very real that's possible for everyone, everyone in the room. We tend to think about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>, or we hear about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a></span>, and people's accounts, and this and that, and we tend to think, you know, one day I'll be either sitting in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> - or _not_ sitting in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>, if that's our view, that it never happens in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>, it only happens in supermarkets or whatever - and then there'll be this thunderbolt and that will be it. And it will just be over in a flash, and bada-bing, bada-boom, end of el problemo! [laughter] I don't know that it works that way. Maybe for a few people, I don't know. Really I think it's something that we go deeper and deeper, slowly, gradually, usually in a non-linear way, into this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. And little by little, it becomes clearer and clearer, a more and more full <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, and deeper and deeper. And it is, it is, it is a very real possibility. As a teacher, I'm just not interested in talking about anything abstract. Just, what's the point? So I'm talking about something very real, that's genuinely possible. Even if it feels right now that, you know, "I can't relate.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Its something that we go deeper slowly gradually in a non-linear way" data-href="Love and Emptiness#It's something that we go deeper slowly gradually in a non-linear way" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^10-6
###### 11-1
And so, just finally, when we talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, when we talk about the kind of scope and the range of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, we may already very clearly have a sense in our own practice that there are levels of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, we could say, or a continuum of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. And we as human beings, our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, our heart, moves along that continuum. That's the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of being human. And there's a kind of humility in that, that it _will_ move along this continuum. So sometimes we cannot find a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, we cannot find any feeling there. All we can do is the very basic thing of planting the seeds of intention, planting the seeds of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And that intentionality is an act of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, even if there's no feeling, it feels dry as a bone, or even angry or whatever. And sometimes it goes through all the levels that I've mentioned, to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> without an object. But again, it's not that we're always going to stay in one state or another. It's something about being human, the amazing range of human <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>. It's staggering, the capacity of the range of human <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> to move along that whole spectrum. And somehow in that, and in accepting that movement, that's where our humanity is and our humility is<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > A continuum of love" data-href="Love and Emptiness#A continuum of love" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-1

###### 11-6
Rob: Yeah. You can. Yeah, okay. Did everyone hear that? You can do that. In a way, there are a couple of different things that could be going on there. One is giving the tree <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> as a tree, as a perhaps sentient being - I don't know. And that's one level. And that would come under <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> towards beings still. But then there's another level, or another slight emphasis on practice, which we're now moving to a bit more, which is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> to the sight, so to that impression in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> as a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dharma" class="internal-link">dharma</a></span>, as an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, and whatever is there, clouds or whatever. Yeah, you can absolutely do that. You can experiment with this, but you may find that seeing the kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span> that I've been talking about will probably be clearer when you're doing it towards things like <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> and thoughts and that kind of stuff internally. But it's interesting what happens when you do it also towards sound and towards sight. So experiment. What I think _I'm_ interested in is beginning to see this relationship. So don't always go where perhaps the relationship is harder to see. Spend some time where you really begin to see, "Ah, there's something going on here." Does that make sense<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob Yes and possibilities" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob Yes and possibilities" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^11-6

Yogi 2: When John was explaining <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> in this way, he was talking about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a></span> being processes like, you know, considering all the conditions that brought them together to being here, and what will take them apart in the future.

###### 12-6
Rob: Yeah, sure. So that would - and in the course of doing that, you began to notice that the relationship was a factor? Is that what you're saying? That's fine. I mean, I think that would correlate with, I can't remember which talk I gave, but maybe two back, when I was talking about bringing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span> into the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice. So actually seeing something is transient, or seeing it as empty and dependent on conditions, and then giving the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> towards that. But yeah, that's fine. The relationship can become clear that way. There's something about noticing how influential the inner relationship with something is, and especially because we've been doing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, it's already current at that, and using that current to make an effect on <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. It can be really clear, and then it's undeniably clear that there's a relationship. It's very clear. That's all. But any way that it happens, it's great. I would say try doing it the other way round, so just that, and seeing if you can notice it that way too. Does that answer<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob Theres something about noticing how influential the inner relationship with something ist" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob There's something about noticing how influential the inner relationship with something ist" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^12-6

**Q3: clarification about what to practise, practice schedules; the spectrum and blending of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Compassion" data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">karuṇā</a></span>** ^13-8
###### 13-9
Yogi: Just a question for the instruction this morning. I understood you to say that we're in some way to use both the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Compassion" data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">karuṇā</a></span> and the practice of sort of a bit of one or another. ^13-9
###### 13-10
Rob: I should go over that again. What I'm suggesting for this final week is to choose two practices: either the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and this new practice, or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and this new practice. Now, what you may want to do is really emphasize the new practice and just do a little bit of either the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> or the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Or you may want to just really emphasize the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> or the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and a little bit of the new practice. Or half and half. The balance, I don't <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> so much about. I think the only thing really in there is maybe not at this point to mix the pure <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and the pure <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice. Okay? That's the only combination that's not … Within this new practice, sometimes it will feel more like <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> towards <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, objects; sometimes it will feel more like <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>; sometimes it will just feel like <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span>. That's where it doesn't really matter. It's just words, and just to go with whatever seems helpful with that. Okay<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness >  Rob For now do not mix pure metta and pure compassion practice" data-href="Love and Emptiness# Rob For now do not mix pure metta and pure compassion practice" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^13-10
###### 13-11
Yogi 2: I'm finding it really hard to understand how you can't mix <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Compassion" data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">karuṇā</a></span>. Because in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Compassion" data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">karuṇā</a></span> or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, you're having to do <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span> with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. There is a degree of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> there. So I get confused when you say don't mix them<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Yogi But isnt there a degree of metta in karuna practice" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Yogi But isn't there a degree of metta in karuna practice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-11
###### 14-1
Rob: Yeah. The <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice, they will at times - at times, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> seems so much like <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and at times <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, you know, when there's not a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, it feels very much like <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. So there is a spectrum there, and they kind of tend to blend. Just to reiterate, then: the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice, it tunes into <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. It just hones into the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, that resonance of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. And it stays there with that, receptive to that, sensitive to that, and then addresses that with what goes out, with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span>. Now, sometimes that will _feel_ more like a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice, and sometimes less so, but the point is that it's receptive to, sensitive to, and directed to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. That's all. That they feel similar and that they involve each other - don't worry about that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob Compassion practice tunes into suffering and the outgoing healing can feel like metta" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob Compassion practice tunes into suffering and the outgoing healing can feel like metta" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-1
###### 14-2
Yogi 2: I can see better now the distinction. I'm also thinking, with this new practice, you're saying do one or the other - do you mean do one or the other at any one time, or throughout the week? ^14-2
###### 14-3
Rob: I mean throughout the week, take two practices now, one being <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> … ^14-3
###### 14-4
Yogi 2: So kind of choose it now and stay with it? Because … ^14-4
###### 14-5
Rob: I'd say choose it by lunchtime tomorrow. How's that? [laughter] And you know, with all these practices, we're just beginning here. You've got the rest of your life to explore it, three practices which are huge in range, huge in scope, and profound, profound, profound. So just, it's fine whatever you choose here. It's fine.

###### 14-7
Yogi: A couple of things you said in the talk came together for me when we sat in silence, about how <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> can kind of hold the experiences [?] other experiences can happen. As I sat, I felt my fingers were numb. So I went in and I met that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>: what does this feel like? Then I checked out my reaction to that: am I not liking it? And then I brought in a sense of just bringing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span> toward all of that. Does that seem, that kind of sequential way of doing things, is that a valid way …<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Q4 noticing reaction then giving mettā vs just giving mettā straight" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Q4 noticing reaction then giving mettā vs just giving mettā straight" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^14-7
###### 14-8
Rob: Yeah, absolutely. Or you could eventually, if you'd been with us there would have been quite a current of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> by now, and you could kind of skip the middle one, just bothering to even see what your reaction is - just dump the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> on. [laughter] So you could skip that. Also, what will happen with practice is you get very quick at doing it. So it's just whatever's in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, whatever's prominent, there the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> goes. And also quite quick to see what the relationship with things is. With practice, it just becomes very evident: there's some slight <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> here. And it's clear, and then the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> comes in or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> or whatever. But what you're describing is great. It's really great<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob Both sensible and youll get very quick at doing it either way" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob Both sensible and you'll get very quick at doing it either way" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-8

**Q5: <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> is a part of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>** ^14-9
###### 15-1
Yogi: And another thing, if that's okay. You said about how for something to exist there has to be <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>. Is an example of that, if my eyes are open, and I'm seeing lots of light, but I'm not seeing [?] until I actually go and grasp it? It doesn't even actually exist for me until I see it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Yogi Grasping as actually grasping it" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Yogi Grasping as actually grasping it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-1
###### 15-2
Rob: When this gets very subtle, an analogy is that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> is kind of like prongs, calipers - it does _that._ And to see you now, I'm kind of … [laughter] It goes on in a very subtle way. There's a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> that goes on with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>. But we can also see that we can be paying <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to something, and then when we let go of a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>, that thing that we're paying <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to actually begins to blur and to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span>. So it can be easier to see with the eyes closed and working with internal things, but eventually it's actually possible with your eyes open and with sound and everything. So <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> comes into <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Grasping</a></span> is _part_ of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, put it that way. It's part of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. No <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>, no <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. But it's extremely subtle. In <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, there is a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> to. That's great<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob attention is kind of like prongs" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob attention is kind of like prongs" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-2

###### 15-7
Rob: [laughs] This is actually one of those really odd questions. Did everyone hear the question? ^15-7
###### 15-8
Yogi 2: No. ^15-8
###### 15-9
Rob: If a person's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightened</a></span>, they're not supposed to be <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>, so how come they're not bumping into walls all the time? [laughter] At first, it can seem like an abstract question, but as one goes into this practice and you really see no <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>, no <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, it becomes a very real question: "I thought awakened people were not supposed to grasp." I've asked a number of people this question. [laughter] So a couple of things. One of my teachers, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Thanissaro Bhikkhu" data-href="Thanissaro Bhikkhu" class="internal-link">Ajaan Ṭhānissaro</a></span>, he said, "I don't know. Ask an <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">arahant</a></span>." [laughter] Which I thought was a perfectly valid answer. In the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tibetan Buddhism" data-href="Tibetan Buddhism" class="internal-link">Tibetan tradition</a></span>, which I think, it sounds weird when you first hear it, but when you really go into practice, you see, "Well, maybe there's really something to this," only a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>, only a fully <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightened</a></span> person can actually see the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of something and perceive it at the same time. No other beings can do that. Either you're noticing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of something, in which case it fades, or you're considering it real, in which case it's there. My take on it, as well, is that a person can be awakened to some degree, and there's basically a momentum of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sankhara" data-href="Sankhara" class="internal-link">saṅkhāras</a></span>, of karmic momentum, to basically perceive things and things existing really. And that momentum for the duration of their life is enough to keep the world <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearing</a></span> for them. And then, theoretically, when they die, it all kind of dissolves into whatever it does. Again, that can seem completely irrelevant and abstract, but as one goes deeper into practice, it becomes like, "Hmm. What is going on here? How would that work?" Yeah. Okay<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob Maybe only Buddhas can see emptiness and not bump into things" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob Maybe only Buddhas can see emptiness and not bump into things" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^15-9

**Q7: describing meditative states as '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>'** ^16-3
###### 16-4
Yogi: Just to make sure that I understood completely … well, not completely, but a little better. When you talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, you're not talking about a thing; you're talking about a concept which says that nothing exists in and of itself? It only exists because of all of the conditions that arise that lead to its arising<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Yogi Is emptiness the concept that nothing exists in and of itself" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Yogi Is emptiness the concept that nothing exists in and of itself" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^16-4
###### 16-5
Rob: And it doesn't exist in any real, independent way. I cannot say how a thing is, because of what I said. And even for a thing to arise, it needs me to be _making_ it somehow. In that way, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> is a concept, or even an adjective: things are empty. What we can also talk about, in practice terms, is states of relative <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. So it's using the word a little bit incorrectly, but it's valid. So there are degrees of very deep <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> we can talk about. That's a state that comes about with a certain level of seeing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> and then another state of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. And you can talk about that too. But <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> as a thing, strictly speaking, no, it's not really a thing. What you could also talk about is the complete <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a></span> of everything - all <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, all notion of time, all notion of subject, object, anything at all, self, thing, etc. Complete <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a></span> of everything. And what's left there, if you can even speak that way, you could talk about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a></span> with a big E, or _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">nirvāṇa</a></span>,_ or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a></span>, or whatever language you want. So some people use it that way as well. But that's not really a thing either. Language is really stopped way short of that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob That I cannot say how a thing is that is the meaning of emptiness" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob That I cannot say how a thing is that is the meaning of emptiness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-5

Yogi: Say in states when there is really no sense of separate self, there's still <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. So that would be a condition … ^16-6

Rob: It would be a condition, because there's still some object that's existing. At first, what can happen when we go into those kind of states, we think, "Well, everything's disappeared." But actually, looking again, you see, "No, there's still a subtle sense of something or other," even a sense of nothingness or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> or time or whatever. So it's just this progressive deconstructing, in a way, you could say<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob progressive deconstrucing" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob progressive deconstrucing" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-7
###### 16-8
Yogi: The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> you were talking about previously, there is no object in that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. Where there's no time, no <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span>, no - that's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> without an object<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Yogi awareness without an object" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Yogi awareness without an object" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-8
###### 16-9
Rob: You could, some people use that word, '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> without an object.' Some people prefer to say, "Well, actually even there's no <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> there, because you can't really call it <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>." Again, like I said, the language is stopped short. It's gone beyond language, so it's difficult<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob Language is stopped short" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob Language is stopped short" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-9

**Q8: clarification about what to practise (2)** ^17-1
###### 17-2
Yogi: On the choice of the practice for the week, we choose <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> together with this new kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. If I understand, the main difference is that we're sending <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to dharmas or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span> or experiences rather than to beings. So we can experiment, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> for a person we have in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> for the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> in our knee<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Yogi 2 practices sending metta to persons and to dharmas new" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Yogi 2 practices sending metta to persons and to dharmas new" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-2
###### 17-3
Rob: Yeah. And what I would do is actually be conscious of when you're in one practice and when you're in the other. So, you know, say this sitting would be <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> towards beings, and then another sitting <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> towards objects of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> or whatever. Maybe halfway through a sitting, you may feel, "Now I want to switch the practice," and that's fine too. But just to be clear which one you're doing, what will help with that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob You can switch in a sitting but be clear which one youre doing" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob You can switch in a sitting but be clear which one you're doing" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-3
###### 17-4
Yogi: So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> - we should practise this alternative sense of the object of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. ^17-4
###### 17-5
Rob: Sense of relation with the object, yeah. Good. Is that clear? Maybe the last one<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob New practice is directing metta or compassion to the sense of relation with the object" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob New practice is directing metta or compassion to the sense of relation with the object" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-5
###### 17-6
**Q9: why differentiate between <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>** ^17-6
###### 17-7
Yogi: Carrying on with [?]. Often if I'm practising, say I'm practising <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> to [?], and in that practice the thought of some <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in that being just brings them to my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, it shoots into <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. ^17-7
###### 17-8
Rob: It does. ^17-8
###### 17-9
Yogi: And vice versa. I'm practising <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> for someone, for their <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and something joyful appears. I remember last year you were emphasizing what's important is to be able to distinguish the two sentiments as different from each other. If you can do that, couldn't you free it up a little bit? It doesn't make sense to me to be so rigid; it blocks the flow. ^17-9
###### 17-10
Rob: [long pause] Okay. [laughter] Sure, yeah. Go for it. If that's what feels helpful, just do it. As I said, they will blend and bleed into each other. There is something that comes with just really developing one and staying with one and letting that go through its range, just having one kind of intention. One level, they do blend into each other, and they're mixed, and it's kind of all the same thing anyway; why bother making a difference? On another level, we do want to be - there's a slight difference, and we want to be sensitive to it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob They blend into each other but we want to be sensitive to slight differences" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob They blend into each other but we want to be sensitive to slight differences" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-10
###### 17-11
Yogi: [?] What I said was that I will notice the shift while I'm practising that. My sentiment actually changes depending how the object changes for me. ^17-11
###### 18-1
Rob: Yeah, sure. And that's good, and that would be part of either a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice or a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, to notice when it's actually more like - say a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> practice feels more like a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice, or a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice feels more like a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. That would be part of developing each one. I'm just saying maybe, maybe there's something that comes out of just staying with one deliberately, and seeing it go through that range, and noticing it change colour as part of the practice, but just staying with one strand of intention. But I'm not going to be anal about it, so whatever. Okay<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob staying with a particular strand of intention" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob staying with a particular strand of intention" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^18-1

**Q10: too many dharmas to give <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> to** ^18-2
###### 18-3
Yogi: Sometimes there are a lot of objects coming up in this new practice. And it seems kind of difficult to be directing the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, or it seems like there's a sense of hurry<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Yogi Many objects hurrying towards me makes it difficult to direct metta" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Yogi Many objects hurrying towards me makes it difficult to direct metta" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^18-3
###### 18-4
Rob: I would just maybe choose what's prominent and stay with that. You're just interested in, again, a skilful abiding, and seeing this relationship. Sometimes maybe a lot of objects are coming up, and it might be worth seeing: what's the feeling with a lot of objects coming up? Is there a feeling of "ugh," or agitation, or hurriedness or whatever? And actually giving _that_, because that will be a bit more steady, then giving _that_ the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. Okay? So finding one thing that's a bit more steady and doing that. Okay? Great<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob Finding one thing thats a bit more steady and doing it" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob Finding one thing that's a bit more steady and doing it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^18-4
