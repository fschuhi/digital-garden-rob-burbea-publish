## Paragraphs
[[Equanimity in Compassion -|plain list]]

##### Equanimity is the fourth of the brahmaviharas
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^1-1" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^1-1" class="internal-link">1-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> (2) · <a data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">Brahmaviharas</a> (2) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Catherine McGee" class="internal-link">Catherine McGee</a> · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12289/20070208-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity_in_compassion-12289.mp3#t=00:05" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Okay, so today I want to talk about <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> - it's the fourth of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a> - and specifically I want to talk about <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> and its relation to <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> (actually, maybe broaden it out if we have time). So as you know, there are these four <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a>, four divine or sublime abidings, dwellings of the heart, and we've been working mostly on the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> (the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>), the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> (<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Compassion" data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">karuṇā</a>). <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Catherine McGee" data-href="Catherine McGee" class="internal-link">Catherine</a>, I think - Monday, or one day - talked about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, which is the third one.</span>

---
##### Mudita is usually translated as "sympathetic joy"
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^1-2" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">Mudita</a> (4) · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12289/20070208-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity_in_compassion-12289.mp3#t=00:54" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And just a word about that: usually, that third brahmavihāra gets translated - the Pali word is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">muditā</a> - usually it gets translated as '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">sympathetic joy</a>,' which has the meaning of, if someone is happy, if some good circumstance befalls someone, something happens in their life to make them happy, then instead of being jealous or indifferent, we are happy for their <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>. We're happy for them to be happy. And that's the usual way that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">muditā</a> is translated, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">sympathetic joy</a>.</span>

---
##### Mudita is a kind of joy that's not so based on the ego
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^1-3" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Commentaries" class="internal-link">Commentaries</a> · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">Mudita</a> (3) · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (4) · <a data-href="Wonder" class="internal-link">Wonder</a> (2) · <a data-href="Nature" class="internal-link">Nature</a> · <a data-href="Receptivity" class="internal-link">Receptivity</a> · <a data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">Beauty</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12289/20070208-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity_in_compassion-12289.mp3#t=01:44" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">I think that translation actually came from the <a data-href="commentaries" class="internal-link">commentaries</a>, and in the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s original discourses, I'm not sure that he used it that way. The meaning that I prefer is more something like '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">spiritual joy</a>,' which isn't a great word, I know, but what it really to me means is a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, a <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> in life that's not dependent on the ego getting something, or being pumped up by something, or inflated, or feeling superior or whatever. So a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> in life that is not about the ego getting. And then, of course, as a sort of small piece of that, there will be <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">sympathetic joy</a>. When someone else is happy, I will be happy as well, as a piece of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">spiritual joy</a>. But it would also include things like <a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a> at <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a>, like that kind of <a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a> that I was talking about, like an openness to be touched by life, and touched by the <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a>, the awe, the <a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a> of life, in a way that I can't own, I can't possess it; it has nothing to do with me. It has nothing to do with me being great, or giving me anything particularly. So some kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> that's not so based on the ego. That's the third one.</span>

##### Equanimity is not a word we use much in English
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^1-4" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12289/20070208-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity_in_compassion-12289.mp3#t=03:17" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And then the fourth one is this word '<a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>.' The Pali word is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity" data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">upekkhā</a>. And this is a strange word. It's not a word we use much in English. And again, if you wandered down Newton Abbot high street and you asked people, you know, "How often do you feel equanimous?" or whatever, you'd probably get some puzzled looks! [laughter] It's not a very common word. And sometimes it can be hard to understand what it actually means.</span>

##### The heart and mind stay steady through their contact with all things in life
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^1-5" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^1-5" class="internal-link">1-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">Steadiness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (3) · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12289/20070208-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity_in_compassion-12289.mp3#t=04:04" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">It's a kind of <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a>, a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness of the heart</a> and the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>. And again, there are two kinds of meanings. One is in relation to all things, so the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, the heart, the being, stays steady, stays balanced, stays kind of unshakeable through its contact with all things in life. So in relation to whatever comes, however difficult, however wonderful, the heart, the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, stays steady, stays upright, stays balanced. And that's the broader meaning of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, and the way that the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> more often used it.</span>

---
##### Equanimity makes the compassion steady in the face of suffering
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^1-6" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^1-6" class="internal-link">1-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Commentaries" class="internal-link">Commentaries</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (4) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (7) · <a data-href="Depression" class="internal-link">Depression</a> · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12289/20070208-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity_in_compassion-12289.mp3#t=04:49" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And again, I think through the <a data-href="commentaries" class="internal-link">commentaries</a>, it has come to have a kind of second meaning in relationship to beings - so specifically as a kind of balancing factor in terms of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. Here we are cultivating <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> and opening the heart, sensitizing the heart to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the world, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> of others, and our own, and sometimes acting in the world to try and alleviate the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, to be of service, to be of help. And yet, what we often find is that the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> of others is _not_ alleviated. It's not helped. There's still <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> for whatever reasons. Or there's just _too much_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the world. It's actually endless. It's impossible for me to end all the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the world. Can the heart stay steady with that? Can the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> stay steady, so that we're not keeled over, bowled over, closing down or feeling <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Depression" data-href="Depression" class="internal-link">depressed</a> by that? So in relationship to beings, this is what <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> means. It's a hugely important factor in <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>.</span>

##### This talk is about how equanimity feeds into the compassion practice
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^2-1" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12289/20070208-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity_in_compassion-12289.mp3#t=06:07" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">I want to just go into a little bit how that factor of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> feeds into the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practice, how we can develop it within the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practice, and then broaden it out. Some of it, we've already touched on, but I just want to draw it out once more.</span>

---
##### (1) Opening the heart to resonate with the suffering we see (empathy)
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^2-2" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Empathy" class="internal-link">Empathy</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12289/20070208-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity_in_compassion-12289.mp3#t=06:28" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">The first aspect is (which I've said a couple of times at least) - in the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practice, it has two elements. One is this, what I would call '<a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a>.' We are opening the heart to receive, to resonate with, to sympathize with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> that we see. So I see sorrow, and something in the heart trembles with that sorrow, it resonates with that sorrow. Somehow, I don't know - mystically, almost - sorrow that isn't ours, we witness it, and something happens in our heart. Our heart vibrates sympathetically with that.</span>

---
##### (2) Wanting to heal the suffering (energy)
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^2-3" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> · <a data-href="Grief" class="internal-link">Grief</a> · <a data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">Beauty</a> · <a data-href="Healing" class="internal-link">Healing</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12289/20070208-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity_in_compassion-12289.mp3#t=07:15" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">That's only half of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. The other half is this <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>, this intention that comes out of the being, so to speak, that goes out of the being, that wants to heal, wants to alleviate and soothe that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, wants to comfort it. In the practice, we can actually feel where the balance is in any one moment. ==So sometimes it will feel like we're very much in the 'feeling the sorrow' side, where very much there's quite some sadness, or <a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a>, or just being moved. And sometimes it can be very lovely, and there's a sweetness to it, there's a <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a> to it; the heart is open and touched. And sometimes it feels like the balance is more, we're just feeling in, tuning into that <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> that's going out - the lovely quality of <a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a>, of light, the balm, the comforting.==</span>

---
##### The outflow of compassion from us to others touches us, and we feel healed
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^2-4" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^2-4" class="internal-link">2-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Healing" class="internal-link">Healing</a> (3) · <a data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">Pleasantness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12289/20070208-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity_in_compassion-12289.mp3#t=08:13" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">This is a balance that's always moving. It's always moving. So part of the practice is to be aware of, in any one moment, where the balance is. If we're tuning into that healing quality, what's going out, the comforting, the balm, it actually has a feeling of feeling pleasant, and of feeling quite healing. So in coming out of _our_ being, it's actually touching us on its way out to others. And we feel healed. And there's a kind of pleasantness in it. There's a kind of brightness in it. There's a kind of healing in it. And there's even a kind of sense of well-being, of happiness in it.</span>

<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
What's going out, the comforting, the balm, it actually has a feeling of feeling pleasant, and of feeling quite healing. So in coming out of our being, it's actually touching us on its way out to others. And we feel healed.<br/>

##### There can be a lot of grief in the compassion practice about the immensity and universality of suffering

<span class="paragraph">So sometimes there are times, and periods, even, when there's a lot of <a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a>. There's a lot of <a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a>, almost, in the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practice. Something in the heart is opening, and it's almost like a veil - we're removing a veil, and the heart just comes in a very raw contact with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> of the world. We see, like a veil has been removed from the eyes, from the heart, and we're touching directly the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the world. We see the immensity of it. We see the universality of it, the fact of <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a>, the fact of change, the fact of disease, the fact of all of it.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And the heart can, in that - there is a grief, and there can be tears and sorrow and a real being touched at a very deep level, which in a way is important. For some people, that will be there at times, and it's part of the heart opening. It's not everyone that goes through something like that, but it can be there at times, very subtly, or more strongly. And in a way, it's part of our humanity to be touched. We're not, in a way, wanting to be untouched and inhuman. It gives the heart a quality of some kind of opening, some kind of tenderness that's really important.</span>

##### Equanimity means  buoyancy, not to sink underneath the weight of the suffering

<span class="paragraph">But we need to really be conscious of this balance in our practice of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. And I would say that in order that <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> in our life is something sustainable - in other words, we really feel like we can practise <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> all day every day for the rest of our lives, and not feel tired, not feel overwhelmed, not feel burdened by the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the world - we need to keep tuning into that loveliness of what's going out, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a> quality of what's going out, the <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> of it, and keep being touched by that and our selves nourished by that. That gives the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, in that moment and in our lives, in the being, a kind of strength and sustainability. That's very much part of what <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> means - strength, sustainability. It also gives a <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a>, gives a balance, and this unshakeability, which is all part of what <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> means. And gives the heart a kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">buoyancy</a> so that we don't feel, as I said, burdened, overwhelmed, sinking underneath the weight of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> of the world. This is hugely important. So there's that balance.</span>

##### Don't underestimate the power of samadhi in the deepening of equanimity

<span class="paragraph">The other, or one other, piece that's really important with <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, going back to near the beginning of the <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a> in one sense is a kind of non-distractedness, you could say. When the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is distracted, what's really happening is it's toppling over, pulled out to reach things. It's pulled out towards this, or pulled out towards that, and that very distractedness is a non-balance, a non-<a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>. So really not to underestimate the benefits and the power of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> in the deepening of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> - <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a> in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> and the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practice, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> generally.</span>

##### Story: last year's retreatant who didn't want to do samadhi, pointing to the busyness of life

<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12289/20070208-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity_in_compassion-12289.mp3#t=12:40" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">I remember last year, after, I think it was after about two weeks, and there was one retreatant who, very thoughtfully, I thought, he said to me in an interview, "I think I don't want so much <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>. I feel like when I go out into the world and deal with <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> in the world, the fact is, I'm moving in life. I'm moving. There's busyness, there's distraction, there's all of that. There's basically not a lot of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> compared to …" He was getting in relatively deep states here. "It would be more relevant," he said, "to practise here the rest of the time in states of non-<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, you know, actually when I'm quite distracted." I didn't ask him how he was planning to distract himself, but … [laughter] Anyway.</span>

##### Samadhi allows any quality to sink into the cells
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^3-4" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^3-4" class="internal-link">3-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (2) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12289/20070208-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity_in_compassion-12289.mp3#t=13:31" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And so this was quite thoughtful, but as I say, not to underestimate. There's something that happens with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>. It sort of allows any quality, whether it's <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>, whether it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, whether it's <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, whatever it is, to kind of ==sink into the cells, and to be there, woven in almost to the fabric of our being==. So what's more common is to _not_ have so much <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, think we've understood something, think we've developed a lot of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, and find that when we go out it's a bit shaky.</span>

##### But it's also important to practice when the mind isn't that settled
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^3-5" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^3-5" class="internal-link">3-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So again, not to say there's a cut-off point, but just generally that we want to be not underestimating the power of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>. Having said that, what he said was also important, because sometimes we _are_ very busy, very distracted, and it's important to practise, too, when we're busy and when the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> isn't that settled. So both are important.</span>

##### The natural progression of samadhi leads to equanimity, which eventually becomes also accessible outside samadhi

<span class="paragraph">Generally, as samādhi deepens, as a general quality in the being, it actually leads to equanimity. It's part of the natural progression of samādhi - through physical pīti, what I talked about; through happiness; through peacefulness; to actually descend to depths of equanimity. And then, in the course of that - and this is usually a progression that takes months and months, but in the progression of that, the equanimity, too, gets kind of sewn into the being, and it's really something that's accessible in life, not just in the samādhi.</span>

##### How much is the self _doing_ the compassion practice
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^4-1" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^4-1" class="internal-link">4-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> (3) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (4) · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Okay, so there's this balance in the practice that I was talking about. There's the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>. There's also this factor about how much <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> is _doing_ the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practice. So sometimes, especially from the beginning weeks, really, if you're <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a>, it can very much feel like I'm sort of pumping away at the phrases, and then sometimes there's a feeling of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, and then sometimes not. But it feels like <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> is doing it, and <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> is sort of trying to get this <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> to happen, and then feeling the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> if it's there.</span>

##### As the self-sense gets quite, equanimity becomes the natural state
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^4-2" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^4-2" class="internal-link">4-2</a>**: _<a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> (7) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> (4)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12289/20070208-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity_in_compassion-12289.mp3#t=16:01" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">But some of you, I think, have noticed this - and again, not to make any kind of measurement out of this - but sometimes, as the sense of deepening happens in the practice, it can actually feel like it's not <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> doing it. It's not _me_ making <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. It's not me kind of pumping everything up with the phrases, and sort of making sure it's okay. It's more like <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is just something there that we can tune into, and <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> a little bit gets out of the way. It's not <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> doing it. This is quite an important area, or shift, that can happen in practice, if it happens. Self and <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> have a very, in a way, clear and interesting relationship. Basically, the more <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>-sense, the bigger <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>-sense, the stronger <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>-sense, the less the <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. It's actually that simple. It's either one or the other. As <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>-sense gets quiet, as the ego gets quiet, <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> is the natural state. There's less self in there, invested and worrying about, "Will this work out? Will it not work out? How's it all going?", and <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> is a natural settling, of when there's less self being built up.</span>

##### With spaciousness, any suffering can be held effortlessly in that space

<span class="paragraph">Sometimes, too, and some of you have reported this, as well: when there's less self doing it, there can sometimes feel like a <a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a> comes into the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practice. And again, it's not <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> doing it, but it's almost like there is a space, like there is space in the universe, and that space is imbued, is kind of shot through with <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. And that space, that space of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, holds any <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> that comes up in ourselves, in others, in an effortless way, through all time. So any <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> that was, any <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> that is now, any <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> that will be is just held, effortlessly, naturally, organically in that space.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And this is a sense that can open up. It's not me, little old me, holding someone else's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>.

So we could talk about <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> as being <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> and balance, but it's also a kind of <a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a>.

<span class="paragraph">Now, both of these - whether it's <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> doing it, and it just feels like this being over here giving <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> to that being over there, or it feels like there's not really much self doing it; it's just <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, it's just <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> being held in the space, just being held by a space of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> - both are important and both are necessary.

And also something a little bit more complicated, or potentially more messy, which is: sometimes when we are involved in a relationship, any kind of relationship with someone, or involved in helping or <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, something gets out of balance, and what's really happening is I am wanting or needing something from that person or from the situation. Sometimes it's clear, and sometimes it's a little more under the surface. So sometimes to ask oneself, "What do I want or need for myself here?" This can be quite complicated and messy and not clear, and it's not to say that we shouldn't have wants or needs either.</span>

##### It's challenging to care for someone who is clearly causing suffering for themselves
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^5-1" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^5-1" class="internal-link">5-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (3)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12289/20070208-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity_in_compassion-12289.mp3#t=21:04" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">If we're talking about <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> to a friend or a relationship, sometimes we feel when the other is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, when there is a lot of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the other, we feel, and especially if it goes on for a long period of time, we feel that "My needs in the relationship are not being met. My needs in this relationship are not being met." Or we are involved in a relationship or a situation of care for someone who is clearly causing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> for themselves in an ongoing way. They're maybe in some addiction or some destructive behaviour or whatever it is, and again, it can feel like, "My needs in this relationship are not being met." So this is quite a common scenario, and I know, in my past, I've certainly been involved in these kind of situations. Someone once said to me - I mean, it's strange language they used - but it's a very high level of care, to be in that situation in a healthy way, and caring for someone who's doing that, without having it be unhealthy - on both sides.</span>

##### Am I finding a way to care of my needs?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^5-2" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^5-2" class="internal-link">5-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Relationships" class="internal-link">Relationships</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Am I taking care of my needs, if that is the situation? So maybe I _do_ have genuine needs. And again, this goes back to a talk a while ago: we can talk about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, and it can sound all very abstract and completely clean and pure, but the reality of our life is that we are involved in <a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a>, and we all have needs and wants within that. So am I taking care of my needs? Am I finding a way to do that?</span>

##### Co-dependence can happen
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^5-3" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^5-3" class="internal-link">5-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So it may be that we're in a situation where we actually end up feeling quite lonely. Or we feel like we need a friend. Or that, as I said, we're not being met, or we're not feeling loved. This is quite common. Sometimes it's a little bit even more complicated; we may be involved in a situation where we are actually invested somehow in being needed. So we're interested in <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, but another sort of stratum in there is that a part of us actually wants to keep the person somewhat down so that we are needed. And again, this can come in in very insidious ways. Not, again, not to be scared of all this, because this is part of humanity, and it's part of being human. I think some psychotherapies call that co-dependence, that kind of - it's a whole system in place of, "You be messed up so that I can feel needed," and it's just something that human beings do sometimes.</span>

##### We might want some recognition for our efforts
<span class="counts"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^5-4" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^5-4" class="internal-link">5-4</a></span>

<span class="paragraph">Or we may be involved in service, in helping people or trying to help people, and we're actually wanting a sense of achievement. We want this person to get better so we can feel like, "Yeah, right, something happened, you know. I did something. I was helpful." And this is completely understandable and completely normal. Or we may be involved in - and again, totally normal, totally human - we want some recognition for our efforts. You know, we work really hard to help, in whatever field it is, and then just feel like, "Well, it's not really being seen," or being seen in the way that we want it to be seen.</span>

##### So we need to ask ourselves in those situations how we can get at least some of what we need in a healthy way
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^5-5" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^5-5" class="internal-link">5-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (5) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12289/20070208-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity_in_compassion-12289.mp3#t=24:42" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So all of that. And it's quite, you know, complex and messy, and very human. Can I take care of myself in a healthy way? Can I get at least _some_ of what I need in a healthy way? So some of this is not easy, but to begin asking that question in the situations. When we're involved in <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> and <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, in a situation where it's difficult, where it feels like the person is difficult or there's <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>, there's judgement, there's irritability with them, or we're just frustrated, we're frustrated with the situation, with the stuckness of the situation, we're frustrated with this person, whatever - really, really skilful to turn the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> on oneself. So again, we tend to assume, to go straight into, "Oh, I just need to inject more <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> towards them and clean it up that way." _We're_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> there, and to really notice that and touch that with <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. And then sometimes our relationship to the situation, the person, and the flow of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> in that situation begins to soften, the <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a> begins to soften, and we're able to work more easily.</span>

##### Politics show that there are limits in how much we can help
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^6-1" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^6-1" class="internal-link">6-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">Brahmaviharas</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12289/20070208-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity_in_compassion-12289.mp3#t=26:11" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">You know, it's an immense task, I think, to take these <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a> on in our life. And it's really a lifelong thing, to say "I'm really deeply interested, deeply committed to living a life, living in the world with <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>," and somehow be steady through all of it. That's immense. And we do see that part of where the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> comes in is just realizing (and a lot of it is very clear) that there are limits to how much we can help, there are limits to our influence. So certainly we see this politically. In all political situations, all political structures, systems that I can think of, there's a real limit to the individual's, one individual's capacity to change. So we could see something like - well, all kinds of things that are going on now; just the limits of our influence politically.</span>

##### Bringing equanimity in seeing the web of conditions which makes any situation what it is
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^6-2" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^6-2" class="internal-link">6-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> · <a data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">Dependent Origination</a> (2) · <a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">A big part of bringing <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> in is actually seeing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">web of conditions</a>, seeing that someone's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">freedom from suffering</a> doesn't just depend on me. I can be doing all I can to help them, I may be the closest person to them, but it doesn't just depend on me. And so to begin to shift the seeing - this takes quite some time - to begin to see all the factors, all the conditions, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">web of conditions</a> that comes in to make any situation what it is.</span>

##### Example: Dharma talk
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^6-3" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^6-3" class="internal-link">6-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> (4) · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">Dependent Origination</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12289/20070208-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity_in_compassion-12289.mp3#t=28:01" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So, for instance, a <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> talk is quite an interesting example. It can seem as if I'm sitting here giving a <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> talk, and you're listening. My <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> is that's, you know, on one level, of course, that's what's happening. On another level, we're all giving this <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> talk. It's a complete co-<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a>. What's coming out of my mouth, the feeling in the room, the words I choose, the tone of voice, all of it is as much dependent on you and how you're feeling and what you're mirroring back to me, and this kind of interplay that's inextricable, as it is to what we all had for lunch in the day, and how tired I am, and everything is coming together. And I am quite tired! [laughter] Everything's coming together to make a <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> talk. We tend to see it in terms of selves, and selves being responsible for things. It's a complete coming together.</span>

##### Maybe it's just a seed
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^6-4" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^6-4" class="internal-link">6-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a> · <a data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">Dependent Origination</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Then, I'll say, as a teacher, you know, you want to put something out there, and you want to say, "Well, I hope this changes people. I hope there's some transformation. I hope it makes a difference in people's lives." And that's a very earnest aspiration, <a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a>. But as a teacher, I have to remind myself this is probably just one little drop, or one little seed, which will meet a whole web of other conditions later on. So it may be something happens. Maybe, you know, as I'm talking, someone says, "I've got it! That's it! Actually, I don't need to stay for the rest, Rob. I'll be having tea if you want me." [laughter] Maybe. That would be great. ==But mostly it's actually just a little drop, and then one goes out into that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">infinite web of conditions</a> in the life. Maybe it's just a seed. It meets another condition, then it begins to sprout. Maybe it sprouts a little here, and then it gets watered. Maybe it meets the wrong conditions and it just gets covered over, you know?==</span>

##### Somthing you've done or said, it might just be enough that it can blossom later for that person
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^6-5" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^6-5" class="internal-link">6-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">Dependent Origination</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So we have to see that what we put into a situation in terms of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> and care is only one little ingredient in a vast <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">web of conditions</a>. So even, it seems that we're doing all we can to help someone, just to realize that - certainly if they're going to live longer - they will meet other conditions, and maybe something you've done or said, it will just be enough that it can blossom later for that person.</span>

##### Equanimity is not indifference
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^6-6" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^6-6" class="internal-link">6-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">Brahmaviharas</a> · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> (5) · <a data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">Near enemy</a> · <a data-href="Spiritual circles" class="internal-link">Spiritual circles</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">But it's tricky, I mean, it's really tricky. This is a hard one. All these <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a> are difficult, but certainly <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> is difficult. And <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, just to be really clear, is not a kind of detachment, coldness, greyness, disconnection. It's not indifference. Indifference is actually the <a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a> of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. So it can look like <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, look like, "Yeah, I'm fine. If you get healed, fine. If you suffer, that's fine," but actually, there's no real care there. So indifference is what _can_ look like <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, but it's not. And this is quite interesting, especially in <a data-href="spiritual circles" class="internal-link">spiritual circles</a>, when a lot of stock gets put into non-attachment and peace and kind of, you know, being 'beyond' things, etc.</span>

##### The barometer for any view (like karma, or God's will) is: what's it doing to the heart?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^7-1" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^7-1" class="internal-link">7-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Karma" class="internal-link">Karma</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">In the Eastern religions, there's this doctrine of <a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a> and past lives and everything, and sometimes people say, "Well, they're like that because of their previous <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, and in a way, it's their fault, you know." Or in the West it's, "Oh, it's just God's will." I just can't really relate to that at all; to me, it's really not a useful way of thinking. Or rather, one has to _check_ if it's useful, in the sense that, is an attitude like that bringing indifference? So once I was meeting with someone who was not <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a>, and she was talking about reincarnation and past lives, and she said, "Is it right? Is it wrong?", and I said, you know, "I don't know." I asked her, "Is it actually opening your heart or not? Are you feeling more care coming from it? Are you feeling more commitment to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>, to <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>?" And she said "Yes," so I said, "Great. If that's what's helping, then go for it." And the view might change later on, but the barometer is really: what's it doing to the heart? So what is my responsibility? Response-ability - my ability to respond. It's not <a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a> or God's will as a sort of, you know, leading to indifference, and this is really important.</span>

##### Can the compassion stay steady and strong, but also that the tenderness of the heart remains?

<span class="paragraph">So sometimes all those pieces of self-interest that I was talking about, and the way that self can kind of get entangled in a whole situation of care, sometimes that's relatively _not_ there. <a data-href="The self" class="internal-link">The self</a> is not so invested in an unhealthy way or in any way like that. And still, we vibrate, we resonate with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. And the question for <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> is: can the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> stay steady and stay strong, but stay tender, that that tenderness of the heart remains? And sometimes it's very clear that we're seeing someone cause and perpetuate <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> for themselves through <a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a>. They're caught in some pattern that they're not <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> - some addiction, some behaviour or whatever it is - and they're just perpetuating the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, causing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> and keeping it going through <a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a>. And that's hard to see. It's hard to be with. Especially when the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is there, it's hard to see. When there's <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> there, it's hard to see.</span>

And it's trying to make clearer to the heart that is already open, already soft and tender with <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, it's trying to make it clearer, the limits of our responsibility and the responsibility of an other, and how <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> actually arises because of conditions, and often a person's actions.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Just to say, of course there's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the world that comes - it's nothing to do with the person; it's just descended on them from the environment or political situation or whatever. And then there are other levels of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, other kinds of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, that are really what humans bring on themselves through <a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a>. And this is what the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s really interested in as well. So these phrases - I'll actually just read them:</span>

##### This formal equanimity practice brings in the recollection to balance the compassion

<span class="paragraph">So to me, even just reading it, it's quite sobering, you know, to a heart - when there's <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, it's quite sobering actually realizing the limits. And so the <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> practice in this very formal way is just bringing that recollection to <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, bringing that recollection to <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> to balance the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, if it's not already balanced.</span>

##### Still, loving-kindness and compassion is the best way to live, even if actions or results seem to fall short

<span class="paragraph">And so, we _do_ live in a world where, as I said, there are limits to our care. There are limits to the effects of our actions that we can see, certainly, and limits to what we can do. And so we see, and if you're involved in service, you are involved in situations where one's trying everything one can, one puts everything that one can in, and there's still <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, there's still the situation. But, and I think John said this in the opening talk, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, best way to live. The best way to live. So even if the action, even if the results, are not what we want them to do, the heart of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is the best way to be in the world. And that heart balanced with a sense of <a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a>, balanced with a sense of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. So this balance is not a tightrope. It's not a kind of razor's edge that we're walking. That's quite important. To me, it's more a sense of a softening, a <a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a>. So it's not something very tense, to keep on this balance of <a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. There's a kind of softening that can happen as the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> deepens, as the <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> deepens, also as the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> deepens. And a <a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a> that comes with that.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So the more we see into the <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> of self and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of all things</a>, the more that kind of <a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a> and that kind of softness can come in, and we're able to walk this tightrope (which really isn't a tightrope), we're able to walk that in a much more relaxed and effortless way. I would still say that's very difficult, but the movement is towards a kind of softening.</span>

##### Paradoxically, we become even more devoted with seeing the emptiness of everything

<span class="paragraph">To me, as we go deeper into really <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> what <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> is and having that touch the heart - I think I said this the other day - what comes out of that is a sense of <a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a>, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, and peace, and <a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a>. Another sense that comes out is some kind of sense of <a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a>, I would call it. I don't really know another word for it - <a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a>. And that can take all kinds of forms. A heart that has opened, or is opening to <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>, there's a kind of <a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a> to the world, at one level, that just comes in. So paradoxically, we see the <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> of self, the <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> of beings, the <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> of the world, and we're even more devoted to it somehow, even more devoted. And that <a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a> has a quality of not being so attached to the result. There's a real softness in it. There's a softening in it. So seeing into <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> is not a kind of <a data-href="nihilism" class="internal-link">nihilism</a>. I think I said this the other day as well. It's a strange translation, but '<a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>,' it can kind of make you feel like, "Well, there's nothing. There are no people. There's nothing. Nothing matters." But to go into what's called the extreme view of <a data-href="nihilism" class="internal-link">nihilism</a> would give rise to indifference, which would be the <a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a> of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. It's a kind of disconnection - disconnect, not caring, disinterested, aloof.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So as we talked about in the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice, the more we actually contemplate this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a> in the different ways, the more we actually find it's opening up <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, it's opening up a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love" data-href="Love" class="internal-link">sense of connection</a>. It should be, if we're sort of on the right track with it. And we talked about doing that with contemplating just <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> moments, ownerless <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> moments, not really anyone owning these <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> moments of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. And the different ways, and we talked about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>, and also talked about this sense of <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> being fullness, being <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">non-separation</a>, so that I cannot actually find a separate being. It seems the most obvious thing in the world: here we are, a room full of whatever it is, numbers of beings, but as I look deeper and I go into it, I cannot actually find separate beings. Cannot find myself separate, cannot find others separate. And in that, the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> is there. So there's that <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> of selves - my self and other selves - and that brings the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, it brings the <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. And at a whole other level, there's even the <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. You can say, "Okay, well there are no beings, _really_," but even <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, too, as you go really deep into it, that's also empty. And yet, paradoxically, seeing that brings <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> in a way that there's <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> for it.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So often when <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>'s talked about, and the question is, "Well, _how_ can I develop <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>?", the contemplation of <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a> is usually given as the sort of - _that's_ where it's at.

<span class="paragraph">I would say, it is curious. <a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a> is extremely obvious.

It's very clear to us. The question from the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> perspective is: are we seeing, are we contemplating <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a> in a way that's actually bringing a sense of <a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a>, bringing a sense of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>?

So to find ways, and to talk with teachers and friends and whatever, and to find ways of working with <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a>, actually bringing, in the moment, a sense of <a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a>. In the moment, one feels as one's contemplating it, "Ah, oh, yeah, release, release." I think I touched on <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a> in one of the other talks, and I'm actually not going to go into that right now.</span>

##### (2) Equanimity deepens by letting go of grasping and craving

<span class="paragraph">I touched earlier in this talk on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> and the progress of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>. The natural progress of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, as it gets deeper and deeper - and I'm talking about really quite deep states of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> now - naturally move into <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. Naturally and organically, <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> is a state of deep <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>. How does it deepen? How does <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> deepen? It actually deepens by <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a> of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a> and <a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a>. So the more, in the moment, we let go of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a> - of <a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a> after something or trying to get rid of something - the more the being moves into <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>.

<span class="paragraph">And we can do this at subtler and subtler levels, and the <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> just gets deeper and deeper.

<span class="paragraph">We're almost near the end of the <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> now, but as a state, when there's a sense of the <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> deepening, the other factor that helps it deepen is actually the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> tuning into how it feels. ==So it has a certain feeling-tone, <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, to it, a certain peacefulness, a certain stillness, and it's the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> kind of tuning into that wavelength, that resonance, and just being there with it, noticing it, feeling it, opening to it, and enjoying it, enjoying it, that allows it to deepen, to settle in the being.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">It's interesting. For a lot of people, it's really an acquired taste - deep <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a>, deep stillness, deep <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. It's really an acquired taste, because generally our sense of _oomph_ in life, and _va-va-voom,_ and you know, things we get excited about, are generally _not_ in places of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. They're in places of <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> getting really excited about something, either something that we take as good or something that we take as dreadful, so some big drama we're caught in. And to steady and let <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> kind of get quiet, and just stillness, and just stillness, and just <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> - that can be, for many, many people, as I say, it's an acquired taste.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And just to mention briefly, also, the place of muditā, of joy, in the deepening of equanimity. I don't have time to go into this today, but joy, you know, whatever word you want - well-being, joy, deep nourishment, happiness, whatever word - that forms a basis for the being being able to really open to equanimity. Certainly in the samādhi it's also a basis, but in one's life, when there is more a sense of joy in one's life, we are less dependent on the external circumstances being this way or that way. It makes less of an impact, because we feel like we have enough. And this is a very gradual journey for most people, and a very non-linear journey. But looking into: how is it that my well of joy, my reservoir of inner happiness, can be deepened in life? And so looking into: how does the being open to wonder? How does it open to the mystery of life, to the awe of things? What's the place of art and music in that? What's the place of our relationship with nature? All of that. Certainly the mettā and the compassion practice build those reservoirs over time, build the inner reservoirs of happiness.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Sometimes we lose our balance, we lose our <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> in relationship to a situation either inner or outer, because we are caught up in <a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a>, and "What will the future be?

We're caught up in <a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a>. And so, for instance, something like climate change, how much of what's going on with that and the way that we as a species are (_if_ we are) addressing it, how much of that is actually caught up in the <a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a>. The scenarios on the front page of the newspaper: what will it be like in 2056? It's a lot of <a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a>, which is fine. There's a real skill in <a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a>. ==So again, in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma practice</a> as well, what will my life be like if I don't take care of the kind of intentions I have in life, of the kind of actions, of the kind of speech, of cultivating what is beautiful? How will I be in twenty, thirty years if I'm still alive? What will have happened to the heart?== And you can see this in other people, over decades. I shouldn't say this, but one just sees in other people - they've been cultivating or not certain qualities, and as they get older, one sees the being.</span>

##### When future thinking is skilful and when it's not

<span class="paragraph">And so sometimes <a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a> is actually really skilful, to see: where does this lead? Where is how I'm living, what I'm choosing, where is it leading me in my heart? But sometimes <a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a> is actually not that skilful, and it can be quite skilful to drop it, to just drop <a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a>. Not compound a situation, build up a sense of problem, by kind of tacking on the future to it. So here's this difficult situation internally or externally, and I'm just kind of imagining it going on forever, or "When will it end?" Do you see what I mean? You're building a solidity to it by time concept. And this goes on without us even realizing it.</span>

##### Practice: snip off the past and the future, just seeing this moment
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0208 Equanimity in Compassion > ^11-2" data-href="0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^11-2" class="internal-link">11-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So sometimes it can be really skilful to practise shifting into another mode where one's just kind of snipping off the past and the future, and just seeing, "There's just this moment. There's just this moment." Experientially, existentially, that's all there can be. There's just this moment. And in this moment, all there can be is an impression in <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, experientially. So I'm not saying anything about "there is a world or there isn't a world," but from a sort of meditator's contemplative perspective, all there is now is this impression in <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, whatever sense it comes through.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So I can get caught up in the idea of losing things, or "my house" or "my this" or "my that." All my house can ever be is an impression in <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> in the moment. All my anything can be is an impression in <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> in the moment. We get so caught up in a sense of solidifying things in a way that experientially they're actually _not_. Now, of course that view has its limits, but as a skilful means in <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>, it's actually very skilful. Really practising that, the whole sense of life can shift, over time - this whole sense of life being not as substantial as we tend to take it. This is another kind of approach to <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>. It's quite a popular approach, actually: just seeing things as impressions in <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> in the moment.</span>

<span class="paragraph">A slightly more sophisticated approach is seeing things as just <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a>. They're <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a> that are built, that are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a>. ==So this practice that we've been doing this week, with directing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a> towards things, and sometimes the things <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a> - one actually sees that, through the lack of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a> or the lack of <a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a>, a <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a> is actually getting built, it's getting <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a> or compounded, to use the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s words, constructed in the moment. Without the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> doing something, that <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a> cannot be there. So something, whatever's going on, is just a <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a>. It's just <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a>. It's empty, in other words. It's empty.==</span>

##### Less push and pull means more equanimity and a fading of experience

<span class="paragraph">So through our practice and through our life, when we begin to stop elevating certain things and putting down other things - whatever they are, inner experiences, or outer things, or other people, or situations or whatever - when that movement gets less, when there is less <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a> of what we don't like and trying to keep or pull towards us what we do like, when that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">push and pull</a> gets quieter (and it goes through a whole range of getting quieter, very, very subtle), this is the movement into <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. And similar to the practice that we're doing now, there can be, as <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">the push and the pull</a> gets quieter, there can be a kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a> of <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>.

<span class="paragraph">Sometimes they can dissolve completely. There's virtually nothing left. Sometimes there's just a little dissolving. Sometimes it's almost like the world has become a very soft, gentle flickering of sensation in a very quiet and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a> and relaxed way, and that's all that remains of the world.

<span class="paragraph">And then, at that level, we may think, "Well, hasn't it completely turned round?" So used to think, used to define <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> as being a <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> in relation to what's difficult or what's great, or what's exciting or whatever, and the heart just stays steady. As the <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> really deepens, not much really arises anyway. There's nothing really happening. So I can't really be equanimous in relation to what's difficult, because there's nothing there to be equanimous in relation _to_. It's gone. It's taken a whole different level of meaning.</span>

<span class="paragraph">There's a very important thing here. Sometimes, you know, describing kinds of experiences or states - it's not to snatch at the experience. What's much more important is the understanding. So sometimes there's an experience, sometimes there isn't; the more important thing is the understanding. And the understanding there is that, again, similar to the practice that we've been doing this week, how a thing appears depends on my relationship to it. Whether it appears at all depends on my relationship to it. How a thing is, then, depends on the push and the pull, and is inherently immeasurable. There is no _real_ way it is. It's immeasurable.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So this is more important than a certain kind of <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>. We're actually beginning to see into, in a very deep level, the <a data-href="immeasurability" class="internal-link">immeasurability</a> of all things.

Because we see the universality of it all. ==That principle is something that applies to all <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Consciousness" data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousnesses</a> - not even just human beings; all <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Consciousness" data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousnesses</a>.

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Yeah, that's an important question, yeah. <a data-href="Samatha" class="internal-link">Samatha</a> in the sense of taking one object, like the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> or the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> or the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> or whatever it is, and just going deep in that, yeah, eventually that will lead to a deepening, through different stages, and there will be <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. So that's one way. The other way is more a kind of <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> way, and that would be what I touched on here - being conscious of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a>, of pushing, pulling, <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>, holding on, <a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a>, etc., in the moment, and just relaxing that, finding a way to let go of the <a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a>, the <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> in the moment. And then what happens is, <a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a> and <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> is actually an agitation of the being, and so there is a relative degree of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a>. Then, potentially, I mean, you could call _that_ a deepening of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, but in that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a>, because of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a> allows a more subtle seeing, a deeper seeing, so one actually can sometimes pick up on more subtle levels of <a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a>, <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>, <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a>, and feel that, and let go of that. And so one way that the whole thing can deepen is just by getting more and more subtle with that. And at a certain point, it gets very subtle, and will include things like just taking some <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> to be me or mine or whatever, and we'll go through a whole range of subtlety with that. So that would be going at it via an <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> way.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Exactly, yes. And so in the open, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a> technique, there's a degree of resting, but there's also some degree of _doing,_ but the _doing_ is a kind of <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a> - one just keeps <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a>, and then feeling the loveliness, the release of the <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a>, and then feeling, "Ah, there's a bit more," and <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a>. So it's not a great sort of [huffing and puffing]; it's quite <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a>. And there's just enough doing, in the <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a>, to keep the space alive and soft and deepening in <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, all of those things. And some of the <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a> gets extremely subtle, _extremely_ subtle as you go deep into it. If you get really skilful at all of that, what you can do, especially if you have a background in <a data-href="samatha" class="internal-link">samatha</a> practice, is once that open space is there, it's almost like you can filter out the <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> and choose to focus in on that, and then have a much more contained <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> which is more like a deep state of absorption. That takes quite some practice, but it's possible, so one can actually move between these two - between a more open kind of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: If it's relatively gross, in the sense of I'm trying to concentrate on this thing and the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> keeps getting distracted by this and then that and then this and then that, and one feels like one can't keep the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice, that sort of level, I would just keep doing the steadying of the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> with one object. If there's already a sense of <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a>, then that's enough <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> to pick up on the sense of just how it feels to grasp after something or to push something away, and you can kind of feel it. If there's a bit more <a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a>, you feel it in the subtle, physical, in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">subtle body sense</a>.

If there's a bit more <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> of the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, that's a really good way too. They're both valid, and in a way, the answer is really to experiment. So sometimes even in the course of trying to stay with one object, and there's a lot of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a> or something, sometimes the best way is just to be more open - feel the pull of that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a>, so that you actually feel it as a "Ungh," and you just relax it.</span>

There's a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a> of it through <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>, and there's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> there. And actually noticing, feeling the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. Sometimes it's very subtle <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> that we're talking about. Sometimes it's less subtle. ==But sometimes it can be just the sense of <a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a> is a sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. And one notices that when there's pushing or pulling or <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>, there's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> there. As I relax that, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> goes. And being actually sensitive to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> and the release of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> is really key in the deepening of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. So there's a real sensitivity to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> and its release, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> and its release, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> and its release, as the process deepens==. So it's actually good to be sensitive in that way.</span>

##### It's good to stick for the session with one practice and use the other(s) as a backup

<span class="paragraph">In the moment, which will be the right approach, it's hard to say. And it's more a question of which practice you're kind of doing at the time. It can be quite important to have, "This is the practice that I'm doing. This is what I'm doing 90 per cent of the time, and this is my sort of emergency backup practice that I'm taking out in emergencies." [laughter] And then, you know, when I'm trying to stay with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> or whatever, and it's really not happening today or this sitting, and I've been plugging away for forty minutes, half an hour, whatever it is, okay, now I plug in the other practice. Other times, the more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a> practice is the main one, it's really not happening, and I need to settle the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> with one object. But it's good to have like one thing: "This is what I'm doing. The other one's a backup." That will help, I think.</span>
