##### What is going on in this retreat, here: how insights can lead to love
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^1-1" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^1-1" class="internal-link">1-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> (2) · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> (3) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (4) · <a data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Awakening</a> (2) · <a data-href="Healing" class="internal-link">Healing</a> · <a data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">Beauty</a> · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (5) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (5) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So through this practice, in this [[retreat]], a number of things are going on, hopefully. And one is the [[cultivation]] of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>. We could say the [[awakening]] of the heart, the [[awakening]] of a different way of being in the world. One could say that. And the development of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, the deepening of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> as a gift, as a [[healing]] for ourselves and for the world. And all the benefits that that brings, and all the [[beauty]] that that brings. And we've talked also about the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, and the development of that and the benefits of that. And in this [[retreat]] in particular, how [[love]] develops [[insight]]. How [[love]] itself and the development of [[love]] leads to [[insight]]. We'll be talking more about that. But in _this_ talk, what I want to go into a little bit is how <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a> can lead to [[love]], how the process of [[insight]] can feed and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourish</a> the process of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> and [[compassion]]. So <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a> [[love]] through [[insight]].</span>

##### Metta is fabricated, but it's also the natural state
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^1-2" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (6) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (4) · <a data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">Fabrication</a> (3) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> · <a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> (2) · <a data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">Ignorance</a> (2) · <a data-href="Nature" class="internal-link">Nature</a> (3) · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">It can seem at first that what we're doing in this practice is we're putting in lots of huff and puff, and building up some <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, creating some <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, creating [[love]]. And in a sense, that's true. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Mettā</a> is a [[fabrication]], it's true. All things are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrications</a>, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> is a [[fabrication]]. But what can also seem to be the case - and it can move towards this becoming clearer - is that perhaps [[love]], <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, [[compassion]], is the natural state, the natural expression when the [[mind]], the [[consciousness]] is not clouded by [[clinging]] and [[ignorance]]. When the [[clinging]] is relaxed, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> is there, the [[compassion]] is there and the [[love]] is there. And as [[ignorance]], as this misunderstanding of the [[nature]] of [[the self]], the [[nature]] of the world, the [[nature]] of things, as that begins to dissolve a little bit, in the moments when that's not there so strong, then the [[love]] is there as a natural state and a natural expression.</span>

##### Insight is that which releases clinging
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^1-3" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (6) · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> (6) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (2) · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a> (4) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">When we talk about [[insight]], oftentimes we use this word, and we say '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a>,' and sometimes it's sort of, "I wonder what's actually meant there?" <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a>, to me, is that which releases [[clinging]]. Okay? So there's [[clinging]], there's constricting ourselves around something inner or outer, pushing it away, pulling it towards us, holding on to it, struggling with it. And [[clinging]] brings with it <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> is that which, either through intellectual <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>, through reflection, just an intuitive sense, some very organic sense, at any level at all (fairly easy or superficial, right down to the depths of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>), releases that [[clinging]] and therefore releases <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. So that's what [[insight]] is. The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s enormously interested in this, and he's interested in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a> ourselves, our lives, the moment, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a> and relating, that bring this release. And with the release, with the release from [[clinging]], comes [[love]]. So [[ways of looking]] that bring a release of [[clinging]] and bring with that [[love]].</span>

##### Constrictions block our capacity to love
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^1-4" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> (2) · <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (6) · <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (6) · <a data-href="Constriction" class="internal-link">Constriction</a> · <a data-href="Anger" class="internal-link">Anger</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">And so what I want to go into a little bit is perhaps a possibility of incorporating some of that into the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice and the practice of [[compassion]]. So we can see in our lives (and hopefully this should get more and more clear as our <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> deepens): when there is [[clinging]] or [[aversion]], there's less [[love]]. So a very obvious one is [[fear]]. <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> is a kind of [[clinging]], it's a kind of [[aversion]], a kind of [[constriction]]. When that's around, it kind of blocks [[love]]. It blocks our capacity to [[love]], our capacity of openness of heart, of connection. And we can actually see that [[love]] and [[fear]] have a kind of inversely proportional relationship, as the mathematicians say: more [[fear]], kind of the less accessibility to [[love]]. And [[love]] has a way of actually dissolving [[fear]], can do. Conversely, we can see in ourselves, certainly, and in the world and in others, how much when there's a lot of [[fear]], oftentimes there's a lot of [[anger]] right there, a lot of violence right there, and we just have to open a newspaper to see a lot of that.</span>

##### Baba Amte
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^2-1" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Baba Amte" class="internal-link">Baba Amte</a> · <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">A little over a couple of years ago, I had the good fortune to meet someone in India. Not a spiritual person at all. He didn't regard himself that way, very sort of humanist person. I and some friends, about ten or twelve of us, had gone out to work at a leprosy community in Maharashtra in India, and spent about a month there. And met the guy who started this community. His name is <a data-href="Baba Amte" class="internal-link">Baba Amte</a>. His story is quite remarkable, and it kind of illustrates this relationship between [[fear]] and [[love]].</span>

##### "If you want to understand someone, you have to step into their shoes for a while"
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^2-2" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Mahatma Gandhi" class="internal-link">Mahatma Gandhi</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">He'd grown up very rich, one of these very wealthy Indian, almost aristocratic [families], and got a job as a lawyer at some point, and then met <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahatma Gandhi" data-href="Mahatma Gandhi" class="internal-link">Gandhi</a> when he was a young man. And somehow moved towards representing the disenfranchised in India. So he was, I think, living in Calcutta and representing the people, the workers who clean out the sewers in Calcutta. So you can kind of imagine what conditions they were living in, and was trying to represent them legally. And <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahatma Gandhi" data-href="Mahatma Gandhi" class="internal-link">Gandhi</a> said to him at one point, "If you want to understand someone, you have to step into their shoes for a while."</span>

##### Finding a dying man in the sewers of Calcutta
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^2-3" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Mahatma Gandhi" class="internal-link">Mahatma Gandhi</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So he took that, he took <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahatma Gandhi" data-href="Mahatma Gandhi" class="internal-link">Gandhi</a> at his words, and he got a job down there cleaning the sewers in Calcutta. You can imagine. He decided to do that for a year. And one day, he was coming home at night in the dark from a day's working in the sewers, and he tripped over something in the road. He looked down, and he saw that it was a man lying in the road, abandoned and dying of leprosy in its final stages. He saw this man there and was so horrified that he ran home. Immediate kind of knee-jerk response, and he ran to his home. And when he arrived home, kind of out of breath, he got there and then he realized, "Oh, what have I done?" And he sort of gathered himself, went back, found the man, picked him up, took him home, and nursed him in the days until he died, and was with him in that period.</span>

##### Maharashtra
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^2-4" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^2-4" class="internal-link">2-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (6) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (5) · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">He had already seen this kind of relationship between [[fear]] and [[love]], and the closing that can come with [[fear]]. But he said that was really a turning point for him. So he gave up his job as a lawyer, and he somehow bent the ear of the Maharashtran government to give him a piece of desert scrubland. He and his wife and two baby boys, I think four lepers and a lame cow [laughter], this ragtaggle mob, went to this scrub piece of desert, basically, in Maharashtra. They started, mostly him, started to build this community. And that was, I think, in the early fifties. I went there a few years ago. And amazing what's been built there. Five thousand people or something live there. They're completely self-subsistent in many things. Beautiful place, a lot of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> there. And remarkable to meet this man. I mean, this is kind of extraordinary, you know - most of us, we can only appreciate that. And to meet this man who consistently in his life had chosen [[love]] over [[fear]], and that he was 92, and actually has not been able to walk or has not been able to stand up for, I don't know how many years, forty years or something. All he can do is walk a little and lie down. And just the presence that was there through a lifetime of keeping making the choice of [[love]] over [[fear]], [[love]] over [[fear]], [[love]] over [[fear]]. Really extraordinary.</span>

##### Don't push away fear, but incline the awareness a bit towards loveliness
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^2-5" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^2-5" class="internal-link">2-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (12) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (4) · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> · <a data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">Pleasantness</a> · <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So I want to just, in a way, actually, now that I mention it, take a little bit of a tangent. Because some people have been saying that [[fear]] has been coming up in the practice, and anyway there's this relationship between [[fear]] and [[love]]. So I just want to say a little bit about working with [[fear]]. As I mentioned, I think, in the talk on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, sometimes the [[mind]] feels like it's deepening and opening into kind of new states, new senses of openness, or depths. And sometimes, with that, a [[fear]] will come up. Some of the time, there are these two things kind of going on at once: there's a sense of the new space and the openness of that and maybe the loveliness of that, even, and the [[fear]]. And at the same time, they're there. If the [[fear]] isn't that strong - and sometimes there's no [[fear]], but if the [[fear]] isn't that strong, it's possible not to ignore the [[fear]], but also just to kind of tip the [[mind]] over a little bit, tip the [[awareness]] over a little bit to go into the loveliness. Just incline the [[mind]] to what's pleasant there, even if it's just very non-dramatically pleasant. Give the [[mind]] some sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a>, of something that it can trust there. Not <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a> the [[fear]] or ignoring it. It can be really skilful if that feels like it's going on in the practice. If it feels really strong, then it needs turning to and working with. And sometimes, of course, [[fear]] has nothing to do with the practice or whatever. So I just want to briefly go into working with [[fear]] a little bit.</span>

##### Fear involves unpleasant body sensations and a constriction of the mind
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^3-1" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^3-1" class="internal-link">3-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (5) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Constriction" class="internal-link">Constriction</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> (5) · <a data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">Spaciousness</a> · <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So, often we run away from [[fear]], we don't even stop to wait and investigate a little bit: what actually is this that I'm running away from? What actually is [[fear]]? If we go into it a little bit more clearly, can see: [[fear]] is, one way of breaking it down is, [[fear]] involves some unpleasant physical sensations - you know, the heart pounding, or the tummy butterflying or whatever - unpleasant physical sensations, and the reaction to them, their being unpleasant. Usually, not always, some thoughts, which are generally unpleasant, spinning around, and the reaction to them. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Body sensations</a>, unpleasant, and reaction; the thoughts, unpleasant, and the reaction. And then something a bit more subtle: a [[constriction]] of the [[mind]], a [[constriction]] of [[consciousness]]. It feels like [[consciousness]] kind of shrinks down with [[fear]] and becomes very small. And we don't generally like having a small [[consciousness]]; we enjoy more a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a> kind of [[consciousness]]. And so that constricting of the [[consciousness]] is also experienced as unpleasant, and there will be a reaction to that, generally a reaction of [[aversion]].</span>

##### Piecemeal approach to working with fear
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^3-2" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^3-2" class="internal-link">3-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (3)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Not to be anal, but that kind of constellation is what makes up [[fear]]. And just to mention that, just to go into that in order to have ways in to work with [[fear]], so that we can get hold of a piece and begin working with it, rather than just being overwhelmed by this mass of [[fear]], which is often the case.</span>

##### Practice: total acceptance of the physical sensations of fear
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^3-3" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^3-3" class="internal-link">3-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (15) · <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Acceptance" class="internal-link">Acceptance</a> · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">Spaciousness</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So what is [[fear]]? Beginning to get a handle on it. What is our relationship with [[fear]]? Generally, it's [[aversion]], it's unpleasant and we flee it. We have [[fear]] of [[fear]]. Now, this is very common. There's [[fear]] around, and we're actually afraid of [[fear]]. It's so unpleasant that we're running away from it. In practice, we can begin working with [[fear]] in different ways so that we gradually learn to accommodate [[fear]]. And gradually, slowly, over time, learn to have a confidence with [[fear]], with the presence of [[fear]]. This is one thing that's lacking. <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> comes up, and we're afraid of it, we don't feel confident with it. If it's possible to actually practise in a different way, even instead of trying to be so <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a> of the [[fear]], practising complete - if possible, as complete as possible - a total [[acceptance]] of the physical sensations of [[fear]]. So that [[consciousness]] or [[awareness]] feels like it's actually more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a> than the [[fear]]. The [[fear]] sensations can be there in a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a> [[awareness]], and they're just allowed, they're just allowed. They're welcomed, even. So this really is a practice.</span>

##### "I can accomodate this"
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^3-4" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^3-4" class="internal-link">3-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> · <a data-href="Constriction" class="internal-link">Constriction</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">And over time one of the things that can develop is we really begin to feel like, it's just some unpleasant sensations. <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a>, "I can accommodate this. I can accommodate this." And it's possible for the unpleasant sensations to be there without any [[constriction]] of the [[mind]] or paralysis or freaking out or anything like that. It's really a practice, but it's a genuine possibility.</span>

##### Fleeing from fear makes the fear increase
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^4-1" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^4-1" class="internal-link">4-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (4) · <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> (4)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So usually the relationship, as I said, to [[fear]], is [[aversion]], and it's fleeing the unpleasant. That fleeing actually makes the [[fear]] increase. The [[aversion]] is not something neutral. This is really important. So our [[aversion]] to things is not a neutral element. When we flee [[fear]], which is understandable, but when we flee it, when we're <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">averse to it</a>, it actually makes the [[fear]] increase. It makes it feel more difficult.</span>

---
##### When we flee we go straight up into the mind
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^4-2" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^4-2" class="internal-link">4-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> · <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2) · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">This fleeing, this [[aversion]], is part of the constellation of [[fear]]. When we flee the physical sensations, where do we flee to? We don't like the physical sensations, where do we go? We go straight up into the [[mind]], which is already spinning with thoughts. And that [[energy]] goes into the [[mind]], into the thinking, and just adds to the kind of whirlwind up there. The thoughts spiral. They're generally not helpful anyway at that point, and we get an increase in [[fear]].</span>

---
##### The aversion to fear is part of the fear itself
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^4-3" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^4-3" class="internal-link">4-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (9) · <a data-href="Anxiety" class="internal-link">Anxiety</a> (4) · <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> (4)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">This reaction to [[fear]] and [[anxiety]], the reaction to [[anxiety]] is actually _part of_ the [[anxiety]] itself. It's not that there's [[anxiety]], and now I have whatever reaction to it. The [[fear]] of the [[fear]], the fleeing of it, the [[aversion]] to it, is actually part of the [[fear]] itself. They're not two separate things. If I can learn through practice to really welcome the sensations of [[fear]], I'm actually taking away that reaction of [[aversion]], and I'll see, through practice, the [[fear]] cannot support itself. It cannot support itself without my reaction of [[aversion]]. It cannot. And not to take my word for it - to see in one's own practice: [[fear]] needs my [[fear]] of it. <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> needs my [[aversion]] to it. Otherwise it cannot support itself.</span>

##### Judging of myself adds fuel to the fire of fear
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^4-4" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^4-4" class="internal-link">4-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (5)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So, to see, when [[fear]] is around, because it's very normal, it's very human: am I putting a pressure on it? Am I pushing it away? A pressure for it to be different? Am I judging myself that it's around? "Boy, I'm really going backward now. I'm a crappy meditator, should probably just leave these good people to get on with it and go home." What am I telling myself? What am I concluding about the presence of [[fear]]? That judging of myself is putting a pressure on, and that pressure is another factor that will build the [[fear]]. It's another factor that adds fuel to the fire of [[fear]]. What am I thinking, what am I believing it says about me, that there's [[fear]] there?</span>

---
##### The actual mechanism of fear is very human
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^4-5" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^4-5" class="internal-link">4-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (7) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (3) · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> (3)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So rather, can we actually shift and see the humanity of [[fear]]? That it's such a human thing to have [[fear]], it's actually built into our - I don't know, genetic make-up or whatever. It's built into our biology. It's very human. It's true that a lot of it is unhelpful and irrelevant. But the actual mechanism of [[fear]] is very human. Can we actually just open to the fact of the humanity of it? And bring some <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a> to ourselves, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> to oneself. At that moment when I have [[fear]], I'm giving <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> to myself, who is [[the self]] right now? Self is with [[fear]]. That's who I am. And so it's not [[the self]] when this [[fear]] goes. It's [[the self]] right now with the [[fear]].</span>

##### Fear of how to take care of the future
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^4-6" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^4-6" class="internal-link">4-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (3) · <a data-href="Future thinking" class="internal-link">Future thinking</a> · <a data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">Pleasantness</a> · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">On a sort of larger scale, you know, we think about [[fear]] in our lives, and how much of it is actually unnecessary and irrelevant and really not helpful, really just getting in the way. And think how much [[fear]] is there because of [[future thinking]], worrying about the future: will I be okay? Will this happen? Will that _not_ happen? Whatever. A huge, really deep part of practice is actually asking ourselves, "I'm worried about the future. I notice [[fear]] of the future. Do I actually know, genuinely, how to take care of the future, what that really, really, really means, to take care of the future? What is it that leads to our <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a> and [[happiness]], really, _really_?"</span>

---
##### What is it that leads to well-being?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^4-7" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^4-7" class="internal-link">4-7</a>**: _<a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">Pleasantness</a> (4) · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Anxiety" class="internal-link">Anxiety</a> · <a data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">Contraction</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">To really understand what leads to [[happiness]], what takes care of the future, to understand that deeply, not just intellectually, in the cells, in the bones, that's, to me, a sign of very mature practice. So, you know, we're inundated with all this advertising, or you need this, you need that. And just the basic things which most of us take for granted, or even want a nice house, or a nice relationship, a nice career and this and that. And just to really understand, _really_, what is it that leads to [[happiness]], what is it that leads to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a>? The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> puts enormous emphasis on this question, really <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> and really living this question: what is it that leads to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a>? So all the things that we can get off track with that - what other people think of me, or, you know, it's endless. What other people think of me does not lead to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a>, cannot lead to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a>. No way. It only leads to a repetition of [[anxiety]] and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a>.</span>

##### It's the cultivation of beautiful qualities of mind and heart
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^5-1" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^5-1" class="internal-link">5-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">Habit</a> · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So what _does_ lead to [[happiness]]? How _do_ we take care of the future? And the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> talks about this. It's through the [[cultivation]] of those beautiful qualities of [[mind]] and heart. They will be our treasure, our fruit, throughout our life and at our deathbed. So what we're doing here, building [[love]] and [[compassion]] as <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a> of the [[mind]] and the heart, this is the real treasure. And you know, all the other lists, [[mindfulness]], [[equanimity]], and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, and this and that.</span>

##### Cultivation will take care of the future, also in relationship to the present
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^5-2" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^5-2" class="internal-link">5-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph"><a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> will take care of the future, and also in relationship to the present. We worry about the future, but if the relationship to the present is okay, is open, interested, present, alive, caring, then the future tends to take care of itself. And as I say, I really do think it's a sign of real maturity in practice to really know that and live that. It's quite rare. There's so much else that can distract us and pull us into, "No, I need this. This is what I need. This is the security I need. This is what I need to take care of." So it's really, really some maturity in practice to be clear about this. And it can move to a place where there's just much much less worry about, "Will I be secure when I get old? Will there be enough money? Will I be alone? Will my partner leave? Will they die? Will this, that, that, that, that?"</span>

##### Fear is important in relationship to love

<span class="paragraph">Okay, anyway, as I said, that was a bit of a tangent! [laughter] But [[fear]] _is_ important in relationship to [[love]], and it's important anyway as human beings.</span>

##### 3 possibilities + anatta
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^5-4" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^5-4" class="internal-link">5-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (2) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (4) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anatta</a> (3) · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So what I want to look at is, as I said, how to incorporate [[insight]] into <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice. We can incorporate it and kind of use it as something that feeds and nourishes the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> in a way as a sort of background to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice, can bring it in. So when we open up this door, how [[insight]] feeds <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> and [[compassion]], it's actually huge. The possibilities are, don't know if they're endless, but there's a ton in there. So I just want to draw out maybe three possibilities, and talk a little bit about this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>, what John talked about the other day and what we're mentioning quite a lot: this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a>, this [[emptiness]] of self, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">no-self</a>.</span>

##### Metta practice can lead to the dissolving of the boundaries between self and other
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^5-5" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^5-5" class="internal-link">5-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Oneness" class="internal-link">Oneness</a> (4) · <a data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">Nondualism</a> · <a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph"><a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a>, the development of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> - some of you have already mentioned a little bit, but anyway, just as a long-term view - this practice of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> can lead in the practice to a kind of dissolving of the boundaries between self and other. And there's a kind of, at times, and not to grasp at this, at times, through the practice, through the deepening of the practice, there's a kind of dissolution and a kind of [[oneness]] that comes in. And there's just a sense of [[oneness]]. Self and other, instead of that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a> there's a [[oneness]] there. And this is hugely valuable to the practice. I mean, it's a really beautiful thing for the heart to be able to have a sense of and open to, at times. It's not that we will _live_ in a state of [[oneness]], because that's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a> too.</span>

##### The "three characteristics"
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^5-6" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^5-6" class="internal-link">5-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anatta</a> (5) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Three characteristics" class="internal-link">Three characteristics</a> (3) · <a data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">Phenomenon</a> · <a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (4)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">But <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a> is a little bit different. There's a little bit, slightly different emphasis in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>, and it can be tricky to understand it. The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> talks about something called the '[[three characteristics]],' which some of you may have heard of, and others maybe it might be new. <a data-href="Three characteristics" class="internal-link">Three characteristics</a> of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a>, [[three characteristics]] of experiences, of things. And they are: **(1)** [[impermanence]], change, **(2)** [[dukkha]] or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">unsatisfactoriness</a>, **(3)** and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a> (<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a>, not me, not mine). And I'll go into these a little bit. So [[impermanence]], <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">unsatisfactoriness</a> ([[dukkha]]), and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a> (<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>).</span>

<span class="paragraph">I don't particularly buy that. I don't think it's really helpful for practice, okay?

But that's not any end point, and it's not even that it has to be there in a dramatic way. Sometimes people begin contemplating [[impermanence]], etc., and they start getting really frantic about things, and take that as a view that "Wow, my practice must really be going deep now." And actually it's just [[aversion]] and [[fear]] that's kicked in; it's not really that helpful.</span>

The basic practice, what we're doing, there are no problems with that. You don't have to go complicating it if it feels like this is a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">complication</a>, or if you're feeling like "I'm not doing it right" or anything like that. What I'm really doing is just offering some possibilities. And in a way, for some people, they will be workable because of previous practice or whatever. For others, it will just be a sense of possibilities for the future; possibilities, maybe a sense of how deep this practice of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> can actually go, the levels to which it can be taken. I feel like it's important to put out what the possibilities of practice are, even if they don't feel realizable and accessible for me right now, just so that we don't diminish what the possibilities of practice are. So if you're listening and it just feels like, "Interesting, but no, thank you. Forget it," that's completely fine. But also to feel free maybe sometimes to experiment with some of this.</span>

##### Remembering death

<span class="paragraph">**(1)** So, first one: **[[impermanence]]**. All of these, there are many ways to go about them. <a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a>. One level of meaning is contemplating, being aware of, remembering, [[death]] and the context of our life being so short in the context of the universe and the spans of the universe. So remembering [[death]]. Just an aside, but the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> was saying, "Monks, you should remember [[death]]" or whatever, and one monk said, "Every day I remember [[death]]," and he said, "Very good, but not good enough." [laughter] And then another monk said, I don't know, "Every morning and evening I remember [[death]]." He said, "Very good, but not good enough," and so it went on. And a monk said, I don't know, "Every time I walk somewhere I remember [[death]]." And another monk said, "Every time I exhale I remember [[death]]." "Good, very good, but not good enough." And then a monk said, "Every time I inhale and every time I exhale I remember [[death]]." And the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> said, "Very good." [laughter]</span>

##### This moment here is in the context of death

<span class="paragraph">What it's pointing to is wearing some lenses that lead to [[freedom]], through which we look at life. This is what is interesting. It's not just something that, "Oh, yeah, I remember this thing we're supposed to think about, [[impermanence]] and [[death]], occasionally." It's actually looking at the current moment through the lens of [[impermanence]]. So one meaning of [[impermanence]] is [[death]] and what I might call vastnesses of time. I think the universe is 13.7 billion years old, which is, you know, just a really long time! [laughter] It's staggeringly vast. Our lives are incredibly short, you know, sixty years if we're lucky, eighty, a hundred if we're really lucky. It's tiny. Can we actually see this moment right now, right now, this moment, through the lens of our [[death]]? We don't know what came before. Theories and religious theories aside, we don't know what comes afterwards. ==This moment here - colour, light, sound - is in the context of [[death]] and that kind of vastness. Can you get a sense of the moment through that lens?==</span>

<span class="paragraph">Now, this is a practice. This is one possibility of practice. Sometimes that will bring up [[fear]], but sometimes there's a way of just being with it that actually it opens up into something else. And that's what we're interested in, this opening up into something else. We're not particularly interested in building [[fear]], like I said.</span>

##### Impermanence of my self as door into anatta
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^7-6" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^7-6" class="internal-link">7-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Death" class="internal-link">Death</a> · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a> (2) · <a data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anatta</a> · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So there's [[death]], there's the vastness, there's the contemplation of all of us being subject to uncertainty. When, if through our <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a> practice or whatever, we're actually contemplating [[impermanence]], we have a current of that contemplation going on, what we can notice is a very rapid kind of [[impermanence]]. And this is one of the doors, and for some it's the easiest door, actually, into <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>. When I look at myself, what I call my self and my life, my sense of it at first sight, the sense of [[the self]] is something fixed and something that's lasting. I'm the same self that I was yesterday, and that I was twenty years ago, and I will be the same in twenty years' time. But when I look more closely, more microscopically, I actually can't find anything there that stays the same, that doesn't change. Everything is changing. You can get a sense that this self, it's not what I think it is. There's nothing that I could find that's fixed in that way.</span>

---
##### The unfindability of a fixed sense gives way for space where metta can come in
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^7-7" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^7-7" class="internal-link">7-7</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (4) · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So again, if one's used to contemplating in this way particularly, sometimes in the course of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice you can just bring in that contemplation. So in a way, one's sitting or walking, doing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, and just a little bit more space to the [[awareness]], including the change that's going on right then, the moment-to-moment change and the unfindability of self, the unfindability of a fixed self. In that space of what opens up, because the sense of solidity of self has given way a little bit, in that space, again, more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> can come in. It's possible, a whole other level of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> can come in. Possible to explore, possible to play with.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Another possibility. I'm just going through a lot of territory very quickly. Really, just to let go of what doesn't feel relevant, and maybe to take a few pieces or one piece or whatever. With [[impermanence]], when I look again at my [[experience]] and what I call my self, all I actually see is a [[perception]]. A [[perception]] of a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> sensation, a [[perception]] of a sight, a sound. I can't find anything else but <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a> of things. Or a thought or an emotion. All I see - there's nothing else. To have a [[perception]] requires some thing to perceive. And I see: I can't find a self, and all I find is these moments of [[perception]]. It's almost as if 'I,' the 'I' is nothing else but these moments of [[perception]]. Because [[perception]] takes a world to perceive, outer or inner, it means that this self, being only [[perception]], is not separate from the world. This is not easy to understand, I know, but all I see is moments of [[perception]]. Those moments of [[perception]] are part of the world and part of me. I cannot separate. If I can open to that sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">non-separation</a>, in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">non-separation</a> comes the [[love]], a whole deeper sense of [[love]], possibility, and of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a>. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">First characteristic</a>: [[impermanence]] and change, [[death]].</span>

##### We are all in the same boat with dukkha
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^8-2" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^8-2" class="internal-link">8-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (5) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12291/20070127-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-from_insight_to_love-12291.mp3#t=39:54" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(2)** Second one, **[[dukkha]]**. So this means <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">unsatisfactoriness</a> or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in its very broad sense. One reflection is that, again, we're actually all in the same boat with this. We're all subject to [[dukkha]], subject to the difficulties of life, to the struggles of life, to the problems and the sufferings of life. Sometimes just dropping that thought in - so this is much simpler now - you're doing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, and you just drop in the thought of, "We share that. We are all in the same boat with [[dukkha]]. It's a factor of life. It's a fact of existence." And just dropping in this sense of, "We are all in the same boat." What does that do to the heart? What will that do to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>?</span>

##### When there's clinging, the heart closes, when the clinging goes, the heart centre opens
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^8-3" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^8-3" class="internal-link">8-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> (7) · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> · <a data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">Centre</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">As I mentioned in one of the talks, can also begin to notice something with [[clinging]]. So '[[clinging]]' meaning constricting ourselves around something, pushing something away because we don't like it, because it's unpleasant, pulling it towards us. '<a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a>' - that whole thing. Can notice: when the [[clinging]] is there, what happens to the heart? So just to notice this. It's like an experiment. When there's [[clinging]], the heart closes, sometimes just a little bit. And you can actually feel that. Sometimes just to put the [[awareness]] in the [[centre]] of the chest area, just very lightly, and notice: when there's [[clinging]] there, there's a slight closing, or a large closing. When the [[clinging]] goes, the heart [[centre]] opens. Just to notice that.</span>

---
##### Doing metta with the awareness of whether there's clinging
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^8-4" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^8-4" class="internal-link">8-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> · <a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> (5) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So another possibility is to be doing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice or the [[compassion]] practice when we move to it, to be in the moment doing that, again, broaden the [[attention]] a little bit, and just be aware of if there is [[clinging]] to anything - to a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> sensation, to a sound, pushing it away, struggling with something, to an emotion, whatever, to a train of thought. Is there [[clinging]] there? And if there is, is it possible to actually just relax and release that [[clinging]]? And in so doing, the heart opens. So to be doing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice with actually a slightly larger sense of [[awareness]] that's aware of whether there's [[clinging]] or not and just releasing. Just keep releasing the [[clinging]] as a way of opening the heart.</span>

---
##### The body will reflect when clinging is around
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^8-5" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^8-5" class="internal-link">8-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (3) · <a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> (2) · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So that's, in itself, a practice to do that. The way in usually is to have, again, this sensitivity to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a>, a subtle sense, a sensitivity to the subtle sort of sense of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a>. That subtle <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of the body</a> will reflect when [[clinging]] is around. It will cramp up or constrict, sometimes in very subtle ways. Can pick up on that in the slightly broader [[awareness]] as one's doing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> and just relax it. In so doing, the [[clinging]] relaxes, the struggle relaxes, and the heart opens.</span>

<span class="paragraph">When there's a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">push and pull</a> of [[clinging]], we're <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a> what we don't like, what's unpleasant, or pulling towards ourselves what we want, what's pleasant, when that's going on there is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> with what's pleasant or unpleasant. That's the [[insight]] of this characteristic. That's the [[insight]] of [[dukkha]]. The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> depends not on the thing. It depends on the struggle, on the push or the pull. To feel this and to see it. When there's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">push and pull</a> there, there's [[constriction]], there's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>.

##### With more open space with metta, the actual sense of self quietens
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^9-2" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^9-2" class="internal-link">9-2</a>**: _<a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> (5) · <a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> (3) · <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">Nondualism</a> (2) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> · <a data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anatta</a> · <a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">But as I mentioned the other day, [[the self]], [[the self]]-sense, the ego-sense, is empty. It doesn't exist by itself, of its own steam, of its own support. It actually depends on struggling with something, on [[clinging]], on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a> or pulling. It needs that food. And we can see: as we're in this more open space with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, let go of some [[clinging]] if you feel it, if it's possible. Just relax that, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> sense, relax the [[clinging]]. The actual <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a> quietens, and the quietening of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a>, the quietening of the sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a> from other, because self and other go together. Less <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a>, more [[love]].

##### We are neither aiming to dissolve the self nor merge with the One

<span class="paragraph">**(3)** And then we can go into the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a> in a more direct way, this **<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>** in a more direct way, the third characteristic in a more direct way. This is important to understand: we're not trying to destroy [[the self]], like ego destruction, or get rid of [[the self]], or dissolve it in some way, or even merge it into some cosmic sense of something. Sometimes, and in really deep practice, there _can_ be a sense of just merging into a [[oneness]] or merging into a kind of infinite [[love]]. And at very deep levels, that's possible. That possibility is a treasure. It's something really to be valued and explored in very deep practice. But it's not quite the same as <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>, what we're aiming for, valuable as it is. Rather, we want to understand something. We want to understand something about this self, and understand it in a way that it brings [[freedom]].</span>

##### Understanding anatta takes time

<span class="paragraph">And it's difficult - it takes time to understand this concept of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>. It's not something that comes easy or simple. Even if we can kind of get it intellectually, to really get it at a heart level where it's making a difference to our lives is something that takes time. Absolutely, it takes time. So not to worry that, "Oh, I'm not <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> this yet" or whatever. It really takes time, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>. Or "What a terrible practice I have because I don't understand it yet."</span>

<span class="paragraph">There's a story from the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Judaism" data-href="Judaism" class="internal-link">Jewish tradition</a>. It was Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, which is the holiest day in the year, and when you sort of - what's the word? - open your heart and your wrongdoings, etc., to God, and the forgiveness of that. It's the holiest day of the year. And it was in the synagogue, and the rabbi's there, and everyone was praying. He suddenly sinks to the floor and starts beating his chest and saying, "I am nothing! I am nothing!" And then the cantor, the guy who leads the singing and the choir, then _he_ sinks to the floor and starts beating his chest, "I am nothing! I am nothing!" And then the janitor, the guy who cleans the toilets and things, _he_ sinks to the floor, "I am nothing! I am nothing!" And so the cantor turns to the rabbi and says, "Look who thinks he's nothing!"

<span class="paragraph">There's a way of all this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a> business where actually [[the self]] just grabs hold of it and makes a whole other, "I'm more selfless than you." Or "I understand" or whatever. Not to grasp too tightly. It really, really, really does take time to understand it. And there are all kinds of levels of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>. We're just putting it out there, and whatever way that it can find its way in is fine.</span>

##### With anatta we are working with the "me-mine" experience
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^10-2" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^10-2" class="internal-link">10-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anatta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a> (2) · <a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> (2) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Hell" class="internal-link">Hell</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>, again, practising [[ways of looking]] that lead to [[freedom]], that lead to release, and that lead to [[love]]. With <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>, working with it directly, it's a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a> at [[experience]]. Usually we look at [[experience]], a thought comes up, either we're completely identified with it and we say it's 'me' or it's 'mine.' Or a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> sensation is there, it's 'me' or 'mine.' Or an emotion, 'me' or 'mine.' Sometimes we're actually conscious that we're doing that. We're conscious that we're saying, "Yeah, of course it's me and mine. Of course it's my knee. Who the [[hell]] else's knee is it?!" [laughter] Or, "Of course it's my thought." Sometimes it's very conscious. Most of the time, it goes on without us even being aware of it. We're just saying me-mine, me-mine, me-mine, me-mine - virtually uninterrupted throughout our life.</span>

##### "Just unhook" is not a metaphysical statement
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^10-3" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^10-3" class="internal-link">10-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Present moment" class="internal-link">Present moment</a> · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Metaphysics" class="internal-link">Metaphysics</a> · <a data-href="Nature" class="internal-link">Nature</a> · <a data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anatta</a> · <a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So what the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> is saying is not so much a sense of making a philosophical statement: "There is a self" or "There isn't a self." And actually, he tended to ignore that question, said it's not the appropriate question. He'd say, rather, can you practise in a certain way? And that way is, can you look at the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Present moment" data-href="Present moment" class="internal-link">present moment experience</a> and actually just unhook the 'me' and 'mine'? So 'me' and 'mine' goes and puts its hook of identification into everything. And all the difficulty and all the problem that comes out of that. He says, can you just unhook and regard the moment's [[experience]], the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> sensation, the thought, the emotion, whatever it is, as not me, not mine? So he's not making any <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metaphysics" data-href="Metaphysics" class="internal-link">metaphysical</a> statement about the [[nature]] of self or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">no self</a> or whatever. He's pointing to a way of practising that leads to [[freedom]]. And it really is a practice. It takes some time.</span>

##### The comparing, judging mind
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^10-4" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^10-4" class="internal-link">10-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2) · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So again, a number of people have mentioned, and it's very common because it's very human, a kind of judging [[mind]] come in. And often it's judging of ourselves. And the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind" data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">comparing mind</a> comes into, in this case, the [[retreat]] situation. In a way, a [[retreat]] is just a mirror of what goes on in our lives; it's just we're seeing a bit more closely the kinds of thoughts that we have anyway, the comparing, the judging.</span>

##### The self-sense gets its energy from measuring, comparing, judging
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^10-5" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^10-5" class="internal-link">10-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhanas</a> · <a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> · <a data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Awakening</a> · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> (2) · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a> · <a data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">Nondualism</a> · <a data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">Ignorance</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So we're sitting here, and we think, "God, I bet that everyone else is probably in the 134th <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a> by now." [laughter] "And I'm still struggling away with the [[hindrances]]" or whatever. Or, "Actually, they're probably all <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightened</a>, and they could probably all go home. They're just staying so that I don't feel too bad." [laughter] Or whatever. This is very common, you know. And often it's us we put down, or it's others. You know, it's others, and we look at someone, and we say, "Call yourself a meditator?" or whatever. It comes in either way. It's the same deal. Comparing, measurement, judgment - this is part of what [[the self]]-sense is. It's like the other side of the coin of [[the self]]-sense. It's what self-sense does. In a way, it _has_ to do it. Self, you could say self feeds on measurement. It gets its _oomph_ and its [[energy]] from measuring, from comparing, from judging. That's how it actually creates a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a> between this and that, "This is me, and that isn't." And it does it by comparing, by measuring. To establish a difference between self and other, I need to compare, I need to judge. So it's woven very tightly into the fabric of what self-sense is and what it is to be human, really. And woven into [[ignorance]].</span>

##### Over time, the groove of metta will be more established than the groove of measuring, comparing, judging
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^11-1" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^11-1" class="internal-link">11-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (7) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2) · <a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a> · <a data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">Kusala</a> (2) · <a data-href="Acceptance" class="internal-link">Acceptance</a> · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a> (3) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Not to underestimate the power of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> for working with this. So judgment thoughts, comparing thoughts, they're thoughts. And there's a certain groove that the [[mind]] gets into, comparing, judging. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Mettā</a> is another thought. And gradually, one <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a> at what we're doing is establishing another groove, a much more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> and helpful groove to the [[mind]], that's actually about connection and [[acceptance]] and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>, not judgment, not comparison. Slowly, over time, the groove of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> will be more established than the groove of comparison and judgment and measurement. And that's a real possibility. In the moment when comparison is happening, to kick the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice in, to inject a bit more [[energy]] into the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice is also helpful, because it's like using the thinking that's already going on, and just saying, "I'll use the thinking [[energy]] because it's already going on, but I'll use it in a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> way. And I'll just plug away at that until the comparing and all that begins to lose [[energy]]." So really to trust the power of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice, and the [[compassion]] as we get on to it.</span>

##### Judgement thoughts are not me, not mine

<span class="paragraph">At a deeper level, though, the judgment thoughts, again, they're not me, not mine. It's like thoughts are just arising out of nowhere and disappearing back into nowhere. It's like having a radio on a very bad radio station, that's just putting out these thoughts. They're not me, not mine. The more, in time, we can practise seeing our thoughts that way, the more freeing. And we can really have a [[freedom]] from judgment in life, a [[freedom]] from believing or being involved in any of that stuff. Nothing that I'm talking about today is abstract. I'm talking about very real possibilities. It's completely possible for everyone in this room to be totally free of judgment, self-judgment, of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind" data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">comparing mind</a>, of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind" data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">measuring mind</a>. It's a very real possibility of practice.</span>

##### The emptiness that opens up from "not me, not mine" is inbued with love
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^11-3" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^11-3" class="internal-link">11-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (2) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (3) · <a data-href="Three characteristics" class="internal-link">Three characteristics</a> · <a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a> · <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So the 'not me, not mine' is looking at the moment's experience, and just quietly regarding it as 'not me, not mine,' whether it's a thought or a body sensation. So again, you're doing the mettā, you can just, if you have a little skill already in this area, or if it already seems to be happening, experiment. You're doing the mettā, you're doing the compassion. A bit more space. What else is happening? Body sensation, thought, whatever, just seeing it as 'not me, not mine.' Including the awareness, because we also will then have an identification with awareness, which is a more subtle identification. We can let go of that identification. And that emptiness that opens up will be imbued with love. If it's not imbued with love, something's a little bit off balance with the practice, a little bit barking up the wrong tree. So with these three characteristics, one of the indicators that they're working properly is that they bring freedom and love, and not a sense of coldness and disconnection or fear, as I said before.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And similarly, it's actually possible to direct the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, the [[compassion]], towards other, another person, and actually regard _them_ as, whatever is happening, their [[experience]] is 'not me, not mine' in their case.

It may be a possibility that you may be able to work with some of that, a little piece, one or two pieces. Partly it's important, I feel, just for this stuff to be out there, just for people to have a sense of the possibilities of the depth of the practice and the breadth of the practice. And may be something that you want to revisit. Three weeks may seem like a long time, but it's actually a very short amount of time in relation to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> and [[compassion]] - and particularly <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> and [[compassion]] as a path to [[awakening]].</span>

<span class="paragraph">Yogi: Regarding [[impermanence]] and contemplating on [[death]]. Various readings and other things I've gotten in the past suggest sometimes to consider different circumstances of your [[death]], to help remain [?] preciousness of the moment. Thinking about different ways of dying, I often ponder - some of the recreational <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a> I have put me at risk a lot. And I think about what would that be like, falling off a cliff or things like that. And I find it really centres me sometimes. Other times, it brings that [[fear]] up a lot again.

<span class="paragraph">Rob: You can talk about that kind of contemplation of [[death]] as a separate thing. So let's talk about that first. Sometimes in the contemplation of [[death]] - and I think it should be part of practice, so it's not something morbid. And people think, "Hmm, I don't want to do that. It's a bit depressing." Sometimes in doing that, it will bring a real <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centring</a>, a real sense of the preciousness of life, the [[beauty]] of it, the [[wonder]] of it. Sometimes it will bring up [[fear]].</span>

<span class="paragraph">I would say just in terms of that practice, to keep working with it until it brings almost a sense of [[freedom]] with it as well - preciousness and [[freedom]]. And the [[fear]] is just a stage that one works through. In the context of what I've been talking about today, bringing it into the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice, if it brings up the [[fear]], it's not the right thing to bring in at the moment. So you might bring it in and it actually brings a sense of preciousness, of the gift of life or whatever, and in that sense can deepen in [[love]]. But if you bring it in and actually it's just stirring up some [[fear]] and stuff, it's actually going to close the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> down a little bit, and I would leave it for that time and go to something, either come back to a very basic <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice or find some other contemplation that will help. So again, to reiterate, just being with the basic practice, there's already plenty, so you don't necessarily have to start adding things. I'm just putting it out there.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**Q2: [[three characteristics]] implying each other**</span>

---
##### Does understanding one help understanding the others?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^12-7" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^12-7" class="internal-link">12-7</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: Does the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> of one characteristic lead to helping the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> of the other characteristics?</span>

---
##### Something is impermanent, therefore automatically unsatisfactory
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^12-8" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^12-8" class="internal-link">12-8</a>**: _<a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a> · <a data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anatta</a> · <a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a> (7) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (2) · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Yeah, absolutely. People generally tend to have a favourite - it's the one they can kind of understand the easiest, and also their particular one that leads to a sense of [[freedom]] for them. And I don't know if human beings are roughly divided into three. I have no idea. [laughter] But they probably aren't, is my guess. The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a> one directly is a bit more difficult to understand. So for example, as I was saying, with [[impermanence]], if we just take [[impermanence]], which is probably the easiest one to understand for most people. <a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a> obviously is [[impermanence]], so everyone understands that. If I see that things are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a>, I begin to see that they cannot give me a reliable sense of satisfaction; they cannot fulfil me in any ultimate or lasting way. So I begin to get an [[insight]] into the [[dukkha]] characteristic, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">unsatisfactoriness</a>. If I'm contemplating [[impermanence]], something comes up, some moment, [[experience]], a thought or an emotion or a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> sensation, and I can see: it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a>, therefore automatically it's unsatisfactory in that sense.</span>

##### The resulting letting go is not disconnection, and it can lead to an understanding of anatta

<span class="paragraph">These contemplations are not big - at first they might be quite cumbersome, like, "This big contemplation. I'm going to plunk it down on my practice, and it's this big thing." It can get to the point that it's almost like wearing some glasses - you don't even realize you have them on. It's very light, very just in the moment [snaps fingers] that's how were seeing, and there's a freedom that comes with it. If I see impermanence and I have a sense of unsatisfactoriness, there's a letting go there. I let go, I let go. And again, it doesn't lead to any coldness or disconnection from life. There's actually a warmth that goes with that. And then impermanence might lead to a sense of, an understanding of anattā, because, like I said, I look and I can't find anything that's not changing. I absolutely cannot find anything that does not change. The sense of self is fixed, lasting, permanent, steady. And I look inside, and all I see is impermanence, so therefore no fixed self. It's not really real in the way that I thought it was. All I can say there _is_ is a continuum of mind moments, a continuum of experiences through time. So impermanence can lead to the others like that.</span>

##### Is it a lower level of understanding if I do not approach a characteristic directly?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^13-2" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^13-2" class="internal-link">13-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: Okay, I understand all that. Let's say [[impermanence]] is what I understand. And maybe I'm just judging on some level - the other two characteristics, are they going to be at a lower level of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>?</span>

---
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Than if you did them directly?</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: Yeah, than if they came directly. Is that just a judging [[mind]]?</span>

---
##### Yes, it might be, but we are interested in freedom, rather than a certain badge
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^13-5" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^13-5" class="internal-link">13-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (4) · <a data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anatta</a> (4) · <a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a> (2) · <a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a> (4)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: It might be. I don't know. You'd have to answer that. I feel that the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a> through [[impermanence]] is not quite at the same level of depth of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> as <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a> directly. But it can be enough to free, and it's [[freedom]] we're interested in, rather than a certain badge of whatever. It may be enough. And if that's your one, and if that's what works for you for <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>, that can bring enough [[freedom]]. ==But there are ways of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a> that go even beyond the notion of [[impermanence]], a whole other depth. If that's accessible, then that's great; if it's not, it's fine. There's enough [[freedom]]. There's plenty of [[freedom]] in that.==</span>

##### Can the more direct understanding come from more practice?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^13-6" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^13-6" class="internal-link">13-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anatta</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: And can the second way of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a> come through more practice? Or what brings this about?</span>

---
##### Yes, more practice, certain questions, orientation, relationships
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^13-7" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^13-7" class="internal-link">13-7</a>**: _<a data-href="Relationships" class="internal-link">Relationships</a> · <a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a> · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Yeah, more practice, and certain kinds of orientation in the practice, asking certain questions, looking at certain [[relationships]]. Or, for instance, practising directly in this way of regarding things as not me, not mine. Which you may be able to move towards through the [[impermanence]], in the sense "I can't find anything, therefore it doesn't belong to any fixed <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a>, therefore it's not me, not mine." But working in that more direct way can bring a bit more depth. I don't know if everyone would agree with that, teachers and whatnot, but that's my view.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Yogi: If you're working with [[dukkha]] and [[clinging]], and you're [[letting go]] of the [[clinging]] and sort of, like you said, sense sort of an open heart, sometimes it can be that you notice a deeper level of [[clinging]], kind of deeper. When you're practising <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> and you want to bring that into your practice … I'm not sure what the question is, really, but …</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Just to amplify a little bit what Rachel said: in working with this characteristic of [[dukkha]] directly, there is an [[awareness]] of [[clinging]] in the sense of what's going on. There's a [[contraction]], and one relaxes that. Then there can be a sense of release, relief. Then what might show itself is a kind of more subtle, deeper level of [[clinging]]. And then one could just go on in this way. And the [[mind]], the [[awareness]] just deepens and deepens and deepens. That on its own is an absolutely fantastic way to practise. It's just a deepening and more and more release, more and more calming. It goes back and forth between opening and a sense of [[contraction]], opening and a sense of [[contraction]], at deeper and deeper levels.</span>

##### I wouldn't worry too much about the levels
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^14-6" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^14-6" class="internal-link">14-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (6) · <a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> (3) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (2) · <a data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">Spaciousness</a> · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So the question was: if it can go deeper and deeper levels, and you're in the context of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice, how do you know when to kind of, you know, jump off the elevator, so to speak? [laughter] It doesn't really matter. I would probably say, if you're opening your practice out a bit, just whatever [[clinging]] you notice, see if you can let go in that. And then, rather, pick up on the [[love]] that's there and be in the [[love]] with a slightly more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a> [[awareness]]. Then you'll notice more [[clinging]], perhaps, and you can let go of that. Or you may just want to do it a little bit just as a way of kind of kick-starting some <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>. The heart's opening because there's less [[clinging]], because you've let go of it, and you're just accessing some <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, and then you can leave it at that and just be in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>. And maybe revisit it occasionally. But I wouldn't worry too much about the levels. In this context, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> is the important thing. So you're just using it as a way of deepening the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>. You understand? Does that answer? Okay, good.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**Q4: [[fear]] increasing when hearing teachings about [[fear]], decreasing with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>**</span>

<span class="paragraph">Yogi: It's not exactly a question. It's just a reflection, really. I haven't been feeling any [[fear]] or [[anxiety]], but when you were talking about [[fear]] and [[anxiety]], I was noticing [?]. It's quite interesting, and then when you stopped talking about it, it went away! [laughter] There's no object [?].</span>

##### A lot of stuff goes on below the radar of consciousness
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^15-1" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^15-1" class="internal-link">15-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> · <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> · <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Hmm! [laughter] Yeah, could be that that could happen by the very mechanism that I was talking about. So that it's bringing it into [[mind]] - maybe there's a memory of it or an [[image]] of it as I'm talking about it. And then what's happening is a subtle [[aversion]] to it is kicking in, which is natural. And that's enough to start things spiralling. A lot of this stuff goes on below the radar of [[consciousness]]. So it's possible there was just the seed of it, and enough [[aversion]] kicked in, because that's what we do with [[fear]], that it started something. Very possible.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Yogi: Of course! [laughter]</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Sometimes it does, you know.</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi 2: I feel a bit similar actually when you were talking about [[fear]]. [?] Because I hadn't been aware of [[fear]] either, and then when you mentioned [[fear]], it turned it on. I realized, a bit like Martin … [?] <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a>, sitting here doing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, it's not been around.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: And that's fine - you don't have to go looking for it now in the practice! [laughter] It's funny, as I was talking, I was aware of a strange feeling in the room as I was talking about it. Anyway. Yeah, it can, same thing. But how much of our [[fear]] is bound up with future? "What will happen? What will happen to me? Will it be okay? Will it not be?" To me, the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> talks about practice and [[awakening]] being the great security. Then there's the feeling, this is what we can really trust, this is where the security is. Over time, you know, all those other fears, they just … It's really a possibility. But, like I said, ==if there's no [[fear]] in practice, just steam right ahead. Don't worry about it.== Okay.</span>

[laughter] And I hadn't realized that's what I was doing, but that's what tended to happen. It wasn't going to [[anger]]; it would go to [[fear]]. And when someone mentioned that, and to almost say, "Look," when it came up, to kind of say, "No, I'm not going to go that way," and do <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>. Really helpful. The only thing, the question is, slightly, how do I know I'm not repressing some real [[fear]]?</span>

And I have, years ago, in my life, almost gone through a phase of years when it seemed like [[anxiety]] and [[fear]] became a [[habit]] of [[consciousness]]. Somehow something slipped into a kind of groove where that was - not a _default,_ but so common. And often there was nothing to be afraid of. There was nothing even happening. It just slipped into that. Or there were things that I amplified through [[fear]].</span>

And also in the realization this is a [[habit]], like - no one's too young to understand this analogy - like a record. [laughter] When I was a [[music]] student, as a graduate [[music]] student, they had a [[music]] library - this is completely an aside - and the [[music]] library had records and CDs that you could play, and go listen to whatever piece the teacher told you to listen to. And they had CD players there. This was in the States. And an undergraduate came in and had been given a record of something to play, to listen to, and was trying to fit it in the CD player. [laughter] He had never, he wasand had never seen a record before. And then completely [[mind]]-boggled that it actually had things on both sides. That's completely irrelevant! [laughter]</span>

<span class="paragraph">The sense of things getting into a groove. And how much of what our life is is just grooves. The [[mind]] gets into <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a>. They can be <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a>, like <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>. You can get into a groove of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, a [[habit]] of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, a [[habit]] of [[mindfulness]], a [[habit]] of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a>. And we can get into, of course, grooves of [[fear]], of judgment, of irritability, etc. And we either feed or starve them - those are <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s words. We feed or starve. And just to see that is already a huge [[insight]], just that much, that things, mental factors are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a> or not, that we can feed and starve. And things have [[relationships]]. Like I was talking about, [[fear]] and [[love]] have a relationship. We feed [[fear]], we starve [[love]], inherently in feeding [[fear]]. We feed [[love]] and we starve [[fear]]. To begin seeing that relationship. And then the other thing I was going to say, what do you mean "real [[fear]]"? So that's a real question. Real [[fear]] to me is there's a rhinoceros charging at me. Do you want to say a little bit more?</span>

##### Sometimes there are things to fear, often in the future
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^16-4" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^16-4" class="internal-link">16-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: No, I'm just interested because you described one way of working with [[fear]] and feeling it. And sometimes there are things, there are things to [[fear]]. Tends to be future things.</span>

##### Genuinlly, there is nothing to fear
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^16-5" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^16-5" class="internal-link">16-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> · <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (3) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Future thinking" class="internal-link">Future thinking</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Tends to be future. And as we go a bit more in the last week talking more about the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of things</a>, you actually see there really is nothing to [[fear]]. That is a very deep <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>. Genuinely, there is nothing to [[fear]]. There's no thing to [[fear]], and right now, yeah, it's caught up with [[future thinking]].</span>

##### Fear from wanting the future be a certain way
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^16-6" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^16-6" class="internal-link">16-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi 2: Isn't it depending on [[clinging]]? If in the [[mind]] you have a certain standard, a certain idea of what you want the future to be, then the [[fear]] is coming from what you want. But if there's no idea, there's no conditioning about I want my future to be a certain way.</span>

##### Cultivating positive qualities is helpful
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0127 From Insight to Love > ^16-7" data-href="0127 From Insight to Love#^16-7" class="internal-link">16-7</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> · <a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> (2) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">Steadiness</a> · <a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> · <a data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">Pleasantness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Totally. Can be [[fear]] of _not_ having something or having something. And there's a [[clinging]] to an idea of something. Some of that is good. We can <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a> to the idea of I want to grow in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, I want to grow in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a>. And if we hold it lightly enough, that's okay. It's an [[image]] of our future. Like I was saying, what do we need to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a>, to build, to establish <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a>, [[happiness]], whatever word you want to use? To establish <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a>. So some of that's okay and it's appropriate and it's wise and it's healthy.</span>
