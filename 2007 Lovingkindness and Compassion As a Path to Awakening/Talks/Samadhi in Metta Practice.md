[[Samadhi in Metta Practice -|plain list]]

##### Metta develops the heart, insight and samadhi
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^1-1" data-href="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice#^1-1" class="internal-link">1-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (3) · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12294/20070122-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-samadhi_in_metta_practice-12294.mp3#t=00:02" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So I'd like to talk a bit today about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, which is a word some of you may be familiar with. It's a Pali and a Sanskrit word, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>. And go into the meaning of that and the development of that and some different aspects and implications of it. When we were thinking about this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, we thought, one of the primary questions was, "Well, is it going to be helpful to people? Is it going to be worthwhile for people?" And I reflected on it a little bit, and I thought, "Well, people will develop <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, which is a lovely thing. They'll develop that quality of heart. And then, hopefully, there'll be the exposure, the chance to open to the kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a> that come from <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice. And then also there'll be the opportunity to develop <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>." So three possibilities, any of which, or any amount of which, are all completely worthwhile, would make this time here worthwhile to someone.</span>

##### Samadhi is often translated as "concentration"
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^1-2" data-href="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (5) · <a data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhism</a> · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12294/20070122-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-samadhi_in_metta_practice-12294.mp3#t=01:26" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So this word <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> in different traditions actually means different things. I'd just like to use it in quite a particular way. Traditionally - rather, in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddhism" data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhist tradition</a> - not maybe what the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> meant, but what has come out of that is actually that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice is something that's pretty much only good for <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>. I'll explain what that means. Also what's come to us through the tradition is that this word is usually translated as '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a>,' and with a particular meaning to the word '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a>,' meaning the way sort of laundry detergent is concentrated. [laughs] You know, it's like a lot of it in a very small space. [laughter] In other words, a very _narrow_ focus of the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, a kind of microscopic - looking at <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> through a microscope. And that has come to be implied in the word <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>.</span>

##### Better: "collectedness", even better: "unification"
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^1-3" data-href="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (5) · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> (2) · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (8) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (5)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12294/20070122-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-samadhi_in_metta_practice-12294.mp3#t=02:39" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Now, there is some benefit to being able to make the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> small and narrowly focused like that. There's a certain amount of power in it. But if one goes back to the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>, and looks through all the volumes of what he said, you can't actually find anything implying anything like that at all. For some reason, that's what's come to us. So rather, I would like to use <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> in what I feel is more the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s sense of the word, which is more something like '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness</a>': <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness of mind</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness of mind</a> and heart and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>. Something maybe even better: '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a>.' Because there's a sense - as John was talking last night - you know, often we're kind of out of contact with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, a little distant from the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, or the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> feel like two very separate things, disjointed. Or the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is just scattered here, memory, planning, worry, whatever it is, obsession. And so <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> is this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a> of the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> - <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a> of the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, and the heart.</span>

##### It's a continuum of depth and a lifelong exploration
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^1-4" data-href="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> (2) · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (3) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12294/20070122-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-samadhi_in_metta_practice-12294.mp3#t=03:57" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">One of my teachers uses the phrase, uses the translation, 'depth of <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>,' which I like very much. So <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> is really pointing to a sense of the <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> process, the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> sinking in a very lovely way into its depths, in the way that the sea is calm in its depths. Now, we can talk about a range of states of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, certainly. We can also talk about a continuum, a continuum of depth, a continuum of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a>. And this is, _I_ feel very much it's a lifelong exploration. So it's not just something that's a little bit, then we forget about. It's something that all of us as human beings have the potential to grow into and to explore, and usually it's a very gradual, very slow process of exploring.</span>

##### Perceptions expands when the consciousness deepens
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^2-1" data-href="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> (3) · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12294/20070122-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-samadhi_in_metta_practice-12294.mp3#t=05:02" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So it's an investigation, a lifelong investigation, exploration of the depths of <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>, of the depths available in <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>. Also of the kind of expanded <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a> that come about when the <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> deepens. And all of this, not to grasp too much at these words or the possibilities, but just to know that there are possibilities, and that we can move in a very lovely and gradual way to explore some of this.</span>

---
##### We need a sense of deep nourishment
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^2-2" data-href="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> (2) · <a data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">Beauty</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12294/20070122-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-samadhi_in_metta_practice-12294.mp3#t=05:34" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And why? Well, because it _is_ very lovely. It's really, really very lovely. Of the lovely things that are available to human beings, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> is really up there. But more than that - although that's already quite something - we _need_ a sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a> in life. We _need_ a sense of loveliness, a deep loveliness, deep <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a>. A <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Beauty" data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">sense of beauty</a> that comes with that, a sense of rest, and very _deep_ rest that comes with that. This is something we really, really need as human beings. We're generally pretty frazzled, pretty scattered, pretty undernourished on a heart, on a being level. And often we don't even realize that.</span>

##### With samadhi we are maximizing the receptivity of the mind
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^2-3" data-href="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (3) · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (3) · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> · <a data-href="Receptivity" class="internal-link">Receptivity</a> (2) · <a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12294/20070122-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-samadhi_in_metta_practice-12294.mp3#t=06:24" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So this rest then allows us to be actually more available to others, which of course is a big part of what <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> is about; more available to others, more available to ourselves, more available to life. And brings a freshness to life. It's almost like the quality of life actually can begin to feel like, or actually it _does_ increase as the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> learns to settle down that way. Freshness to life, fresh discoveries in life come out of this settledness of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a>. Fresh <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a>. And really a sense of <a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a> in that, so that our typical way of being in the world, which is, "I'm here, you're there, we're separate, I'm trundling along in my life," all this, this is part of the human condition, that with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> we're actually maximizing the <a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a> of the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> to other <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a> ourselves, seeing others, seeing life. And it's those other <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a> that are potentially liberating. So the significance of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> is actually huge. It's huge.</span>

##### Samadhi doesn't have to be with just one object
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^2-4" data-href="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice#^2-4" class="internal-link">2-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (5) · <a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (3) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2) · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12294/20070122-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-samadhi_in_metta_practice-12294.mp3#t=07:48" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Usually when people talk about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, they're talking about taking one object, like the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> - which we've now put aside, and working with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> - or the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> is one object. So in the instructions here, we're taking one object, which is the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, and just the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> staying with that as much as possible. And that's usually what's implied in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, staying with one object. But actually, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> in itself, in the broad sense, is something bigger than that, and it can be that we actually have a very _open_ <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, and not necessarily staying with one object, but there's a sense of this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a> happening because of the non-entanglement with things that come up. There's just a free, open, easy, and wise relationship with what's coming up. And that wise relationship brings the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a>, brings the depth of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>. It doesn't have to be just with one object. And perhaps as the <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> - in fact, _definitely_ as the <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> goes on, we'll be exploring what that means to open it up too.</span>

##### The mind is moving a lot, which is not conducive to calm
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^2-5" data-href="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice#^2-5" class="internal-link">2-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (3) · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12294/20070122-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-samadhi_in_metta_practice-12294.mp3#t=09:05" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Usually the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> moves - even if we're practising, you know, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a>, the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is on this, and then it's on that, and then it's on this. So the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is moving a lot. And oftentimes, even if we think we're being <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a>, the relationship with what we're <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a> of is actually not all that skilful. There is some degree of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a> what we don't like, or trying to hang on or something. It's not that skilful, not that conducive to depth of calm.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So of all the things that it's possible for a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a> to understand or master or have some skill in - you know, you can think, I don't know if you all know what the _<a data-href="Guinness Book of Records" class="internal-link">Guinness Book of Records</a>_ is? It's this sort of big book of weird things that people … [laughter] And they get famous because they can do that more or better or faster than anyone else. And so things like, you can stack coins on your elbow and then do _that_ [moves arm] and catch them all in one hand. And some people stack whatever, sixty coins and catch it. And some of it's pretty amazing, you know. [laughter] But if we really think … And actually, some things are very beautiful - the ballet or musical facility, or you see a great football player or basketball player, there's something, I feel, very deeply beautiful in that. But to really ask, actually: in this life, of all the things, the skills, the crafts that we could develop, what's really worth developing? And this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> is something that a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a>, it's one of their best friends to have some facility in that.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And we often underestimate its importance, and its power, and its significance, but if you look at the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s teachings, I mean, it's hard to just turn a few pages without him going on and on, it seems, just constantly repeating himself about the importance of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>.

So I'm pretty sure that will change just as the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> grows up in the West, but so far we've tended to sideline it.</span>

<span class="paragraph"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a> is important, as I said.

Just by itself, it brings <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a>. And not only that, but it's like the perfect soil for <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a> to grow in. So when there's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> there, it's really the optimum conditions for <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a> to occur. When the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is scattered and not unified, we can think we see something: "Ah yes, <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a>.

If there isn't that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, what tends to happen is we see it very clear, and then five minutes, five weeks, however long later, it doesn't seem to stick. Somehow it doesn't seem to stick. We've had the <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>, but it didn't seem to really make a difference to our life. One of the prime reasons for that is there isn't enough <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>. The soil wasn't quite right; it wasn't quite rich in the nutrients enough, wasn't quite enough moisture in the soil.</span>

<span class="paragraph">On the most sort of basic level, though, just the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness of practice</a> is really what begins to give life to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>.

<span class="paragraph">And in that <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> is the beginning of strength. And this strength is a factor that we really need in life. Sometimes we're just swamped and bowled over by what's happening. Or something happens, and we realize, "Gosh, I was so in it, and it seemed so huge." Why did it seem so huge, and later it doesn't seem so huge? It's because the strength wasn't there, and we're just swayed. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a> has this strength in it, but it's a very pliable strength. It's like there's a softness to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>.

<span class="paragraph">So the <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> of form - the <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> of the form of sitting and walking - and then the <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> of just doing the practice. So returning, in our case now, to the phrases of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> when the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> wanders. And then sometimes it feels like I'm really staying with either a feeling of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, and can really let the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> stay with that for a while, or staying with the phrases. The <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>'s quite steady for a few moments, or seconds, or even minutes. And so, just that, the simplicity of that - this is how <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> begins.

<span class="paragraph">As the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> begins to settle through taking care in the basic ways that I've said so far, what we begin to see is that it's a completely non-linear process.

And not to expect it to be different. It's never a linear process. It's always got to have these waves to it.</span>

##### Learn to expect and accept hindrances

<span class="paragraph">One of the signs of maturing in practice is actually we've learnt, we're learning, to expect these waves. So the '<a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a>' - some of you are familiar with this word - the <a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a> to <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>. To really expect them and accept them. We can learn to see them out, okay? We can also learn to work with them, and this is really important, because it's not going to be this lovely, smooth ascent into the heavens of bliss. It's going to be pretty much a rough ride. [laughter] And pretty much you can expect every time there's a deepening, somehow, for some reason that I don't think anyone's really figured out yet, there tends to be a backlash. So you feel like, "Wow, that's opened to a new level!", and then all <a data-href="hell" class="internal-link">hell</a> breaks loose. Don't know why, but that's just the way the human <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> unfolds into depth, for some reason.</span>

<span class="paragraph">When it's rough, what we can begin to realize is this is just the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> doing the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>'s patterns. It's just the human <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> doing the human <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>'s patterns. We don't have to be taken for a ride with it, by it. So for example, I think <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Catherine McGee" data-href="Catherine McGee" class="internal-link">Catherine</a>'s going to talk about <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> tomorrow night. <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> is one of the <a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a>. When I sat down first to do <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, my very first <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> twenty years ago, "Great! Sounds like a great idea." Sat down, listened to the instructions, tried it. _Fuming_ with rage! [laughter] Coming out of my ears, it was! What's going on? <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> is what's going on, <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So to expect these things to be there. Now, sometimes they're very subtle, and sometimes they're quite strong. The difference, the important thing is, as we get maturity in the practice, we actually realize, "Oh, it's just <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>. It's not _actually_ that the person sitting next to me deserves to be kicked out of <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> or die or something." We tend to think that it's the situation that's a problem. And the maturity is, "Oh, it's just the human <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> with the seed of <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>," and that seed of <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> has come and made a little, usually ugly, plant of <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>. And that's just what it is. And to recognize it for what it is. We don't have to get so caught up in the content of what the <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> is saying, or what the greed is saying, or what the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a> is saying, or whatever it is, or the doubt.</span>

<span class="paragraph">This is a real sign of maturity: "Oh, it's just that. I don't have to be pulled into the story of it." This comes with practice. It comes with a maturity, and it's just, "Oh, okay, just the hindrance. Strap in!", you know. It's okay. It's really okay. Don't have to be sucked into the story. Also with maturity, we don't have to take it so personally: "Oh, doubt again. Oh, sleepiness again. Oh, greed again. I'm such a lousy meditator. I'm such a greedy person, such an angry person. If I were _da-da-da-da,_ then this wouldn't happen." It's the human <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>. In the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s words, it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>. It's not me, not mine, it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a>. It's not who I am. It's just the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> has these seeds. Human minds have these seeds, from the day you're born till the day you die, unless you're completely and utterly <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightened</a>. It has these seeds, and they're <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a>; it doesn't imply anything about ourselves.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So can we actually begin to see (and this is part of maturing in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>; this is part of the <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>), can we see it's just stuff? It's just human stuff. It doesn't say anything about me. I am a human. I have a <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>. This is what it's going to do. And can we actually begin to look at it that way? It's not me, it's not mine. Don't have to take it personally. Can we have some <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a> towards what's difficult in <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>?

<span class="paragraph">In the instructions, we're taking one object, which is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, and we're returning to that. So <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> in that sense, so far. In my <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, both for myself and teaching, it's very common for - quite soon, often - when people take an object, whether it's the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, for a sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a> to come in. And then, usually, if you're sitting an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a> <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, what happens is the instructions move quite quickly to opening out. And then there's a sense of, "Ahh," just being with everything, and not staying with an object like the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>. What happens for most people is that when they open out, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a> that they felt in trying to stay with one object goes away. And it's like, "Ahh! Lovely!" So the answer is, ditch the trying to meditate on one object, and just kind of relax and open out. And that has a certain benefit to it. But is it possible, actually, that we can find a way of working that doesn't feel tight, or doesn't feel uncomfortable, limited that way?</span>

<span class="paragraph">Usually, it's my <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> that people shy away from <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> for a number of reasons. One is this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a> that comes in, very normal. One is the whole notion of seeming to be striving or orienting towards a goal. Very understandable, and I'll go into these in more detail. And one is a question of, "If I'm staying with one thing and getting nice and calm, am I suppressing something else that needs to come up? Am I suppressing some <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a> that need to come up? Am I suppressing some part of my being that needs to come up?" That's a very intelligent and important question to ask, and it reflects a kind of integrity and honesty when people ask that question, that they really, you know, "Let's look at what's going on here. Am I hiding from something?"</span>

<span class="paragraph">So, to unpack these a little bit. How can we practise without this sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a> or work with this sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a>? <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a> actually has a kind of softness to it.

<span class="paragraph">One way, or one important factor, is actually that - well, we might say the <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a>, the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, has a bit more breadth to it. So as I say, it's not this totally microscopic thing. A bit more breadth to the <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a>, and an <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> as a whole: how the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> is feeling, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of the body</a> at any time. And the sense of the <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a> at any time. In other words, what's my emotional relationship with the practice right now? Is it tight? Is it disinterested? Is it <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a>? Is it striving? And we can actually feel that emotion, and feel it in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, because that will be reflected as a kind of <a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a> in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> if the <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> has a certain breadth to it and is aware of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>. This breadth is actually a very important factor. When we feel that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a>, can we actually just begin to relax it?

<span class="paragraph">There needs to be a growing, deepening sensitivity to the whole question of effort.

It's also very important for <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>. It's very important for <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> too.

And sometimes more of a _probing_ sense. And this balance, it's very connected with effort. When it's more relaxed, there's a less efforted space. Very important to play - important word: play - with this balance. This is something we need to explore for ourselves, and make it very personal, very alive, very meaningful for ourselves. We can actually do _this_ and do _this_, and see, "Ah, what's needed now? How does it feel? What are the effects?"</span>

##### We are giving metta to ourselves, but we are also receiving metta

<span class="paragraph">In <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice, this actually has other implications. Already now, we're giving the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> to ourselves. We're _giving_ the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> to ourselves, so we're giving, but we're also _receiving_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>. So sometimes in doing the practice, you can tune into the sense of what it is to feel that flow of giving, and sometimes tune into the flow, "I'm _receiving_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>. I'm _receiving_ that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">goodwill</a>." And what does it feel like to be in the receiving of it? Both are important. Some of us need practice, actually, at receiving <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, not only giving it. Sometimes we, for all different kinds of reasons, we put up barriers and defences to actually receiving <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. So sometimes it's good in the practice to really tune into that quality, and feel oneself receiving.</span>

##### The question of effort is connected with a sense of duality, which is connected with a sense of love

<span class="paragraph">If there's too much <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a>, it can actually cause the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> to spin off in thinking. It's like a banana that's peeled, and you're squeezing it, and it's like, it might shoot off out the end. Somehow, too much <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a> in practice actually causes more thought - _can_ do. Sometimes too much relaxation actually causes kind of sinking, which then just spins off into <a data-href="tiredness" class="internal-link">tiredness</a>. So this is something that's very delicate; this whole question of effort is very delicate. And it's very connected with <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> at a very deep level, actually. When there's effort, there's a sense of "me being somewhere and trying to get somewhere else." Now, there may be some <a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a> in that, but if we talk about a really boundless <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, a boundless <a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a>, there's a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">duality</a> there: this and that. I am here, and I want to be there. That <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">duality</a>, that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a>, at a very deep level, a very deep level of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, that's exactly what gets ended, that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">duality</a> - in _all_ things; not just between self and other, but between _things_. So this question of effort is connected, at a very deep level, with a sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">duality</a>, and a sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">duality</a> is very much connected with a sense of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>.</span>

People also shy away from the development of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> because, as I said, because it seems like a goal-oriented practice. But we have all kinds of goals in life, and maybe we actually _need_ goals in life. Some are very simple.

So this is actually something - to live in <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> is to live, is to dwell, in what is divine for a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a>. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a> is also a kind of dwelling.

In the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a> of that? Or oftentimes, you know, as humans, it's not; it's dwelling in what's really difficult. Actually, obsessing is a kind of dwelling. So some problem, some issue, something about ourselves that we don't like or are having trouble with, or in relationship, and the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> just goes round and round and round and round, and just sticks to that, and can't seem to disengage the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> from it.

You spend the night, and hopefully some relief, and then you wake up, and it just starts all over again. [laughter] But this is where we dwell a lot of the time. And so to deepen in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> is to actually learn - the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> learns to find a home, the heart learns to find a home, a dwelling, in a more lovely space.

<span class="paragraph">When we're doing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice, what we're actually doing is replacing all that mess of negative thought that's so often around, replacing that with actually thoughts that are skilful, that are helpful, that are calming and conducive to calm. It's actually difficult to have the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> phrases going and be really, _really_ involved in something else. I, some years ago, took on as a practice to do the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> phrases all day, no matter what I was doing, as much as possible - not if I was talking to someone, but just going down the street, or in the shower, or whatever it was. I think it was a few months I did it for, and to really take it on. At first, I noticed there was, "Oh, well, I'd rather be thinking about (whatever it was)", and then I sort of began to give a closer look to what it was that my <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> sort of spent its time thinking about. And generally, it wasn't particularly interesting. I don't know if your <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is anything like mine, but it was really not very interesting! [laughter] It was extremely uncreative. I can't even count how many times I had the same thoughts. Very unoriginal, not at all helpful generally. And so very shortly into this time of sort of ongoing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice, I just thought, "Actually, to have the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> phrases is just way nicer, way more helpful, just a much better thing to have, a much better inner environment."</span>

[laughter] It can sound great, but it's actually for many of us an acquired taste. We're really not used to it. We're not used to it.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And so in the practice, we can see: we get off onto some train of thought. In the formal practice, [there's] really no need to finish that thought. It's not going to make much difference whether you get to the end of that thought or not. Am I going to be happier for finishing that thought? Probably not. Am I going to be more miserable? Maybe!

<span class="paragraph">Similarly, you can notice if you're doing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">walking meditation</a>, you know, maybe you're in the walking room, and someone comes in: "Who is it?" The <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> wants to go. It's a natural tendency of the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>. Or you're outside and a car goes by: "What? Who?

<span class="paragraph">Okay. As this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness</a> begins to deepen in the being - probably not for everyone, but for some people at some time - there can arise what's called <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a> in Pali. That's usually translated as '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">rapture</a>.' And this goes back to what I was talking about, if there's a feeling of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a> in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, no matter how subtle or quiet it seems, how 'not so much of a big deal.' Sometimes this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>, this feeling in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, can be extremely strong, so strong that it's uncomfortably strong. The whole <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> starts shaking with it, and just really off-the-scale ecstasy. It's quite rare, but it certainly does happen. And there's a whole range.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So basically I'm just talking about - and again, not to grasp all this stuff, but just to introduce -there's a whole range of what's available in this word, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>, from just a very quiet sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasant feeling</a> in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> (and that may be located in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>; it may be throughout the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>), to really strong, overwhelming waves of ecstasy or bliss.

##### Centre the practice around the nice feeling which comes with metta

<span class="paragraph">Not to grasp at this, but just to know that this, when it comes - and again, this is not permanent; it can't stay forever, but if it comes and when it comes, to open to that as much as possible. Even if it's very quiet. And usually it _is_ very quiet. But just to really allow that in, and actually let the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> go there, and let the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> go into that. So in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice, it might be typical for a nice feeling to be in the heart area, centred around the heart area. And so, to really let that nice feeling be part of the practice. In a way, to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centre the practice</a> around that nice feeling, _in_ that nice feeling, in that <a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a>, in that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a>. To <a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a> it in it, and also to open the being to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a>. Sometimes the enjoyable feeling, as I say, it may be in the heart area, or maybe the face, in the head. Maybe it fills the whole <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, and we can sometimes _allow_ it to fill the whole <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Again, this is all part of the craft, the art, even, of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>. It's really an art, and it's a lifelong art. So please, not to grasp at any of this. It's part of the whole terrain, and sometimes it's a little strange to hear about things if we haven't experienced them, and we think, "Oh, I should have," or "When will I?" or "That's the only thing that's important" or something. But just to paint a bit more of a big picture. And to be okay with having a sense of where things may unfold. That's just the beginning, and really there are infinite depths of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>.

##### 1. Piti is a kind of energy

<span class="paragraph">So what allows this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>, this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">rapture</a>? What allows that? What encourages that? One of the ways, and the sort of most traditional way, is that the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is _with_ its object - either the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> or the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> or the phrases - and it's sort of, in one way of thinking about it, it's like rubbing, two sticks rubbing against. The <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is rubbing against the object, and the friction causes the sparks, and the sparks are the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasant feeling</a>. I think that's traditional - I hope I didn't make it up! [laughter] So that's the traditional way: the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, instead of being scattered, it begins, because of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness</a>, to actually gather <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>. When it's scattered, the <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> is being pulled. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">Pīti</a>, that <a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a>, that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">rapture</a>, is actually a kind of <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>. And so, with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness</a> there, the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> begins to gather <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> in a very organic, natural way. And then that <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> expresses itself as <a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Interest is very related to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>. When we're really interested in the <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>, interested in the feeling, interested in the phrases, that interest lends itself to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>. Sometimes the word <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a> is translated as 'interest.' So they're very related. And we can notice this even outside of <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>: when we're really into something, actually, if you check, there's a feeling of <a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a>. "Ahh," really interested. Usually it's very quiet outside of <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>, but there's that feeling of <a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a>.

<span class="paragraph">Openness of being. Openness of being is really very, very conducive to this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">rapture</a>.

Just that the <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> is open, the life is open, the <a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a> is open. This is why <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a> and everything that I talked about earlier is important.

<span class="paragraph">When we get down to it, it's actually a non-entanglement with things. That's the fundamental cause for arising of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>. When the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is not pushing, pulling, obsessing, grappling with things, then there can be that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>. And again, that has very much something to do with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, because <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> is a non-struggle. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Mettā</a> towards <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> is a non-struggle with <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>.

<span class="paragraph">So this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a> when it's there, it's very much to be encouraged. Very much to be encouraged this openness, this interest, this everything that allows <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>. For some people, for _many_ people, actually, when the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> begins to settle in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, or even also this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a> when it comes, it can actually bring <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>. It can be quite fearful. The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>, one of the five most prominent fears that the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> listed was <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> of unusual <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind state" data-href="Mind state" class="internal-link">mind states</a>. [laughs] It _is_ unusual. When the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> begins - we're just not used to it, the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> settling down. And so there can be some <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> in there. And just to know that's really okay. And if there's a breadth of <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, we can be, "Ah, the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is settling," I'm aware of that, and I'm also aware, as I said, of my emotion about the practice. Maybe it's <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>. Can I then, without <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a> the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, just very gently incline the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> towards the <a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a> of the depth? Just very gently. We don't need to push anything away. And so the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> gets slowly, slowly used to the new terrain.</span>

<span class="paragraph"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a>, as I said, has this quality of softness to it. One of the things that begins to soften with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> is the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of the body</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> softening. The boundaries of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> begin to soften, _can_ begin to soften. What can also begin to soften is the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a>. Usually we have a very fixed, rigid kind of sense: "I am _here_, I stop _here,_ and you begin _there,_ and this is _not_ me." The whole <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a>, or self-<a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, is quite fixed, rigid, and set.</span>

##### The softening of the sense of self can be an existential fear

<span class="paragraph">As the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> and also the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> deepens - both, both together - the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a> can begin to soften, can really begin to attenuate some more. There can be less of a sense of a 'doer,' a 'meditator.' And this, too, may bring up a lot of <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> at times. It can be a <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, an existential <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> of disappearing, similar to a <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> of <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a>. This is not at all uncommon. Some people don't get it at all, and then it's fine, not a problem. But some people do. But again, it's okay, and we can gradually work with this. It doesn't have to be a problem.</span>

##### Let go and open up to different ways of seeing the self

<span class="paragraph">What we learn is that our fixed views of self begin to lose their fixity. Instead of just one view of self that we have and we're stuck there, and this is where it is and it's rigid, we begin to let go of that and open up to different <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a> <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>. Who am I, if I'm not caught in some issue, caught in some views or thinking? Who am I when the thinking - if it calms down, am I still me? Am I the same me that I thought I was?</span>

##### Samadhi should have love in it
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^11-5" data-href="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice#^11-5" class="internal-link">11-5</a>**: _<a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (9) · <a data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">Nondualism</a> · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Nature" class="internal-link">Nature</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So when the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a> attenuates, this has a lot to do with the sense of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, because when there's too much of a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a> between self and other, that's perhaps the primary block to <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> flowing. <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a>, in a way, is that coming together, communion. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a>, anyway, should, I very strongly feel, it should have <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> in it. Somehow when the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> collects, calms, deepens like that, there should be a quality of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> in it: <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> for oneself, <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> for others, <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> for <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a>, <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> for all things.</span>

##### Receptivity and an openess to some kind of wonder in being

<span class="paragraph">There should also be this quality of <a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a> that I was talking about, just an openness to some kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Wonder" data-href="Wonder" class="internal-link">wonder in being</a>. Occasionally I've come across people where that isn't the case. Somehow the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is really, really, really settling down, getting very focused, getting very still, very deep, and there aren't those qualities of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, of <a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a>. A person is moving around, and there's no sense of openness to <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a>, a connection. There's no <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love" data-href="Love" class="internal-link">sense of connection</a> with the people practising around one. And what I've seen is that that doesn't really bear the fruit. It doesn't really bear the fruit. And in one case, there was someone practising for a long time in this way, without that <a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a> and <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. And then a situation changed, and there were quite some difficult health issues, very difficult health issues, understandably challenging. But the whole practice went out the window, completely. Not only in terms of as a resource, but actually as a practice. It just stopped. And I feel that for <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> to really go deep in a way that it's really making an impact deep in the being, there has to be that <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and <a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a> there.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So finally, I just want to touch on this question, the other reservation that sometimes people can have about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>. It's this question of "Am I suppressing? Am I suppressing emotion or some part of my being through collecting the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> that way?" So this is a very delicate question, actually. It's not to rush to too soon an answer, and assume that I _must_ be suppressing.</span>

##### Example story: because of samadhi there weren't the conditions there for anger

<span class="paragraph">I remember years ago, I had been in a certain kind of relationship with someone. It was actually a teaching relationship with someone, and they were _my_ teacher. It's a long story, but there was a lot of <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> there. I felt a lot of <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>. The relationship had ended, and there was a lot of <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>. And I went to practise one evening at a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">meditation centre</a>, and got quite calm. There was some <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> there, nothing particularly deep. The memory of this person came up, and the beginnings of <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>. And instead of going off into the whole big production of <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> and all the fullness of that, and all the story and everything, because of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, there was just a moment of <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> - no sense of repression - and it didn't actually go into anything else. Because of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, there was a clarity, and I actually saw: "Ah! This is something very significant." It's _not_ that - the assumption might be that "This is what's happening. We're angry, and the <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> is kind of living in me, in my heart, in my <a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a>, waiting to come out. I _need_ to express this." It was rather that, because of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, because of the settledness of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, there weren't the conditions there for that <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> to arise in the present - which is a very different <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>, and has huge implications about our emotional life as human beings. It has _huge_ implications.</span>

##### Exercise: if calmness is there, drop in the thought of a difficult issue
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^12-3" data-href="0122 Samadhi in Metta Practice#^12-3" class="internal-link">12-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">Steadiness</a> (3) · <a data-href="Anger" class="internal-link">Anger</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Similarly, there was a work retreatant here a while ago who was experiencing some <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a> and also some periods of real struggle with issues. I can't remember what it was, but it was a whole very involved thing. So I suggested, when the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a> is there, why don't you see if you can just drop in the thought of the issue? Just drop it into the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a> like a drop in the still water. And just see what happens. So she did that, went away and did that, and came back. Nothing happened. And she was so shocked almost by that. Why does nothing happen? Because the conditions aren't there. The <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>, the issue that we think lives whole, ready inside of us, needing to come up, the conditions aren't there in the moment for it to be there.</span>

<span class="paragraph">It's a very different <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>, very significant. So what that means is the issues that we - we have to be delicate with this; you can't make it a black or white thing. I just want to introduce the question, because sometimes things _are_ there, and they _do_ need to come up. But oftentimes the issues that we think are so real, so compelling and so needing to come up - they don't come up, because the conditions aren't there. And we see this with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>. They're, we say in <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> language, empty of inherent existence. They don't exist by themselves. We usually need to see this over and over. So probably, as I'm saying it, it doesn't sound that significant. But we see this over and over with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, and actually it's something very, very deeply significant.</span>

<span class="paragraph">We tend to think of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> as we're _creating_ something, we're _creating_ this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a>, we're _creating_ this nice state or whatever. Actually, when we really practise, and we really look at the question of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, you understand it's the opposite: we spend our lives creating things. We spend our lives creating a lot of problems, often, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, we're beginning to _stop_ creating things.

<span class="paragraph">So this question - I'm just touching on it briefly now - this question of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of things</a> and seeing that through the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice, seeing that through <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>, it's hugely significant. I mean, it's probably _the_ most significant thing in the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, actually. When we talk about <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a>, that's really what it is: it's <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a> to <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>, and what does that mean, and what's the effect on the being and the effect on the heart. So we'll be talking hopefully as the <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> goes on much more about this and the place of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> in discovering the meaning of that.</span>
