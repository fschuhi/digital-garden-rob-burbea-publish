## Paragraphs
[[Love and Emptiness -|plain list]]

##### We are cultivating metta and compassion, and we can see the blessings that come from that
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^1-1" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^1-1" class="internal-link">1-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">Blessing</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Okay, so I want to talk a bit about [[love]] and [[emptiness]], and pick up on what we introduced today in terms of practice. But first I think just a very brief sort of review of the show so far, sort of thing. And at this point, I don't think I need to sort of sell <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> any more to anyone - at least I hope not. But what are we doing here? We're cultivating <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> and [[compassion]]. And we can see, we can feel, here on the [[retreat]] and in our lives, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Blessing" data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">blessings</a> that come from that, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Blessing" data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">gifts</a> of doing that, for our selves, for our own lives, for our own being, and in the world, for others.</span>

---
##### In transforming the heart, we're transforming our intentions in life
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^1-2" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a> (2) · <a data-href="Reconditioning" class="internal-link">Reconditioning</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So one <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a> at what's going on - it's a very helpful way, a very real <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a> at what's going on - is that we're [[reconditioning]] the [[mind]] and the heart. That's not a very appealing word maybe, '[[reconditioning]].' But we're transforming, we're cultivating qualities of the [[mind]] and the heart. We are planting seeds of intention, of [[love]] and [[compassion]], and they bear fruit in their time. They bear fruit. And in transforming the heart, we're transforming our intentions in life. So that gradually, slowly, in a very non-linear way, over time, the way we act in the world, the choices that we make, what we put out into the world, is transformed, is reconditioned. The way we speak, the words we use, what we say, what we don't say, is transformed. And our thoughts and our intentions in life are transformed. And that's a very powerful thing, not to be underestimated. So that's one very important part of what's going on.</span>

##### Through metta and compassion we are creating an ideal inner climate for growth
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^1-3" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (3) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Another part in the sort of big picture of our lives and our practice, what we're also doing is, through the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, through the [[compassion]], creating a kind of ideal inner climate for growth. I know for myself there have been periods of time when I've been really trying very hard to grow, to understand myself, to understand life - but there wasn't that climate of [[love]] for oneself, wasn't a lot of climate of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>. And it was like banging my head against a wall, really. The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, the [[compassion]], are ideal, the ideal soil.</span>

---
##### In practice, wholesome nourishment and investigation support each other
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^1-4" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">Kusala</a> (3) · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> (4) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Third thing: the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>, in his way of teaching, he actually didn't teach too much about technique, and [[meditation]] technique and that sort of - maybe he did, and it hasn't really been recorded. But what he did, one thing that he emphasized over and over and over again, was a sort of approach to practice which was twofold. One part is a kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a>. So <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a> the heart, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a> the [[mind]], the [[consciousness]], the being, in the most <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> way possible. And that's one half of the practice. And the other half is investigation, [[insight]], looking into life, looking deeply and learning. And these two - <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a> and investigation, [[insight]] - support each other and they feed each other. And as an overall principle of what practice is about, that's a very good working model.</span>

---
##### We are cultivating qualities of mind and heart, but there's no self in it
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^1-5" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^1-5" class="internal-link">1-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> (2) · <a data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">Kusala</a> (2) · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Activism" class="internal-link">Activism</a> · <a data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anatta</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So again, through the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, through the [[compassion]], we're finding ways in our lives and in [[meditation]] of really <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a> ourselves very deeply in a very <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> way - what the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> would call '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> abiding' or 'skilful abiding,' to abide in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, to abide in [[compassion]]. And again, it's just important to mention (I've probably already said it, but): none of this is really about self-improvement, about me wanting to be a better person because I'm not good enough yet. That's not where it's coming from. We are re-cultivating qualities of [[mind]] and heart, and one can be fully committed to that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Activism" data-href="Activism" class="internal-link">engagement</a>, fully committed to that transformation of the qualities of heart, fully committed to that, but there's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">no self</a> in it. There's no measurement or comparing or "I should be better than I am." It's just gone. It's just not there as a potent force, and certainly not as a potent force for <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. But the commitment to the [[cultivation]] is still there.</span>

---
##### The mind is conditions - there's nothing wrong with reconditioning it
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^2-1" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Reconditioning" class="internal-link">Reconditioning</a> (5) · <a data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">Kusala</a> · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (5) · <a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a> (2) · <a data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Awakening</a> · <a data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">Habit</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12293/20070204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_emptiness-12293.mp3#t=05:42" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So there's this, whatever we want to call it, transformation, [[reconditioning]]. There's the climate for growth. There's the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a> to balance with the [[insight]]. Some time ago, I think it was about a year ago, I was teaching a one-day [[retreat]], and I was teaching it on [[compassion]]. And in the question and answer period, a man asked a question: "Well, okay, that's all very nice, but aren't you just [[reconditioning]] the [[mind]]? Aren't you just [[reconditioning]]? How will you penetrate through to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a> if all you're doing is recreating the conditions?" So I _think_ he was coming from an earnest place, and it's a good question - <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a> being another word for the goal of practice, of nibbāna, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">liberation</a>. And I can't remember exactly what I said to him, but we _are_ at one level, as I said, [[reconditioning]] the [[mind]]. There's nothing wrong with that. The [[mind]] _is_ conditions. The [[mind]] has these <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a> and grooves. And it can have a groove of irritability, a groove of judgment, a groove of self-criticism, and they're really deep, and they've been deepened over decades. And one thing that we're doing is [[reconditioning]] the [[mind]]. And there's every validity in that, if we're interested in a life that's more open, more peaceful, more happy.</span>

---
##### There is cultivation, but also that we're actually getting out of the way
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^2-2" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> (2) · <a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a> (3) · <a data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">Letting go</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (3) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3) · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">But then the Buddha also talks about the "conditioning that leads to the end of conditions." And this is quite important. Some cultivations and conditions actually do not just lead to more conditions - they lead to what the Buddha would call 'unbinding,' a letting go of conditions. So mettā, compassion, samādhi are three such cultivations, three such conditionings of the mind that actually move (over time, and slowly) toward the Unconditioned. So, I think I've already said this, but we can feel like we're here doing this practice, and we're sort of grinding away at the phrases and the mettā, and we're building loving-kindness and we're building compassion, and it's this fragile sort of structure that we're hoping to hold in place. But sometimes, a different sense of it is visible, which is that we're actually getting out of the way. We're doing less and less. And in that doing less and less, we are building less and less, building less and less barriers. And there's the love there. There's the compassion. And in a way, this process just goes deeper and deeper until what we would call the Unconditioned becomes 'visible,' if that's the word for it.</span>

##### The walls that we usually feel in place begin to just dissolve a little bit.
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^2-3" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Oneness" class="internal-link">Oneness</a> · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> (2) · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">And then, as we've also talked over the time, through dedicated practice to [[love]] and [[compassion]], there is, at times, possible, a sense of the separate self kind of dissolving a little bit to some extent. The boundaries, the barriers, the walls that we usually feel in place begin to just dissolve a little bit. And comes to some degree, into the practice, for a short period of time or a long period or whatever, a sense of [[oneness]] - that this sense of me and you, self and other, self and the world that we so take for granted, it just dissolves a little bit, and we have a different sense of life, a different [[perception]] of the reality of things. That can come, and it will go. It's a [[perception]] that can arise and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a>.</span>

---
##### Cultivating love and compassion eases the view of self, which leads to an easing of the sense of separation
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^2-4" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^2-4" class="internal-link">2-4</a>**: _<a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> (2) · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (2) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">Nondualism</a> · <a data-href="Oneness" class="internal-link">Oneness</a> · <a data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anatta</a> · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Through the practice, the walls of [[the self]] can begin to soften. In a way, we could say self and ego and all that is built by a kind of problematic <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a>, a view of struggling with oneself, in a way. And to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a> [[love]] and [[compassion]] is actually easing the view of self. And in that there is an easing of the sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a>. So there's [[oneness]], and also as we've touched on over the weeks, the possibilities of getting a sense or glimpses of this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>, this [[emptiness]] of self, through the practice, just through the practice of [[love]] and [[compassion]].</span>

##### So far, metta was directed to beings
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^3-1" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^3-1" class="internal-link">3-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (4) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12293/20070204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_emptiness-12293.mp3#t=10:38" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Okay, that's a sort of brief bus tour, like I said, of the show so far. This morning we began something different. So everything so far, the first two weeks, has been <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and [[compassion]] towards _beings_, which is of course how we tend to conceive of it: <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> towards self, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> towards others and all beings. And extending the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> in that very boundless and universal way.</span>

##### "Seeing all things with compassion"

<span class="paragraph">I remember when I was living in America, and there was an urban centre there. I think twice a year they would publish their brochure, programme. And it would have the list of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a> and all that stuff in it. And for about five years or something, every time, every edition that came out had on the front of it this nice picture of a <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> statue smiling or something, and this quote from the <a data-href="Lotus Sutra" class="internal-link">Lotus Sutra</a>, which is one of the very well-known and well-loved <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sutra" data-href="Sutra" class="internal-link">sūtras</a>. And this quote said, "See all things with the eyes of [[compassion]]," or "See all things through the eyes of [[compassion]]." And so for five years I saw that on the front and said, "Very nice, okay," and went and saw who were the teachers that were coming, what <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a> can I do, etc. And at some point, it dawned on me, "Well, actually it doesn't say, 'See all _beings_ with [[compassion]].' It says 'See all _things_ with [[compassion]],' which is a different thing." So we begin to [[wonder]], what does that mean? Does it mean regard the alarm clock with [[compassion]]? What does it mean?</span>

<span class="paragraph">> At the beginning of the spiritual life, [[love]] is directed towards beings.

<span class="paragraph">In a way, we began this this morning: directing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, directing the [[compassion]], towards [[experience]], towards objects of [[experience]], rather than beings. And just to review - we did the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditation</a> this morning, but just to review. Whatever way of working with that is helpful to you, is fine. So it could be something's happening in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> or the heart or the [[mind]] or whatever, and there's a sense of bathing it, bathing it in [[love]] and [[compassion]], directing the flow, the current of [[love]] and [[compassion]] towards that. May be more helpful to kind of feel or envisage a kind of _holding_ of the [[experience]], of the object, in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, in [[love]] or [[compassion]].</span>

##### Emphasis was on complete acceptance
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^3-7" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^3-7" class="internal-link">3-7</a>**: _<a data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahayana</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (2) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> (3) · <a data-href="Acceptance" class="internal-link">Acceptance</a> (3)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Should also say at this point, in a lot of the Mahāyāna teachings, they dispense at one level with the words 'love' and 'compassion.' They just use one word, 'compassion,' to mean mettā and compassion. So this morning in the guided meditation, I was actually going back and forth between using those words, and just to - not to confuse anyone. And you can use the phrases if that's helpful, you know. Again, we can go into this sense of consciousness, just awareness, the space of awareness just being a very open door. And there's _complete_ welcoming, _complete_ acceptance. So what's being emphasized here is the love, the acceptance. Absolute, radical acceptance. Not, as in a usual vipassanā practice or awareness practice, the precision, the clarity: "What exactly is going on? Can I see it moment to moment to moment?"</span>

##### With mindfulness practice, there's both emphasis on precision and acceptence, here: more the welcoming of the experience
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^4-1" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^4-1" class="internal-link">4-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Acceptance" class="internal-link">Acceptance</a> (2) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> (2) · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">If we talk about [[mindfulness]] practice, both those emphases are there - there's the emphasis on precision and [[acceptance]]; oftentimes it's the precision that we tend to emphasize. So there's a reversal of that here. I'm not so interested in the precision, but we're really interested in the flow of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>, in the holding, in the [[acceptance]], in the welcoming. Really emphasizing as complete as possible, a genuine welcoming of the [[experience]], of the moment's [[experience]] of the object in [[consciousness]], for its arising, for its staying, for its passing.</span>

##### Relaxing back into a space of metta
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^4-2" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^4-2" class="internal-link">4-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (3) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (5) · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> · <a data-href="Acceptance" class="internal-link">Acceptance</a> (2) · <a data-href="Ram Dass" class="internal-link">Ram Dass</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">And we can, as I say, we can direct the mettā, the compassion, towards the object. Or, in a way, you can kind of feel like you're relaxing back into a space, a space of mettā, a space of compassion, a space that's imbued with love. And without forcing, the objects of consciousness, whatever arises, is arising in that space. So sometimes in this practice, it will feel like, "Well, I can't feel any love. There's just a sense of resistance" or whatever. But to remember: there can be a sense that there's nowhere outside of acceptance. There's nowhere outside of love. So if we feel resistance, if we feel non-acceptance, if we feel judging, if we feel numb - whatever it is, the love, the space of love, can just be bigger, bigger than that, and see that, too, and embrace that, too, and bathe that, too, in the kindness, in the complete welcoming. And this welcoming has to be, this total welcoming has to be as genuine as possible. So as Ram Dass says, if you're trying to accept something in order that it goes away, it has a way of knowing. [laughter] It knows, he says. So just to check that out. But if there is resistance, that too. Can take a step back and that, too, is included.</span>

##### The fleeting nature of experience deserves our compassion

<span class="paragraph">So at first, if you're just hearing this, it might sound a little odd, but hopefully today you've had a little bit of a sense of this practice. It can be also we are opening up to the flow of [[experience]] inside, and we're just seeing [[experience]] coming and going, and coming and going. In a way, the very fleeting [[nature]] of [[experience]], in a way it deserves our [[compassion]]. <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> is almost nothing. It's poor. It's impoverished, in a way, and it needs our [[compassion]]. You could see it that way.</span>

##### Experience begin to fade

<span class="paragraph">So a question about this practice. Maybe I can even ask you now: what happens to [[feelings]] when they're there and we really bathe them or hold them in [[love]]? What happens to mental states? What happens to [[emotions]], to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a>, to our <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a> of things? So this really is a practice. It's very much a practice as much as [[mindfulness]] is a practice. But you may notice and you may have noticed today - I don't know, but you may have noticed today - that there's a way that things can kind of soften. That there's an [[experience]], there's a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> sensation or an emotion, and it just begins to soften. Its edges may begin to blur, begin to dissolve a little bit. It loses its definition. It may even begin to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a> somewhat. Did anyone notice anything like that at all today? Okay, some people. Good. [laughter] Phew! Otherwise we'd be straight back into [inaudible].</span>

##### The practice is not about being in the present moment, but rather feeding what's beautiful and investigation
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^4-5" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^4-5" class="internal-link">4-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">Phenomenon</a> · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> · <a data-href="Present moment" class="internal-link">Present moment</a> · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">Kusala</a> (2) · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> · <a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Okay, what's going on here? What is going on here? This is very curious. This is a very curious [[phenomenon]]. We could say, "What has this got to do with - I thought Buddhist practice and [[mindfulness]] and vipassanā, I thought all that was about being with things as they are, and being in the moment, and being with what is and all that. And here I am doing this practice, and everything is kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a> or dissolving or losing its definition. That can't be right!" So again, to go back to something I said before, what practice is about is actually not about being with what is. It's not about being with things as they are or being in the [[present moment]]. That's not what it's about. It's about - what the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> keeps emphasizing - this balance of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a>, feeding what's beautiful, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> abiding, and investigation. The investigation, investigating into what brings [[freedom]] - which may, at times, take the form of "I'm just being with what is, what seems there in the moment." That's one avenue. But that can never be the main point of practice. The main point of practice is moving towards [[freedom]], which is actually something different.</span>

##### How we approach freedom doesn't matter - different approaches at different times
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^5-1" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^5-1" class="internal-link">5-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a> · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">How we move to that [[freedom]], whether it's through [[mindfulness]] or vipassanā or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, it's actually completely irrelevant and it doesn't matter at all. Different approaches, different times. Some people lean towards one or the other, but maybe one could say that knowing all approaches actually gives a fuller <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>, I don't know. But certainly different approaches at different times.</span>

##### With insight meditation there is the assumption that mindfulness is neutral
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^5-2" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^5-2" class="internal-link">5-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> (4) · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Emotions" class="internal-link">Emotions</a> · <a data-href="Mind state" class="internal-link">Mind state</a> · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> (3) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Anger" class="internal-link">Anger</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Heaven" class="internal-link">Heaven</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So with [[mindfulness]] practice, that we're, I think, more familiar with - vipassanā and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a> - there's an assumption there, that actually teachers are to blame for, which is that [[mindfulness]] is neutral. There's something called [[mindfulness]]. There are objects in the world - sights, and sounds, and smells, and tastes, and touches, and thoughts, and [[emotions]], and all that stuff - and then there's something called [[mindfulness]] which is there, and it sees it as it is. It sees things as they are in a way that's very neutral, very not involved, not active, not influencing. But is that really true? Is there really such a thing? So to think about outside our practice, we can see how much the [[mind state]] that we have at any time influences our [[perception]]. We have this phrase, "seeing red," when we're really angry. Completely consumed in rage, and we say "seeing red." Actually, the very language is pointing to this [[insight]]: that our whole [[perception]] is coloured through the [[anger]]. Or as I'm sure you've noticed at least a little bit at times on this [[retreat]], sometimes there's just a feeling of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> there, and then what kind of world do we live in, what kind of world do we inhabit? Sometimes it's so strong it's a [[heaven]] realm, it's so much changed the [[perception]].</span>

##### But the mind is coloroud with anger, metta, romantic love
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^5-3" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^5-3" class="internal-link">5-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Anger" class="internal-link">Anger</a> (3) · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> (3) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (7) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (3) · <a data-href="Romantic love" class="internal-link">Romantic love</a> · <a data-href="Mind state" class="internal-link">Mind state</a> · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So anger colours the perception, mettā colours the perception. Sometimes when we're angry with someone else, we immediately rush to think, "I need to give mettā to this other person to sort of remedy the anger." Sometimes it's very interesting to actually give mettā to ourselves when we're angry with someone else. After all, we're probably feeling hurt, so we might need it. But it's quite interesting then, because when the mettā to ourself begins to kick in, we can actually notice: there may be a change of perception of the person, of the situation. Why? Because the mind is then coloured with mettā. So anger colours it, mettā colours it, certainly romantic love colours it. Mind always has some mind state. So with mindfulness, there's always _some_ degree of something on the range from complete unconditioned bliss of loving-kindness to rage. The mind will be somewhere along that spectrum. It _has_ to be.</span>

So there's a spectrum, and the [[mind]] is always somewhere on that spectrum. Which amount of [[love]] reveals the real object, reveals the way it really is? Anyone? [laughter] Who's going to say? There's always some degree there. Which amount reveals the real object? And we're noticing, in the practice, "Well, when there's a lot of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> there, the object changes." It changes its form, its impression. What's the real object? What's this real world that we're referring to? What's this real moment, this real 'things as they are,' this real 'what is'? Is what is, what is? That's a question I want to ask. [laughter] Is what is, what is?</span>

<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^6-1" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^6-1" class="internal-link">6-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> (6) · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (2) · <a data-href="Emotions" class="internal-link">Emotions</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12293/20070204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_emptiness-12293.mp3#t=27:14" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So we say, "All right, maybe not [[mindfulness]]. What about that other word, '[[equanimity]]'? I've heard about that one. That must be the thing that's right there in the middle, at the perfect point. It even sounds like it, _equa_-, equa-something." But again, a deep practice of [[equanimity]], notice the same thing: the [[perception]] of the object begins to change. It changes with the degree of [[equanimity]]. And there's a similar kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a> with [[equanimity]]. Things make less impression on [[consciousness]] when there's a lot of [[love]] or a lot of [[equanimity]]. So we can definitely see this on the cushion and with this practice that we're doing now. You can see it with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a>, with painful <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a>, with [[emotions]], with whatever, absolutely. See it on the cushion in a very clear way. Can also see it off the cushion. This applies to our life too. Some situations where they're so pressing or we just can't stop thinking about them, when there's a lot of [[equanimity]], a lot of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, I barely register, barely register the situation, or the importance of it anyway.</span>

##### ..."Kindfulness" is a skilful means for ease in the moment
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^6-2" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^6-2" class="internal-link">6-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> (2) · <a data-href="Present moment" class="internal-link">Present moment</a> · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Okay, so, about this practice, someone last year - I actually didn't have a name for it, and someone last year coined the name 'kindfulness,' which is quite nice. [laughter] It might be a little too cute for you; I don't know. It's a shorthand anyway. So what about it? A couple of things. One thing is it's skilful means. It's a real skilful means for ease, for ease in the present. And the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> was hugely interested in this, for people to find ways of relating to the [[present moment]], find ways of abiding, and even abiding with what is difficult, or what feels difficult, with ways that are easeful, with a sense of ease. So it's what the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> would call a 'skilful means' for ease in the moment. It's really important in our life, really important to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a> this practice so that there is that skill in means, able to abide skilfully with a sense of ease. So there's that.</span>

##### Our relationship with experience is on a spectrum between peace or struggle
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^6-3" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^6-3" class="internal-link">6-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (2) · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">But there are enormous <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a> here. Enormous <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a>. So the first one, at one level, is that it's the relationship with things, it's the relationship with [[experience]], that is important. So oftentimes, and sometimes in [[mindfulness]] practice, sometimes we can be so much attending to the object - to the sensation or the [[breath]] or this or that or whatever - so much kind of caught up in the [[attention]] to the object that we forget, or we don't actually realize, what the relationship is. So basically - I mean, to put it very crudely - our relationship with [[experience]] is either peace or struggle, some degree of peace or some degree of struggle. Basically, that's it, in <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> terms. We have a relationship of either peace with something or struggle.</span>

##### A thing cannot be experienced as a problem unless I am in an unskilful relationship to it
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^6-4" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^6-4" class="internal-link">6-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> (3) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">A relationship of [[love]], of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, of [[compassion]] with [[experience]] is a relationship of peace. It's a relationship of peace with what's going on. And we begin to see that when the relationship is skilful, is one of ease, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> goes out of the thing. So it can be what it is, it can be unpleasant, it can be difficult, whatever, but the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> has gone out. So that's _hugely_ significant, to really, really know this, that some [[experience]], some thing does not inherently have any problem to it. Problems are empty, we say in <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> language, so a thing cannot be a problem, cannot be experienced as a problem unless I am in an unskilful relationship to it: I'm struggling with it, I'm pushing it, I'm pulling at it, whatever. And to see that: the thing, the [[experience]], the object, etc., inner or outer, is not the problem, cannot be a problem by itself. It's empty of problem. Problem is empty. Huge, huge [[insight]] there.</span>

##### Even oneness is not how things really are, it's also dependend on conditions
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^7-1" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^7-1" class="internal-link">7-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Oneness" class="internal-link">Oneness</a> (4) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Second one, and actually even deeper, is, again, this [[emptiness]] of how things are. Even, sometimes - going back to what I said before - sometimes in the practice there are openings or there's a kind of melting going on. There's a sense of [[oneness]]. And it can feel relatively nondescript or whatever, but that's rare. Or it can feel completely mystically, cosmically [[mind]]-blowing. And again, anywhere on that scale. There's a sense of [[oneness]]. But actually, what this [[insight]] into [[emptiness]] is saying is that even [[oneness]] is not how things are. That's a [[perception]]. If you remember that note that I read out from the work retreatant about a sort of sense of dark, infinite space of [[love]] that was kind of holding everything and accommodating everything that she opened up to - even that sense, beautiful, cosmic sense of infinite, eternal [[love]] that's, whatever you want to say, woven into the fabric of the universe - that arises when the conditions are there. When the conditions are not there, it won't be there. Same with the [[oneness]].</span>

##### But don't be in a hurry, as the power of those kinds of perceptions transforms heart and mind
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^7-2" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^7-2" class="internal-link">7-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> · <a data-href="Oneness" class="internal-link">Oneness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (2) · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> (4) · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">Fabrication</a> · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> · <a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph"><a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> of how things are. They're not separate. They're not one. They're not however. But I feel it's really, really important to say here: sometimes, often I think, what we hear in teachings is, "Don't get attached to a sense of [[oneness]]. Don't get attached to that sense of vast [[love]] holding everything, if that opens up, because that's just a [[perception]]. It just arises from conditions." And then we say, "Okay, I'll let go of that, whatever." Don't be in a hurry. If this is part of the [[experience]], really not to be in a hurry to let go of that kind of thing. The power of those kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a> to transform the heart and transform the [[mind]] over time is enormous, absolutely enormous. And if we hurry through, and just say, "Oh, just a [[perception]]. It's just conditions, just a [[fabrication]]," where do we go? We actually just go straight back to the default [[perception]], which is "I'm sitting here giving a talk, and you're trying to stay awake" or whatever it is. [laughter] That's the default. ==Human [[consciousness]] is programmed incredibly strongly to go to that default mode. What we begin to see in practice is that default <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of seeing</a> is not the reality. If we throw out what I would call the deeper senses of [[oneness]], of an infinite [[love]], whatever you want to call it, if we throw that out too quickly, we just go back to the default, and in a way, we're not challenging that default mode enough.==</span>

##### ..."By not holding to fixed views" - the liberation comes through how ways of seeing are fabricated
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^7-3" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^7-3" class="internal-link">7-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta Sutta" class="internal-link">Metta Sutta</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Awakening</a> (3) · <a data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">Nondualism</a> · <a data-href="Oneness" class="internal-link">Oneness</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> · <a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a> · <a data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">Fabrication</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12293/20070204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_emptiness-12293.mp3#t=35:27" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So there's a line. I don't know; it's curious. I'm not sure how many people even notice this - maybe people do, but - this is the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta Sutta" data-href="Metta Sutta" class="internal-link">Mettā Sutta</a>, and towards the end, it basically is a description of how <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> leads to complete [[awakening]]. And so, in the very last paragraph, "By not holding to fixed views," etc., "reaches <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightenment</a>."^[SN 1:8] [laughter] But that line, "By not holding to fixed views," not holding to the fixed view of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a>, the default everyday view, our normal view, which six and a half billion people agree to. Not holding to that view. Not also holding to the view of [[oneness]]. Not holding to the view of infinite space of [[love]]. And there are other views too. This is the power of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice, that one goes in and out - at a very deep level, if one gives months and months and months to this practice - one _will_ go in and out of various states of [[consciousness]], and then one just says, "Well, which one is real?" "By not holding to fixed views" - the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">liberation</a> comes through <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> something about how <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a>, views, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a>, are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a>.</span>

##### The Middle Way points to neither existence, nor non-existence, nor some kind of compromise
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^7-4" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^7-4" class="internal-link">7-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> · <a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So truth, in a way, all we can say is that the truth of things is that they're empty. To say they exist is a little - you know, when we begin practising this way, it's actually a little bit problematic. To say they don't exist at all is also problematic. So the truth of [[emptiness]] is actually something - it's called the <a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a>, meaning it's not existence and it's not non-existence, and nor is it some kind of compromise ("Well, they sort of, half the time they …" whatever). It's something that's a different kind of level: neither existence nor non-existence.</span>

##### Seeing into emptiness is seeing into freedom
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^8-1" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^8-1" class="internal-link">8-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So to begin - and that's what we're doing; we're just beginning this, because it's extremely deep and it's really, I'd say, it's a lifetime's journey, this questioning, this looking. To begin to see into the relationship and the influence of the relationship is to begin to see into [[emptiness]]. And to begin to see into [[emptiness]] is to begin to see into [[freedom]]. So this is what we're beginning.</span>

##### Example: "What I want" colouring the meditation practice
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^8-2" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^8-2" class="internal-link">8-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a> · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">We can see it in our practice, and we can see it on all kinds of levels. So we can also see it outside our practice. Or one might come to a situation like this, and here we are. You think, "Three weeks at <a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a>, right. I'm really going to get my <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> together. I'm going to really quieten the [[mind]]" or whatever. And then one comes, and someone's fidgeting next to you or whatever, or coughing or whatever it is, and you say, "How am I supposed to …?!" You know, I've arrived at the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">meditation centre</a> with this view - again, I've said it in another talk - of _what I want_. And then that begins to colour everything. We view the situation through _what I want_. So we can play with this. What happens if I come into the [[meditation]] hall, and here are all these, you know, irritating people again [laughs], or one particular person, and one says, "This person is giving me the opportunity to practise patience, to practise <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>," whatever? And see if one can actually genuinely make that shift, and see the situation differently. And then it's a gift, their presence and whatever it is they're doing.</span>

##### Changing the perception can make the irritability go away from the situation
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^8-3" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^8-3" class="internal-link">8-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (2) · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">And if you're kind of really adventurous and bold, you can come in and sit down and have a view, "Actually, I'm not here for <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>. All I'm here to do is to [[love]] you. That's all. I'm just here to [[love]] you." That's very advanced practice! [laughter] ==So what we notice is, if we change the view, the [[perception]] changes. The irritability goes from the situation. How we see the situation and how we see a person depends on what the [[mind]] is bringing to it - <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, [[compassion]], irritability, what I want, whatever it is. And the [[mind]]'s always bringing something.==</span>

##### Fear is not existing independently, but also dependend on the reaction to it
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^8-4" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^8-4" class="internal-link">8-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (7) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Anger" class="internal-link">Anger</a> · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12293/20070204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_emptiness-12293.mp3#t=40:29" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Okay, we're going to look at this from a different angle. To go back to - I was talking about last week or whenever it was - about [[fear]]. When there's [[fear]] in the [[mind]], we tend to think, "Here's a thing, an event, or a situation that I'm fearful of. And there's the thing and the event, and then there's my [[fear]]." And we tend to view them as separate: the thing, the event, the situation, and the [[fear]]. They're separate. Independent, existing independent. And we can see that in any way - there's any kind of object, and the reaction to it. But we can really see - [[fear]]'s good because it's quite clear, like [[anger]] - the [[fear]] colours our [[perception]] of the object. So we begin to see, you know, an ogre in the shadows when there's nothing there. There's nothing. In a way, that's obvious: [[fear]] colours the [[perception]] of the object. But we also need reminding of that.</span>

---
##### If I believe in the present as something real, independent of the mind, there will be fear of the future
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^8-5" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^8-5" class="internal-link">8-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (4) · <a data-href="Present moment" class="internal-link">Present moment</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2) · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">I think I also said when I was talking about [[fear]], [[fear]] is almost always about future, caught up with future thoughts. If I believe in a present, in the [[present moment]] that somehow exists in a real, independent way, that has its own inherent existence, independent of what the [[mind]] and the heart is bringing to it - if I believe in the present, in a 'what is,' in a 'here and now' that's like that - if I believe in this present thing having some independent existence, then to borrow an analogy of the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s, "as sure as the wheels of the cart follow the ox that pulls it," there will be [[fear]] of the future. If I believe in the present being something real, independent of the [[mind]], there will be [[fear]] of the future, because I'm believing in a present.</span>

---
##### Past, present and future are empty
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^9-1" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^9-1" class="internal-link">9-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Mind state" class="internal-link">Mind state</a> (2) · <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So can we again see: present is empty, because it depends on the [[mind state]]. It depends on what's there with the seeing. Past is empty. When we look back on the past, you look back at past romances or whatever, and sometimes it's, "Oh, that was nice. She was a really special one." [laughter] And other times, you look back and you think, "_Pfff,_" y_ou_ know. Or on our education. If I think back on my time in school, sometimes it seems, "God, that was really pressured and there was a lot of cruelty around." And other times, "God, I really had a laugh, you know." Or whatever. ==The past is coloured by the present [[mind]] state.== What's the real past? What's the independently existing past? Present is empty. Past is empty. Future is the same. Apart from not actually _existing_ - where is it? - when it becomes present, it will become present, and it will be empty. ==If I don't really believe in the present, I can't really believe in the future, and I can't really believe in [[fear]]. I can't really believe in the power of that.==</span>

##### "Compassion without any object of reference" in the traditions
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^9-2" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^9-2" class="internal-link">9-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Aksayamati Sutra" class="internal-link">Aksayamati Sutra</a> · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (4) · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> · <a data-href="Rumi" class="internal-link">Rumi</a> · <a data-href="Tibetan Buddhism" class="internal-link">Tibetan Buddhism</a> · <a data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahayana</a> · <a data-href="Vajrayana" class="internal-link">Vajrayana</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So going back to this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aksayamati Sutra" data-href="Aksayamati Sutra" class="internal-link">Akṣayamati Sūtra</a>: "For those who are further advanced on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>, [[love]] is based on dharmas." So this is now what we're doing. "For those who have seen into [[emptiness]], [[love]] is not based on anything." I just want to touch very briefly on this. This appears in other texts and traditions. So <a data-href="Rumi" class="internal-link">Rumi</a>, the Sufi mystical poet, has a poem. I can't remember the poem. "<a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> without an object," and something he says, "is the best kind of [[love]]." And in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tibetan Buddhism" data-href="Tibetan Buddhism" class="internal-link">Tibetan traditions</a>, the Tibetan <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a> traditions and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vajrayana" data-href="Vajrayana" class="internal-link">Vajrayāna</a> traditions, talk about “[[compassion]] without any object of reference.” And they talk about this being the very best of all paths, without any danger points. No danger of being disconnected and indifferent towards beings or anything like that.</span>

##### (Do we close down when we feel something is beyond us?)
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^9-3" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^9-3" class="internal-link">9-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (2) · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">And so I just want, very briefly - what does this mean, [[love]] without an object? So it's actually gone beyond the sense even of [[love]] to all things, to all beings, to all objects. It's actually something on a whole different level. And it comes, glimpses of it come or whatever, when there's very deep opening to [[emptiness]]. Or can come then. But I just wanted to mention that as a possibility, and just to drop in - I think maybe it's too late now on the [[retreat]], but it's sometimes interesting, I think, to notice the reaction when someone is talking or you read or whatever and it seems, "Oh, I'm really not there yet. I don't know what that is. That's way beyond me." Just to notice the reaction. Do we close down? Do we turn off? Do we immediately grasp at that and decide, "Well, my experiences I'm not interested in at all. I want _that_"? Or do we think, "Oh, I'm a complete failure"? Just to notice what goes on.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> talks about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">taṇhā</a>, [[craving]] that leads to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>; <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a> at things in a way that leads to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. And _[[chanda]]_, which is more like 'aspiration' or 'will to do': "That's something beautiful. I would like to know that. I would like to understand that. I would like to open to that." And so to have a healthy and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Chanda" data-href="Chanda" class="internal-link">noble aspiration</a> - and I think going back to the opening talk, I was talking about that - really important. Really lovely thing. ==So, you know, the analogy of, there's the mountain, and there's the peak of the mountain, and that's where we're headed, but the step is right here, right now. And we can see where we're going, and pay [[attention]] to where we are right now. And it's both. It's finding a sensitive balance of that.==</span>

##### When there's no clinging and grasping, wee feel the suffering go out of experience

<span class="paragraph">Okay, so what about this business of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a>? Sometimes we bathe something in [[love]] or hold it in [[love]], or there's really a lot of [[love]] there, and then the object begins to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a>. What is going on here? Why is that? We can begin to see maybe, or get a sense, that [[love]], in a way, has a whole range to it. And in its depths, [[love]], in a way, like [[equanimity]], is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a>. It has the quality of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">non-clinging</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a>. So again, the first level of [[insight]], when there's no [[clinging]], <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a> - and I think this probably goes back to what John was saying about [[dependent origination]] - the [[clinging]], the [[craving]], when that's there, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> comes, and we can look at that link in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a>, relax the [[clinging]], relax the [[craving]], relax the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a>. and we feel the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> go out of [[experience]].

What we begin to see is that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a> makes the way the world appears. It makes the way things appear.

<span class="paragraph">So when we're practising mettā at a very deep level towards objects, there's this non-grasping, and there's a fading, because objects, for their existence, need to be grasped at. They need to have some kind of tussle going on with them, either for or against or whatever. So this is completely counterintuitive. We tend to think, "Well, of course an object exists. It doesn't need me to do anything to it." But we begin to see: the appearance of something depends on the grasping. So there is no _thing_, there is no _real thing_ that is independent of grasping, of clinging, of what the mind is doing with it. No thing, no problem. If a thing isn't real, it can't be a real problem.</span>

<span class="paragraph">In the depths of [[love]], there is this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a>.

<span class="paragraph">Seeing more [[emptiness]] brings with it [[freedom]] and [[love]]. It's an inevitable outcome of seeing [[emptiness]]: [[freedom]] and [[love]].

So [[emptiness]] sounds very <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nihilism" data-href="Nihilism" class="internal-link">nihilistic</a>, a kind of depressing, dry word, but actually the indicator of it is [[love]] and [[freedom]]. ==Seeing [[emptiness]] leads to [[love]] and [[compassion]], because it's kind of done away with the reality of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a>, with the reality of barriers, with the reality of real problems, real faults, with the investment we have in self-inflating or self-depreciation.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">And eventually - as I said, we're just beginning here - but eventually where the practice goes is, we begin to see it's all empty. It's all empty. And this isn't <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nihilism" data-href="Nihilism" class="internal-link">nihilistic</a> at all. There's something very beautiful in this. So self is empty, selves are empty, things are empty, inner things, outer things (so-called). Begin to also see minds are empty. And actually <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> is empty too. All of it, all of it, all of it. And somehow, kind of mysteriously, or even paradoxically, seeing even that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> [doesn't really exist], that beings who suffer don't really exist, somehow it leads to even more [[love]] and [[compassion]].</span>

##### It's something that we go deeper, slowly, gradually, in a non-linear way
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^10-6" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^10-6" class="internal-link">10-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Awakening</a> (2) · <a data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">Stories</a> · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> (3) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (2) · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So listening to that, you know, again, it may sound completely abstract or far removed or whatever. But this is a very real possibility, I'm talking about something very real that's possible for everyone, everyone in the room. We tend to think about [[awakening]], or we hear about [[awakening]], and [[stories]], and people's accounts, and this and that, and we tend to think, you know, one day I'll be either sitting in [[meditation]] - or _not_ sitting in [[meditation]], if that's our view, that it never happens in [[meditation]], it only happens in supermarkets or whatever - and then there'll be this thunderbolt and that will be it. And it will just be over in a flash, and bada-bing, bada-boom, end of el problemo! [laughter] I don't know that it works that way. Maybe for a few people, I don't know. Really I think it's something that we go deeper and deeper, slowly, gradually, usually in a non-linear way, into this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> of [[emptiness]]. And little by little, it becomes clearer and clearer, a more and more full <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>, and deeper and deeper. And it is, it is, it is a very real possibility. As a teacher, I'm just not interested in talking about anything abstract. Just, what's the point? So I'm talking about something very real, that's genuinely possible. Even if it feels right now that, you know, "I can't relate."</span>

<span class="paragraph">And so, just finally, when we talk about love, when we talk about the kind of scope and the range of love, we may already very clearly have a sense in our own practice that there are levels of love, we could say, or a continuum of love. And we as human beings, our consciousness, our heart, moves along that continuum. That's the nature of being human. And there's a kind of humility in that, that it _will_ move along this continuum. So sometimes we cannot find a sense of love, we cannot find any feeling there. All we can do is the very basic thing of planting the seeds of intention, planting the seeds of loving-kindness and compassion. And that intentionality is an act of love, even if there's no feeling, it feels dry as a bone, or even angry or whatever. And sometimes it goes through all the levels that I've mentioned, to love without an object. But again, it's not that we're always going to stay in one state or another. It's something about being human, the amazing range of human consciousness. It's staggering, the capacity of the range of human consciousness to move along that whole spectrum. And somehow in that, and in accepting that movement, that's where our humanity is and our humility is.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Yeah. You can. Yeah, okay. Did everyone hear that? You can do that. In a way, there are a couple of different things that could be going on there. One is giving the tree mettā as a tree, as a perhaps sentient being - I don't know. And that's one level. And that would come under mettā towards beings still. But then there's another level, or another slight emphasis on practice, which we're now moving to a bit more, which is mettā to the sight, so to that impression in consciousness, that image in consciousness as a dharma, as an experience, and whatever is there, clouds or whatever. Yeah, you can absolutely do that. You can experiment with this, but you may find that seeing the kind of relationships that I've been talking about will probably be clearer when you're doing it towards things like body sensations and emotions and thoughts and that kind of stuff internally. But it's interesting what happens when you do it also towards sound and towards sight. So experiment. What I think _I'm_ interested in is beginning to see this relationship. So don't always go where perhaps the relationship is harder to see. Spend some time where you really begin to see, "Ah, there's something going on here." Does that make sense?</span>

<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^12-6" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^12-6" class="internal-link">12-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Yeah, sure. So that would - and in the course of doing that, you began to notice that the relationship was a factor? Is that what you're saying? That's fine. I mean, I think that would correlate with, I can't remember which talk I gave, but maybe two back, when I was talking about bringing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a> into the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice. So actually seeing something is transient, or seeing it as empty and dependent on conditions, and then giving the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> towards that. But yeah, that's fine. The relationship can become clear that way. There's something about noticing how influential the inner relationship with something is, and especially because we've been doing the [[love]] and [[compassion]], it's already current at that, and using that current to make an effect on [[perception]]. It can be really clear, and then it's undeniably clear that there's a relationship. It's very clear. That's all. But any way that it happens, it's great. I would say try doing it the other way round, so just that, and seeing if you can notice it that way too. Does that answer?</span>

<span class="paragraph">Yogi: There was a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a> during the practice.

<span class="paragraph">Rob: It could be viewed that way, because ==when I say, "If I'm loving myself, what am I?", one level of looking at it in terms of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a> is, I am just these experiences and my relationship with them.

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Yes, because - that's what I'm saying - in the depths, as <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> really deepens, it has this quality of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">non-clinging</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-craving</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a>.

<span class="paragraph">Rob: I should go over that again. What I'm suggesting for this final week is to choose two practices: either the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> and this new practice, or the [[compassion]] and this new practice. Now, what you may want to do is really emphasize the new practice and just do a little bit of either the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> or the [[compassion]]. Or you may want to just really emphasize the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> or the [[compassion]] and a little bit of the new practice. Or half and half. The balance, I don't [[mind]] so much about. I think the only thing really in there is maybe not at this point to mix the pure <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> and the pure [[compassion]] practice. Okay? That's the only combination that's not … Within this new practice, sometimes it will feel more like <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> towards [[experience]], objects; sometimes it will feel more like [[compassion]]; sometimes it will just feel like [[acceptance]]. That's where it doesn't really matter. It's just words, and just to go with whatever seems helpful with that. Okay?</span>

<span class="paragraph">Yogi 2: I'm finding it really hard to understand how you can't mix <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Compassion" data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">karuṇā</a>. Because in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Compassion" data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">karuṇā</a> or the [[compassion]], you're having to do [[acceptance]] with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>. There is a degree of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> there. So I get confused when you say don't mix them.</span>

##### Rob: Compassion practice tunes into suffering, and the outgoing healing can feel like metta
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^14-1" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^14-1" class="internal-link">14-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (4) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (4) · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (5) · <a data-href="Healing" class="internal-link">Healing</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Yeah. The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice and the [[compassion]] practice, they will at times - at times, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> seems so much like [[compassion]], and at times [[compassion]], you know, when there's not a lot of [[consciousness]] of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, it feels very much like <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>. So there is a spectrum there, and they kind of tend to blend. Just to reiterate, then: the [[compassion]] practice, it tunes into <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. It just hones into the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, that resonance of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. And it stays there with that, receptive to that, sensitive to that, and then addresses that with what goes out, with the [[healing]]. Now, sometimes that will _feel_ more like a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice, and sometimes less so, but the point is that it's receptive to, sensitive to, and directed to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. That's all. That they feel similar and that they involve each other - don't worry about that.</span>

As I sat, I felt my fingers were numb. So I went in and I met that [[experience]]: what does this feel like? Then I checked out my reaction to that: am I not liking it? And then I brought in a sense of just bringing [[acceptance]] toward all of that. Does that seem, that kind of sequential way of doing things, is that a valid way …?</span>

[laughter] So you could skip that. Also, what will happen with practice is you get very quick at doing it. ==So it's just whatever's in [[consciousness]], whatever's prominent, there the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> goes. And also quite quick to see what the relationship with things is. With practice, it just becomes very evident: there's some slight [[aversion]] here. And it's clear, and then the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> comes in or the [[compassion]] or whatever.== But what you're describing is great.

<span class="paragraph">Rob: When this gets very subtle, an analogy is that attention is kind of like prongs, calipers - it does _that._ And to see you now, I'm kind of … [laughter] It goes on in a very subtle way. There's a kind of grasping that goes on with attention. But we can also see that we can be paying attention to something, and then when we let go of a lot of grasping, that thing that we're paying attention to actually begins to blur and to fade. So it can be easier to see with the eyes closed and working with internal things, but eventually it's actually possible with your eyes open and with sound and everything. So grasping comes into perception. Grasping is _part_ of perception, put it that way. It's part of perception. No grasping, no perception. But it's extremely subtle. In attention, there is a kind of grasping to. That's great.</span>

[laughter] At first, it can seem like an abstract question, but as one goes into this practice and you really see no <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a>, no [[perception]], it becomes a very real question: "I thought awakened people were not supposed to grasp." I've asked a number of people this question. [laughter] So a couple of things. One of my teachers, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Thanissaro Bhikkhu" data-href="Thanissaro Bhikkhu" class="internal-link">Ajaan Ṭhānissaro</a>, he said, "I don't know. Ask an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">arahant</a>." [laughter] Which I thought was a perfectly valid answer. In the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tibetan Buddhism" data-href="Tibetan Buddhism" class="internal-link">Tibetan tradition</a>, which I think, it sounds weird when you first hear it, but when you really go into practice, you see, "Well, maybe there's really something to this," only a <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>, only a fully <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightened</a> person can actually see the [[emptiness]] of something and perceive it at the same time. No other beings can do that. Either you're noticing the [[emptiness]] of something, in which case it fades, or you're considering it real, in which case it's there. ==My take on it, as well, is that a person can be awakened to some degree, and there's basically a momentum of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sankhara" data-href="Sankhara" class="internal-link">saṅkhāras</a>, of karmic momentum, to basically perceive things and things existing really. And that momentum for the duration of their life is enough to keep the world <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearing</a> for them. And then, theoretically, when they die, it all kind of dissolves into whatever it does.== Again, that can seem completely irrelevant and abstract, but as one goes deeper into practice, it becomes like, "Hmm. What is going on here? How would that work?" Yeah. Okay?</span>

<span class="paragraph">Yogi 2: That was pretty much my question.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**Q7: describing meditative states as '[[emptiness]]'**</span>

##### Yogi: Is emptiness the concept that nothing exists in and of itself?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^16-4" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^16-4" class="internal-link">16-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: Just to make sure that I understood completely … well, not completely, but a little better. When you talk about [[emptiness]], you're not talking about a thing; you're talking about a concept which says that nothing exists in and of itself? It only exists because of all of the conditions that arise that lead to its arising?</span>

---
##### Rob: That I cannot say how a thing is, that is the meaning of emptiness
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^16-5" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^16-5" class="internal-link">16-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> (8) · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> · <a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: And it doesn't exist in any real, independent way. I cannot say how a thing is, because of what I said. And even for a thing to arise, it needs me to be _making_ it somehow. In that way, [[emptiness]] is a concept, or even an adjective: things are empty. What we can also talk about, in practice terms, is states of relative [[emptiness]]. So it's using the word a little bit incorrectly, but it's valid. So there are degrees of very deep [[meditation]] we can talk about. That's a state that comes about with a certain level of seeing [[emptiness]] and then another state of [[emptiness]]. And you can talk about that too. But [[emptiness]] as a thing, strictly speaking, no, it's not really a thing. What you could also talk about is the complete <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a> of everything - all [[perception]], all notion of time, all notion of subject, object, anything at all, self, thing, etc. Complete <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a> of everything. And what's left there, if you can even speak that way, you could talk about <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> with a big E, or _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">nirvāṇa</a>,_ or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a>, or whatever language you want. So some people use it that way as well. But that's not really a thing either. Language is really stopped way short of that.</span>

##### Yogi: What's with awareness remaining after dropping away of the sense of a separate self?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^16-6" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^16-6" class="internal-link">16-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: Say in states when there is really no sense of separate self, there's still [[awareness]]. So that would be a condition …</span>

---
##### Rob: progressive deconstrucing
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^16-7" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^16-7" class="internal-link">16-7</a>**: _<a data-href="Oneness" class="internal-link">Oneness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: It would be a condition, because there's still some object that's existing. At first, what can happen when we go into those kind of states, we think, "Well, everything's disappeared." But actually, looking again, you see, "No, there's still a subtle sense of something or other," even a sense of nothingness or [[oneness]] or time or whatever. So it's just this progressive deconstructing, in a way, you could say.</span>

##### Yogi: "awareness without an object"?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^16-8" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^16-8" class="internal-link">16-8</a>**: _<a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">Dimensionality</a> · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: The [[experience]] you were talking about previously, there is no object in that [[experience]]. Where there's no time, no <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a>, no - that's [[awareness]] without an object.</span>

---
##### Rob: Language is stopped short
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^16-9" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^16-9" class="internal-link">16-9</a>**: _<a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> (3)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: You could, some people use that word, '[[awareness]] without an object.' Some people prefer to say, "Well, actually even there's no [[awareness]] there, because you can't really call it [[awareness]]." Again, like I said, the language is stopped short. It's gone beyond language, so it's difficult.</span>

<div class="admonition warning"><div class="title">terminology</div><div class="content">
</div></div>

In <a data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">Phenomenology</a> (the branch of Continental Philosophy), consciousness is always "intentional", i.e. directed towards an object. Rob intentionally (no pun intended) conflates "awareness" and "consciousness", so viewed from the conceptual framework of phenomenology, an awareness without an object would not only not be possible but impossible by definition. Rob skillfully avoids terminology wars here.

##### Yogi: 2 practices: sending metta to persons and to dharmas ("new")
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^17-2" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^17-2" class="internal-link">17-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (3) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Pain" class="internal-link">Pain</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: On the choice of the practice for the week, we choose <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> or [[compassion]] together with this new kind of [[awareness]]. If I understand, the main difference is that we're sending [[compassion]] to dharmas or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a> or experiences rather than to beings. So we can experiment, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> for a person we have in [[mind]], and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> for the [[pain]] in our knee.</span>

##### Rob: You can switch in a sitting, but be clear which one you're doing
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^17-3" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^17-3" class="internal-link">17-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Yeah. And what I would do is actually be conscious of when you're in one practice and when you're in the other. So, you know, say this sitting would be <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> towards beings, and then another sitting <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> towards objects of [[perception]] or whatever. Maybe halfway through a sitting, you may feel, "Now I want to switch the practice," and that's fine too. But just to be clear which one you're doing, what will help with that.</span>

---
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: So [[awareness]] - we should practise this alternative sense of the object of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> or the [[compassion]].</span>

---
##### Rob: "New practice" is directing metta or compassion to the sense of relation with the object
<span class="counts"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^17-5" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^17-5" class="internal-link">17-5</a></span>

<span class="paragraph">Yogi: Carrying on with [?]. Often if I'm practising, say I'm practising <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> to [?], and in that practice the thought of some <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in that being just brings them to my [[mind]], it shoots into [[compassion]].</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: It does.</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: And vice versa. I'm practising [[compassion]] for someone, for their <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, and something joyful appears. I remember last year you were emphasizing what's important is to be able to distinguish the two sentiments as different from each other. If you can do that, couldn't you free it up a little bit? It doesn't make sense to me to be so rigid; it blocks the flow.</span>

---
##### Rob: They blend into each other, but we want to be sensitive to slight differences
<span class="counts"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^17-10" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^17-10" class="internal-link">17-10</a></span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: [long pause] Okay. [laughter] Sure, yeah. Go for it. If that's what feels helpful, just do it. ==As I said, they will blend and bleed into each other. There is something that comes with just really developing one and staying with one and letting that go through its range, just having one kind of intention. One level, they do blend into each other, and they're mixed, and it's kind of all the same thing anyway; why bother making a difference? On another level, we do want to be - there's a slight difference, and we want to be sensitive to it.==</span>

---
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: [?] What I said was that I will notice the shift while I'm practising that. My sentiment actually changes depending how the object changes for me.</span>

##### Rob: staying with a particular strand of intention
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Love and Emptiness > ^18-1" data-href="0204 Love and Emptiness#^18-1" class="internal-link">18-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (3) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Yeah, sure. And that's good, and that would be part of either a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice or a [[compassion]], to notice when it's actually more like - say a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> practice feels more like a [[compassion]] practice, or a [[compassion]] practice feels more like a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>. That would be part of developing each one. I'm just saying maybe, maybe there's something that comes out of just staying with one deliberately, and seeing it go through that range, and noticing it change colour as part of the practice, but just staying with one strand of intention. But I'm not going to be anal about it, so whatever. Okay?</span>

<span class="paragraph">Yogi: Sometimes there are a lot of objects coming up in this new practice. And it seems kind of difficult to be directing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, or it seems like there's a sense of hurry.</span>

##### Rob: Finding one thing that's a bit more steady and doing it

<span class="paragraph">Rob: I would just maybe choose what's prominent and stay with that. You're just interested in, again, a skilful abiding, and seeing this relationship. Sometimes maybe a lot of objects are coming up, and it might be worth seeing: what's the feeling with a lot of objects coming up? Is there a feeling of "ugh," or agitation, or hurriedness or whatever? And actually giving _that_, because that will be a bit more steady, then giving _that_ the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>. Okay? So finding one thing that's a bit more steady and doing that. Okay? Great.</span>
