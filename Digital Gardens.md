> If HAF wants to develop this transcription project and the transcription website/page, it will all need to be thought/imagined through from the perspective of someone really hungry for specificity, precision, depth, thoroughness, and rigour in the teachings: What would they need? What would help them in their study?

🙏 **Shannon:**
> I would strongly encourage porting the transcripts to a more accessible and web-friendly format than the current one. ... With a body of work this size, web features such as hyperlinking between documents and even within documents (footnote links) become important... With close to 500 talks, the ability to browse the material in different ways (by series/retreat, by theme, by date, by topic, etc) is really necessary.
