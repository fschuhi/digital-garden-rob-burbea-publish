##### Most of the Dharma talks give advice, explain what the Dharma is
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1112 Questioning Awakening > ^1-2" data-href="1112 Questioning Awakening#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> · <a data-href="Sexuality" class="internal-link">Sexuality</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/26010/20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=00:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Okay, good morning, everyone. Over the next three weeks, I think what I'd like to do is really give one long talk, one very long talk, split (I _hope_) just into three. I hope. I really hope. But just to start by putting that in context a little bit. For me, and I would guess for most of the teachers in this tradition, most of the talks that I give or a teacher gives include quite a lot of advice, if you like, or practice possibilities, tips, techniques, etc., regarding all kinds of life challenges, difficulties, situations, _<a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a>_, emotional, psychological, spiritual, to do with communication and speech, relationship, relating, <a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a>, work, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, etc. Also, quite a lot of guidance, and very detailed often, about the lovely side of things, and how <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> can deepen into very lovely spaces, and navigating all that. So all of that is in most talks, or some of that is in most talks. And/or, most talks try and sort of explain the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, if you like; try and actually explain what that teacher's take on the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> is.</span>

##### All that's in the library and Dharma Seed
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1112 Questioning Awakening > ^1-3" data-href="1112 Questioning Awakening#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Dharma Seed" class="internal-link">Dharma Seed</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/26010/20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=02:11" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">All that's in the library. [laughter] And also on <a data-href="Dharma Seed" class="internal-link">Dharma Seed</a>. Of course, when you come to interviews, I really hope that you feel met and that you feel engaged with what you need, practically speaking: something that helps, a shift of something, a tool, something or other. I really hope that's the case. Sometimes what a person needs is just to be listened to.</span>

##### This talk is about the assumptions underneath ho we're conceiving of the Dharma
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1112 Questioning Awakening > ^1-4" data-href="1112 Questioning Awakening#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> (4)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/26010/20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=02:42" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">These talks, or this talk, is not so much any of that. Something different. A different purpose, if you like. ==What I really want to explore is the assumptions underneath how we think of and conceive the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, practice, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>, etc. The way we think and conceive of the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, and the assumptions _underneath_ how we're thinking of and conceiving of practice, path, <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, are not often at the forefront of our minds. They're sort of somewhere at the back, and the assumptions are often _really_ buried.== They're not often what we investigate. They're not often investigated. So I would like, if possible, to shine a little light on that whole level of things, and question. Question. Really, this is about questioning.</span>

---
##### I want to open out a whole area
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1112 Questioning Awakening > ^1-5" data-href="1112 Questioning Awakening#^1-5" class="internal-link">1-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/26010/20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=03:45" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So three talks over three weeks is a long trajectory, and I'm very aware that when there's a long structure like that, it's actually hard for a listener to hold it together and see how things are fitting together. I'm very aware of that - even when there's a linear structure. I've done that in here before in different, other <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a>. The structure of these talks is even not so linear. We'll be touching on something, mentioning it, coming back, returning, etc. What I really want to do is open out, open out a whole area, open out what may have become quite entrenched and unexamined ideas that actually have a lot of power in our lives and in relation to our practice. So I hope each talk stands alone, but really it's the three together. I'll basically do the best that I can with what I think is a really enormous and enormously important area.</span>

##### You are free to leave
<span class="counts"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1112 Questioning Awakening > ^1-6" data-href="1112 Questioning Awakening#^1-6" class="internal-link">1-6</a></span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/26010/20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=04:44" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Okay. Having said all that, you are free to leave now. [laughter] Seriously, I mean it. If you feel, "I'm not up for that," that's cool. [laughter] It's not a joke! I'm serious! [laughter] You really all want to stay? I don't take it personally. Okay.</span>

---
##### There has been a shift in the concept of awakening, as (1. trend) it is referred much less nowadays
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1112 Questioning Awakening > ^2-1" data-href="1112 Questioning Awakening#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a> · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> (3) · <a data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Awakening</a> (7)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/26010/20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=05:01" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">All right, so I mentioned this in the talk that we gave on the first morning about _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_. Just looking around us, even just at <a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a> or the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a> tradition, what a _huge_ range of views exists, or is on offer to us, of what <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a> is, what the goal is, actually what the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> is. It's really, really wide, and quite divergent. There's a range of views that all of us are going to encounter. We _do_ encounter it. Even regarding something like <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a> or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightenment</a>. I was speaking on the phone with a teacher in another country just the other day, and he's been in the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> scene internationally for, I think, more than forty years. He's really quite long-standing. He was asking me, "Has there been a shift? I'm not sure if I'm seeing this right. Has there been some kind of shift over the years, and over the decades, in relationship to <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a> and the question of <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a>?" We were talking a little bit, and I think I would agree with him, that he _is_ picking up a shift. If you listen back to talks from the seventies, eighties, nineties, etc., there is a shift. There has been and is a shift. Looking at that whole area of the concept of <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a>, what sometimes we see over those decades in this tradition is a disappearing, a disappearing of any reference to that word or that idea, '<a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a>,' '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightenment</a>.' It's not referred to much, or referred to much less. It's not used very much. It's disappeared off the scene a little bit, or quite a lot in some instances. So that's one trend.</span>

---
##### 2. trend: the meaning of "awakening" has been lowered
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1112 Questioning Awakening > ^2-2" data-href="1112 Questioning Awakening#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Awakening</a> (3) · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> · <a data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">Papanca</a> · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/26010/20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=07:01" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">A second trend is that the _meaning_ of '<a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a>' or '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightenment</a>' has, if you like, been lowered, really. It's become much less of a big deal, so that sometimes, very popularly now, if it means anything at all, it kind of means being in this world without '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">selfing</a>.' What does that mean? It means dragging in the past and projecting the future, dragging in the past resentments and obscurations of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a>_, etc. Being in this world without that, freshly, so that the process of the psychophysical organism is just unfolding to reveal fresh, direct <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a> of this world. That's what <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a> has come to mean for some people, very popularly. That's a second trend.</span>

---
##### 3. trend: ossification (rigidity of ideation of what we're talking about
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1112 Questioning Awakening > ^2-3" data-href="1112 Questioning Awakening#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Awakening</a> (2) · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anatta</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/26010/20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=07:56" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">A third trend is actually a kind of ossification. The whole idea of what <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a> is has become almost like unquestioningly, rigidly set: "It's this." That happens in a lot of different traditions - in some of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a> traditions, but also some traditions outside, for instance the Advaita tradition. If you listen to someone who claims <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a>, it's always the same story. What's going on? It's the same, "_Da-da-da-da_, and then I stopped trying, and now I have <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">no self</a>, and I never have any self." Of course, you could see that same ossification in other traditions.</span>

---
##### What's underneath those trends?
<span class="counts"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1112 Questioning Awakening > ^2-4" data-href="1112 Questioning Awakening#^2-4" class="internal-link">2-4</a></span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/26010/20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=08:41" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So, if either disappearance, or lowered meaning, or ossification (this rigidity of ideation of what we're talking about), if any of those are occurring, _why?_ Why has that happened? What's gone on? What's underneath those trends? If you're listening, and you think in relation to the fact that it may be getting much less frequent, may kind of have disappeared, or it might have lowered its meaning, and you think, "So what?", you're very free to think that. But I would, again, ask, "Why do you think that?" What's going on in your response of "so what?" What's underneath the "so what"?</span>

##### Different "packages" of what the Dharma is: live of mindfulness; existentialist Dharma
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1112 Questioning Awakening > ^2-5" data-href="1112 Questioning Awakening#^2-5" class="internal-link">2-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> (4) · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Awakening</a> (2) · <a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> · <a data-href="Sigmund Freud" class="internal-link">Sigmund Freud</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/26010/20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=09:31" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So there's this range. There's a huge range, and wrapped up in the range of the kinds of <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> there are is the sense of where we're going, what we want, what the goal is, if you like. To compare a few sort of different packages, if you like, of <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> and goal: for some people, for many people, what the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> _is_ is really the attempt or aspiration to live a life of presence, to be present to life, to live a life of <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a>. And that's pretty much it. Maybe <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a> as well. Living a life of presence and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>. I'm going to run through a whole list here. Connected with that, people say, "I want to live life to the full." That's the sense of goal: I want to be _alive_. Another package - these are not separate; they're more like currents that exist, so they can overlap and get mixed, etc. But to artificially separate them a little: for some, it's more a kind of - no one really uses this phrase, I don't think, but it's a kind of what we could call 'existentialist <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>.' The <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a> there, if you like, is realizing the existential limits of our existence. We're <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a>, fragile beings, cast into a world we don't really understand that appears meaningless to us, and we have to accept that, bear up to it, open to it, be brave enough to see that, deal with it. The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> that comes in is kind of neurotic, in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sigmund Freud" data-href="Sigmund Freud" class="internal-link">Freud</a>'s sense of refusing to suffer. That's his definition of 'neurosis.' It's like refusing to accept that this is our lot. Once one accepts that and the limitations of that, that's the kind of <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a>.</span>

##### In principle, we are free to believe what we want - but are we really free to inquire?

<span class="paragraph">So these are currents, as I said, not completely separate. To say again what I think I said last time: we are, in principle, free. In principle, you are free to believe and think whatever you want. In principle you are free to hold any view. But what I want to ask is, =="Are we _really_ free?" Are we really free to inquire into the views that we hold? Or are we blinkered and blinded by assumptions that we don't even realize that we have?== In principle, we're free. You can think anything you want, have any view you want about the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>. But are we really free to inquire? Now, as I talk today, you will probably quite quickly realize that I have my biases in that range of examples I just gave. Of course I do. Everyone does. ==So please don't be biased by _my_ biases. If you don't agree with my bias, that's completely fine. What I really want to get to is the importance of questioning, not that I want to convince you of a certain bias I have within that range. The questioning is the important thing, okay?==</span>

##### As Buddhist, we have a common language: the Four Noble Truths, but this entails rebirth

<span class="paragraph">Now, if you see yourself as a Buddhist - and maybe some of you do; maybe a lot of you do - we have, as Buddhists, a common language, usually: the <a data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Four Noble Truths</a>. It can seem, because we keep referring to things like the <a data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Four Noble Truths</a>, and things like <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, and this kind of common language, it can seem that we're all really talking about the same thing. It can _seem_ that way, but it might be an illusion of the language. If one looks into the <a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a>, the original set of teachings of the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>, it's hard - it's actually impossible - to _not_ realize that the goal he was talking about, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Four Noble Truths" data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Third Noble Truth</a>, involved, ultimately, not being reborn again into this world of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samsara" data-href="Samsara" class="internal-link">saṃsāra</a>_. It was an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Rebirth" data-href="Rebirth" class="internal-link">ending of rebirth</a> that was equated with a final <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a>. We can try and erase that because we don't like it, or it's not the way we think nowadays, etc., but that's there. It's a transcendent teaching. ==There's a thrust of transcendence that runs through <a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a> teachings.== We don't often talk about it these days, but it's there. Nowadays, even in this room, how many people even believe in <a data-href="rebirth" class="internal-link">rebirth</a>? Like, really believe in <a data-href="rebirth" class="internal-link">rebirth</a>? Some, probably. My guess is less than half of the people in here, but who knows? Most people don't. So if I take away 'ending <a data-href="rebirth" class="internal-link">rebirth</a>' as equating that with the goal, the final goal of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Four Noble Truths" data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Third Noble Truth</a>, the cessation of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, the whole structure starts to lose its substance.</span>

And those interpretations will affect the whole package, the whole thrust, the whole tenor, flavour, feel, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">mythos</a> and ethos of what we call 'the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>,' or what the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> is to us.

<span class="paragraph">Even just the meaning of '<a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>,' the place of <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>, what it means and what place it has.

That's what you need for deep <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>. That definition or thrust of <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> automatically implies something about what _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ is and what its place is.

<span class="paragraph">Contrary to that, in some Sōtō <a data-href="Zen" class="internal-link">Zen</a> schools, the everyday and the ordinary is what's important. There's this elevation of the ordinary. So _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, as a kind of non-ordinary range of states, becomes irrelevant. It has no place, because it's not ordinary. In many of the Advaita traditions, what's axiomatic and cardinal is there's nothing to do. "Don't do," actually, is the instruction. So _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ automatically is a non-option, because it must involve doing. In the kind of packages that are about being with life, being with <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> as <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>, _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ seems like it's not being with life - something else happens; life seems to disappear and just become a radiant ball of nice <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>. I'm not, then, being with life. Or in the existentialist schools, they assume "this is what I need to be with, this existential situation." Again, it becomes irrelevant. Or if the view of the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> is really what we're doing is releasing, purifying old wounds, old hurts, old karmic knots, <a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a> childhood trauma, then actually _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ - those kinds of states - are regarded as escapes, 'spiritual bypassing,' as the phrase goes. That phrase has become so entrenched as to become almost unquestioned as a concept. In that package, the more miserable you are, the better, because that's the real purification. Then you're really with the real stuff.</span>

<span class="paragraph">All this is there, in big ways and small ways. Couple with that the relationship with goals itself, and the relationship with doing.

<span class="paragraph">Why is that different than the notion of goals and doing on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>? What's the difference? How does it _become_ different? All this is involved. Predisposition to certain styles. I was talking with someone who said, "I want simplicity." This is absolutely pervasive in the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> world, not just the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a> tradition. Simplicity becomes so important for us. Why? What's going on there? So there's predisposition, but there are also assumptions and ideologies about simplicity: "An awakened person is a simple person. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">The path</a> must be simple. Practice must be simple. Simplicity is where we're going." Why? Where do we get that from? It's predispositions, but ideas, ideologies, underneath, propped up by assumptions that are not usually investigated fully. So the whole dichotomy between 'being' and 'doing' would be another one.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So what do we want? What do _you_ want? I ran through a whole list before very briefly, but let's pick out some of those and unpack them a little bit. This life of <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a>, or presence, or wanting to live life to the full - it's a very popular notion, and not just in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma circles</a>. People want to go parachuting before they die, or whatever it is. If you know you're going to die, you go on an exotic holiday. Packing <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> - maybe just maximizing pleasurable <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>; maybe just wanting intense <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>. Somehow wanting to live life to the full. What does it mean? In these kind of circles, it gets more refined than that. So it's just about the presence, the fullness of presence: "I don't need to go bungee jumping, but I want to live life to the full." How many people think that way and say that way? ==Do I dare to ask, "Why?" Why do I want to live life to the full? Why? Why do I want to savour the moment, savour the <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, the taste, the breeze on the cheek? Why?== It seems like the most obvious thing.

<span class="paragraph">Is it because that's what the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> taught, that's what he said? He taught about savouring the moment?

It's not in the <a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a>.

If you can't be present to that, you won't even be present to enjoy your cup of tea. You'll miss life." That's not in the <a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a>. That's not what the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> was teaching.

<span class="paragraph">When we say 'life,' what do we think we mean, or what do we mean? It trips off the tongue so easily: life this, life that. What do we actually mean by it? And what on earth do we mean by living life to the full? Being with life - what we usually mean is being with life _as we <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> it_, and we take that as being 'reality.' There's something about reality assumptions wrapped up here. Something about reality assumptions wrapped up in that whole rhetoric. Is it reality? What we call 'life,' and assume so readily - "I can be with it," etc. - is it really reality? Or is it empty, as the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s teachings would say? They're empty. It's not 'reality' in the sense that we think it is. Just in terms of cultural differences, we modernists, if you like - scientific materialists, secular humanists - we assume, don't we, that we have already or that we _can_ strip off our beliefs, strip off any beliefs and any projections, and approach life and <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> 'life' (in inverted commas) as it is. We assume that, way too readily. Is that really the case? We may perhaps assume that if those medieval Europeans weren't forced to believe some church <a data-href="dogma" class="internal-link">dogma</a>, they would actually see and <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> 'life' (in inverted commas) straightly and directly, as we do - purely, without the projection.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Wrapped up here are very popular notions nowadays. Hidden in to the usual way we talk about <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a>, the usual way we communicate <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> teachings, are a whole bunch of assumptions, a whole bunch of unexplored assumptions about reality. <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> and all that, and presence, and being with life, has found its way into the culture too. It's informed the culture, the _Weltanschauung_, the world-view. Probably more importantly, the current world-view, the current modernist world-view, has found its way into the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>. It has impregnated the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> with its assumptions and its views. You see it all over the place, all over the place in the movies, in Hollywood, etc. I don't know if any of you saw this twee little movie, _About Time_. {note: "About Time" https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194499/} Did anyone see that? It was quite cute, and a little bit funny. I can't quite remember - it's about a guy. The males in the family can travel in time. They can, I think, go back and do something again. So this guy realizes it, and he does that, and he goes back to when he's made an idiot of himself or he hasn't impressed the girl that he wants to impress. He goes back, and then gets to impress her and stuff like that. He's talking with his dad, who has had this ability for a while. It runs on, and it's funny and cute. But at the end, or towards the end, there's a sort of moral that is given, partly explicitly, and implicitly. The dad kind of says to the son, "Look, it's all great, this ability to do this. But now, actually, I don't do it. The most important thing now is _being with_ <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, _being with_ actuality as it is, without changing it. Living to the full, living each day as if it's your last. Being in the now, savouring." I can't remember the exact words, but that was in the sort of little moral of it.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Implicit in that, in a slightly confused way, because it was involved with time travel and all that, is this idea that this is reality: "This is reality, and therefore it needs to be respected." But if one realizes that this is _not_ reality, _this_ is not reality - that now_,_ without saying it's something else, this is not reality. Without saying reality is something else, _this_ and _now_ are not. What if one realizes that, in whatever way? It's not reality. Then that whole rhetoric and elevation of _this_ and _now_ collapses. It loses its <a data-href="meaningfulness" class="internal-link">meaningfulness</a>. It loses its primacy. Its power and its appeal are tied in with, and they come from, hidden <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metaphysics" data-href="Metaphysics" class="internal-link">metaphysical</a> assumptions about reality.</span>

<span class="paragraph">About this <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> and presence and living life to the full: could we separate <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> as a simple strategy, as one strategy among many possible strategies? One way. A strategy of dealing with and coping with and responding to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a>, thoughts and <a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a>. And separate that from <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> as a kind of religion - an unconscious religion, a religion that poses as areligious, or assumes it's areligious. And I mean 'religion' in the worst sense of the word here, in terms of being full of unquestioned - in this case, modernist - assumptions, and maybe reductionist materialist, maybe others. Full of unquestioned assumptions about reality. ==If we don't separate those two, what's a simple strategy (one among many), from what's wrapped up with a whole ideology, it has a lot of consequences for the range and the power and the depth of my investigation, and for the range and power and depth of experiences that open up for me.== In both of those (my investigation and my experiences), a lot of what could be very beneficial and very insightful gets circumscribed, gets limited. The range is limited.</span>

##### Is simple mindfulness rich enough as a philosophy or as a psychology?

<span class="paragraph">Let's explore this a little bit: <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> as a kind of coping strategy for the sake of reducing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. Okay? Here's a question. Is that enough, being <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a> in order to reduce <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>? Is it enough in the sense of will it reduce enough of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, enough of the _<a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a>_? Does it go deep enough as a strategy? But even more than that (and I just mention this because I talked about it in other talks; I won't get into it today), is the whole thrust of wanting to reduce <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, the whole tenor and thrust of that, is that enough for us as human beings? Is that enough for the <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a> and the <a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a>?

Is it interesting enough, wide enough, rich enough, as a philosophy or as a psychology? I'm just going to throw that out. I've talked about it in other talks. I'm not going to talk about it today. It's the other piece that I want to dwell on today.</span>

##### Mindfulness as a coping strategy of the (assumed real, common sense) existential predicament
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1112 Questioning Awakening > ^9-1" data-href="1112 Questioning Awakening#^9-1" class="internal-link">9-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> (3) · <a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a> · <a data-href="Death" class="internal-link">Death</a> · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/26010/20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=43:20" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Often this <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> or 'being in the now' is seen as a coping strategy, as a way of being in our assumed real, existential predicament: "Things _are_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a>. Things _are_ uncertain. Life _is_ uncertain. <a data-href="Death" class="internal-link">Death</a> is coming - that's certain. We're living on shifting sands. The reality of things is just flow. Everything is moving. This is our existential predicament." It's _assumed_ real. So <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> is the way of meeting that, coping with it. ==Rather than seeing <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> and <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a>, then, as being part of a thrust of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> reality, seeing a deeper level of reality, in this case reality is given with common sense.== Listen to the words: common sense. Maybe we throw in, "And <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> is a momentary arising process, which is not-so-obvious common sense." But that's about it. Reality is given with common sense, and we cope and deal with it and be with it.</span>

##### Example: realizing eternal awareness vs it's just your brain doing weird stuff
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1112 Questioning Awakening > ^9-2" data-href="1112 Questioning Awakening#^9-2" class="internal-link">9-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> (5) · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So this opens up a really interesting thing. Some people, some practitioners, they have a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation experience</a>, and it therefore becomes a truth. I'll pick one example just because it's very simple and common: "In my <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>, the sense of <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> opened out, and was vast and enormous and beautiful and unchanging. Everything else was coming and going within that, and it seemed eternal. Then everything seemed like it _was_ <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>." They'll say, "It's true." How do you know it's true? "Well, I saw it in <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>." Someone else goes, "So what if you saw it in <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>? It's just your brain doing weird stuff because <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> is a weird thing and it affects your neurons." One view, another view. Is there an alternative? Or what might be an alternative?</span>

##### How are we going to know, and how are we going to decide, what is real?

<span class="paragraph">One possible alternative is actually seeing what happens, exploring the range of perceptual change, in and out of different states of <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> how those perceptual shifts dependently arise and dependently cease. That would be _an_ alternative. But what I really want to say here is: look, there's a question here, is there not? How are we going to know, and how are we going to decide, what is real?</span>

##### There is always an assumption about metaphysics

<span class="paragraph">This isn't abstract, because this affects the whole texture of your sense of existence. The whole sense of <a data-href="meaningfulness" class="internal-link">meaningfulness</a> in your life, the whole vision and feel of what your life, existence, and practice is depends on what you believe is real and or not, and what's not real. How are we going to know? How are we going to decide? In philosophy, <a data-href="ontology" class="internal-link">ontology</a> is the study of what is real and what is not, and how real, etc. <a data-href="Ontology" class="internal-link">Ontology</a> always comes into it. And <a data-href="epistemology" class="internal-link">epistemology</a> in philosophy is the study of how we know things, how we know, for instance, what is real and what is not. <a data-href="Ontology" class="internal-link">Ontology</a> and <a data-href="epistemology" class="internal-link">epistemology</a> are part of what in philosophy is called <a data-href="metaphysics" class="internal-link">metaphysics</a>, along with <a data-href="cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmology</a>, which means, "What is this universe that I'm in, and how is it ordered, and what's its structure?" ==It's impossible to get away from that. You can _think_ you're away from it, you can _assume_ you're away from it. It's impossible to get away from <a data-href="ontology" class="internal-link">ontology</a>, <a data-href="epistemology" class="internal-link">epistemology</a>,<a data-href="cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmology</a> - <a data-href="metaphysics" class="internal-link">metaphysics</a>. And always we have to assume something. There is always an assumption that ends up being actually unprovable - always.== Interesting predicament. Maybe that's more our existential predicament than what is usually regarded as our existential predicament.</span>

##### Mythos of optimizing the "biological machine"
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1112 Questioning Awakening > ^10-1" data-href="1112 Questioning Awakening#^10-1" class="internal-link">10-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> (3) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> · <a data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">Fantasy</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So that whole list before, let's pick out another one: this biological machine. It's rare that you'll get a teacher or someone actually staring you in the face and saying, "You are a biological machine. You are basically evolved over millennia - a very sophisticated, breathtakingly sophisticated neurological machine and biological machine." But sometimes that is underpinning. That view, if you poke at it enough, it's underpinning someone's presentation of what <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> or <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> is, etc. "You can learn to reprogram the software of this astonishing computer." Sometimes they'll show you slides of the brain, and how people with <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a>, who do a lot of <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> practice, a certain membrane in the brain grows a little bit thicker, or this - I don't know the words - sort of gets a little bit bigger or smaller or this or that. So sometimes even the hardware of your machine can be affected just a little bit. But what we want, or what's possible, is that machine, that biological machine that you are, can be made more efficient. Its neurological functioning can be made more efficient, a more smooth process can ensue, and any unnecessary <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> that comes with the hardware before the updated version or whatever can be minimized. View. Ideas. A certain kind of very thin <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">mythos</a> there.</span>

##### Story: retreatant noting on the iPhone

<span class="paragraph">There was a retreatant here a while ago. I asked his permission to share this, and he was fine with it. He was struggling in <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>, <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> drifting. He came up with a way of doing it for himself. He had a little bit of paper, and he was doing the noting technique, where you note "rising, falling," for the in/out <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, or "hearing" or "thinking" or whatever it is. So he was doing that, and he decided actually to write down what happened very quickly. The words were too big, so he had little sort of symbols for in-<a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, out-<a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, thinking, etc. He showed me this little grid chart of a <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> session. It looks like a kind of machine code thing that you would put in. After a little while he said actually this really helps him. I said, "Okay. I've never come across anything like this, but go for it." And then he said, "I found out a way I can do it on my iPhone," and he was explaining to me the technicals. I didn't understand. So he was sitting there in <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>, and he would punch out his noting in this code, and it would look like literally some kind of esoteric computer code. That was his <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> session. But he said, "The <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is bright, and it's really less entangled."</span>

##### There is a sense of what the human being is that is woven into our view of what practice is

<span class="paragraph">How do you feel about that? Probably some people, "Great, fine. I think I'm going to try it." No phones! [laughter] No phones! And some people will feel somewhat horrified, yeah? Why? Why are you horrified? I don't like it, but that's, again, my bias. But I don't want to distort with my bias. The question is, why are you horrified, or turned off, if you're turned off? Is there not a <a data-href="cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmology</a>, a sense of what the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a> is and what the setting is for our practice, that is woven into our very view of what practice is - the ethos, the feel of it? One of my teachers used to give walking instructions, and they were very vague. It's like, "A <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a> walking on the earth." And another teacher I was talking with years later, "He always used to say that. I was like, I don't get what the <a data-href="hell" class="internal-link">hell</a> he's talking about." [laughter] And I wanted to ask this second teacher, because _I_ really related to that, I wanted to ask this second teacher, "Okay, so if some machine could be invented that replicated the exact sensations of, say, walking with bare feet on damp Devon grass, exactly replicated but you're actually inside a machine, so the purpose was the same - sharp <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> of sensations - how would that be?" It's fulfilling the same purpose, is it not? Or _is_ it? Because the <a data-href="cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmology</a> is different, the whole feel for existence, and where we are, and what it means, and what is beautiful, and what is deep - it's different. So all this is wrapped in.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So this biological machine is very popular now. It goes back to the <a data-href="Scientific Revolution" class="internal-link">Scientific Revolution</a> and the so-called Western <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Enlightenment</a> in the seventeenth century, the idea of the universe as machine. Little billiard balls of stuff set in motion somehow, and then mechanically just interacting with each other, ricocheting independent of human observation, and certainly independent of God and all that. Then, in time, you are a machine within this machine. Now you are a computer within a big computer or whatever it is. And it becomes a truth. It becomes a truth. We forget it's a model. It's a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a>. It's a very helpful model. You see medicine, technology, a lot comes out of that model. But is it a truth? Reductionist <a data-href="materialism" class="internal-link">materialism</a>. About 100 years ago, physics - which set the whole thing in motion - started to question, very, very powerfully, pull the rug out from that whole model as a truth. Relativity questioning the objective, independent existence of both space and time, and in quantum mechanics, of the idea of reality being made of little billiard balls, which are independent of the observer, exist at a certain place, in a certain way. And also in Western philosophy, starting around the same time, interestingly, Husserl and people with <a data-href="phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenology</a>. So this idea that that is a _truth_ - it works, but is it a truth? The idea that it's a truth is actually outdated by at least 100 years. Any <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> that's based on that as truth is actually outdated philosophically and intellectually.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Then there's this existentialist one I mentioned, where we're sort of cast, thrown into (to borrow a phrase from Heidegger, I think), cast into a meaningless world, usually of matter, of this kind of independent, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulless</a> matter. A strange existence, perhaps alien. Somehow I'm conscious, and the rest of it is not. Strange, alien. I'm in an alien existence. <a data-href="Death" class="internal-link">Death</a> will come, and <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a> will be an annihilation. And either that's just bleak, or it's terrifying, or it's what came to be called in the Romantic movement =='sublime' - a mixture of terrifying and awesomely beautiful==, to be faced with the abyss of all that, the meaninglessness, and the <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a>, and the annihilation. We're at sea in this, in the fragility, etc. And this is taken as _fact_, as _truth_. And there's only one appropriate and honest response or feeling in relationship to that. Anything else is denial or dishonest. This is the view.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So Blaise Pascal, I can't remember when he lived, but [he was] a mathematician. He also invented the barometer, was a philosopher. "I am terrified," he said. "I am terrified by the eternal silence of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Infinity" data-href="Infinity" class="internal-link">the infinite</a> interstellar spaces. I'm terrified by that." But that and the whole feeling in relationship to the existential situation - can you not see, can we not see, they're from the view of self? It's <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>, the belief in a self looking out at this as reality that feels that way. It's completely dependent on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a> and reality-view. Some people - and I'm one of them - absolutely love the interstellar spaces. I <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> it. It does something in my heart, my <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a>. It does not bring up terrifying <a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a> for me.

<span class="paragraph">Some people say, "There's nothing transcendent." But in <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>, it's possible. It's possible to transcend, to go beyond _this_, beyond <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a>.

They're not little packets of <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>. They're not even waves. What you get if you push a physicist, "What _are_ they?" "Well, you can see them in different ways." "But what are they really?" "Well, I don't know. We have an equation." "What's the equation?" "It's a transcendent mathematical entity. It's an abstract mathematical entity." If you know Schrödinger's wave equation - if you have three particles, three electrons, let's say, what's called the wave function, how it actually is, it's an abstract mathematical entity that exists in nine <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a> (three times three). What does that even mean, nine <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a>? And when you square that in nine <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a>, you get the probability of where this thing, which isn't really a thing, _is_ - if you observe it. [laughter] If that's not transcendent, I don't know what is. It transcends what we usually mean at all by any 'it' or any 'this' or any 'thing' indeed.</span>

> <span class="paragraph">What _is_ an elementary particle? We say, for instance, simply "a neutron," but we can give no well-defined picture of what we mean by the word. We can use several pictures and describe it once as a particle, once as a wave or as a wave packet. But we know that none of these descriptions is accurate.... If one wants to give an accurate description of the elementary particle ... the only thing which can be written down is a probability function [what I just talked about]. But then one sees that not even the quality of _being_ [that it 'is' or 'is not'], if it may be called a quality, belongs to what is described.^[Werner Heisenberg, _Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science_ (New York: Harper & Row, 1962), 70]</span>

<span class="paragraph">Someone at a conference recently said, "We need to be based in reality. We need a <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> based in reality." ... Look, guys, it's been almost an hour. Are you okay if it's a little longer? Yeah? Okay, thanks. "We need a <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> based in reality." What do you mean by 'reality'? Material? We need a <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> based in what is material? Is that what you mean? Do you mean what's tangible, what's "kickable," to quote Samuel Johnson? What's measurable? What's publicly shared? What's socially agreed upon? Is that what you mean by 'reality'? What's secular? What's bound by logic? This is the common notion, that package is the common notion of what we mean by 'reality.' But matter certainly doesn't fulfil all of them, doesn't fulfil even very many of those factors. An electron is not bound by logic. 'A' is not non-'A,' or whatever the thing is. It's not that. It's somehow a superimposition of not being this or that and both. It doesn't fit that. What do we mean by 'reality'? How are we defining 'reality'? And in the existentialist kind of <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, I think it's fair to point out, or ask a person, "Are you attached to a certain view? Are you attached to a certain view of existence for some reason? And what reason?"

<span class="paragraph">Views and ideas, especially at the level of background, underneath assumptions, are _crucial_. And crucial - again, that word, 'crucial,' is from the Latin _crux_, meaning 'cross.' So a crossroads. The views and ideas we have - if I have this one, I go down that road. It unfolds certain <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>. If I have this view and idea, this assumption, it unfolds another one. I go different ways at the crossroads. Crucial. Being with life, being with <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, etc., then things like the whole realm of the imagination become irrelevant, a waste of time. You say, "Well, the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> in the <a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a> doesn't recommend imagination." I'm not sure, but it's not because it's not real.

<span class="paragraph">Someone was telling me they were having a difficulty. I can't remember what it was. They were struggling a little bit, and a friend said, "Love the five-year-old in you who felt this certain way. Love the five-year-old little girl in you who felt a certain way." And she had done a lot of that. And she just, in that moment, "I just, I've done it. Been there, done it. I can't do it any more. It's done for me. That whole way of thinking and relating is done and it won't work any more." She had had, over quite a lot of years, very rarely, but three or four experiences of a figure that came to her imagination - very, very powerful; at first, oppressive, connected with a <a data-href="depression" class="internal-link">depression</a>. A figure with skin like a dark black snake, pitch black. She called him the 'black devil man.'

<span class="paragraph">Over years, something changed, and actually culminated in a sort of explosively erotic encounter with him. That opened up all kinds of things for her, changed the whole psychological dynamics within her. So instead of going to the five-year-old within, she went and stared into the eyes of this black devil man. She said unbelievable strength and power just suffused her, and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> was gone. It took about two seconds. She was completely surprised by what happened. "Wow," she said. Wrapped up in that - again, let's poke at some assumptions, because we tend to assume, "Well, that black devil man had nothing, no source in her <a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a>, wasn't related to anything in her past, some story, some thing that happened - nothing at all." The five-year-old, we tend to think, is more real. There really _is_ this five-year-old, or it relates to the real five-year-old that she was. Or do we consider it being more real?

Because of that, I now have these problems." Is that not a theory? I might have experiences that I feel I remember. It _feels_ like a memory of what happened at six years old, and I'm positing that as an interpretation, positing that as a cause for what happened now. Someone else was telling me recently, and I know this from my own <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, working intensely in certain kinds of psychotherapy, and all this stuff is coming up, stuff coming up, stuff coming up - very intense and difficult, and then wondering, "Is it really true stuff?" ==And the therapist saying, "You've got to hang in there.

Or if they _are_ a little bit intellectual, they'll say, "I don't do <a data-href="metaphysics" class="internal-link">metaphysics</a>. I don't do this questioning of what's real, or questioning of how we know anything, or deciding on what the <a data-href="cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmology</a> is." This is dangerous. Always these assumptions are operating. If I think I'm non-conceptual, I am conceptual. If I think I'm not intellectual, ideas are operating. If I think I've put aside <a data-href="metaphysics" class="internal-link">metaphysics</a>, it's an illusion.</span>

##### Is a wholly different relationship with fundamental ideas possible?

<span class="paragraph">To conclude, for today at least, can we expose the ideas and assumptions that are operating for us? And how do we expose those ideas? How will we inquire into whether an idea or an assumption is true? How? And if I find out that it's not true, is it that another one is true? What other ideas are there? What other views of existence, of practice, of path, of awakening? Is a wholly different relationship with fundamental ideas about reality, about cosmology, about knowing, all that - is a wholly different relationship with fundamental ideas possible? And can that bring very different ways of seeing and feeling existence? Ideas are powerful, and we don't realize how powerful. They _will_ influence, they do influence, everything. Big ideas can open up the whole sense of existence - the questioning, the perception, everything. That opening up won't happen just by 'being with,' or just by being with my feelings, if I'm 'being with' with the same unquestioned ways of looking, unquestioned Conceptual framework, etc., unquestioned metaphysics, really. We somehow need to question and to put in new ideas. Somehow.</span>
