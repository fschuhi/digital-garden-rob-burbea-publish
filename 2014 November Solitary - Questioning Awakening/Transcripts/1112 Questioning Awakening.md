_This talk is the first part of a talk in three parts. (Part 2 is "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhism</a></span> Beyond <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Modernism" class="internal-link">Modernism</a></span>"; Part 3 is "In Praise of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Restlessness</a></span>".)_ ^1-1
###### 1-2
Okay, good morning, everyone. Over the next three weeks, I think what I'd like to do is really give one long talk, one very long talk, split (I _hope_) just into three. I hope. I really hope. But just to start by putting that in context a little bit. For me, and I would guess for most of the teachers in this tradition, most of the talks that I give or a teacher gives include quite a lot of advice, if you like, or practice possibilities, tips, techniques, etc., regarding all kinds of life challenges, difficulties, situations, _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, emotional, psychological, spiritual, to do with communication and speech, relationship, relating, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span>, work, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, etc. Also, quite a lot of guidance, and very detailed often, about the lovely side of things, and how <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> can deepen into very lovely spaces, and navigating all that. So all of that is in most talks, or some of that is in most talks. And/or, most talks try and sort of explain the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, if you like; try and actually explain what that teacher's take on the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> is<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > Most of the Dharma talks give advice explain what the Dharma is" data-href="Questioning Awakening#Most of the Dharma talks give advice explain what the Dharma is" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2

All that's in the library. [laughter] And also on <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma Seed" class="internal-link">Dharma Seed</a></span>. Of course, when you come to interviews, I really hope that you feel met and that you feel engaged with what you need, practically speaking: something that helps, a shift of something, a tool, something or other. I really hope that's the case. Sometimes what a person needs is just to be listened to<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > All thats in the library and Dharma Seed" data-href="Questioning Awakening#All that's in the library and Dharma Seed" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3
###### 1-4
These talks, or this talk, is not so much any of that. Something different. A different purpose, if you like. What I really want to explore is the assumptions underneath how we think of and conceive the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, practice, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>, etc. The way we think and conceive of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, and the assumptions _underneath_ how we're thinking of and conceiving of practice, path, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, are not often at the forefront of our minds. They're sort of somewhere at the back, and the assumptions are often _really_ buried. They're not often what we investigate. They're not often investigated. So I would like, if possible, to shine a little light on that whole level of things, and question. Question. Really, this is about questioning<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > This talk is about the assumptions underneath ho were conceiving of the Dharma" data-href="Questioning Awakening#This talk is about the assumptions underneath ho we're conceiving of the Dharma" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4
###### 1-5
So three talks over three weeks is a long trajectory, and I'm very aware that when there's a long structure like that, it's actually hard for a listener to hold it together and see how things are fitting together. I'm very aware of that - even when there's a linear structure. I've done that in here before in different, other <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span>. The structure of these talks is even not so linear. We'll be touching on something, mentioning it, coming back, returning, etc. What I really want to do is open out, open out a whole area, open out what may have become quite entrenched and unexamined ideas that actually have a lot of power in our lives and in relation to our practice. So I hope each talk stands alone, but really it's the three together. I'll basically do the best that I can with what I think is a really enormous and enormously important area<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > I want to open out a whole area" data-href="Questioning Awakening#I want to open out a whole area" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-5

Okay. Having said all that, you are free to leave now. [laughter] Seriously, I mean it. If you feel, "I'm not up for that," that's cool. [laughter] It's not a joke! I'm serious! [laughter] You really all want to stay? I don't take it personally. Okay<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > You are free to leave" data-href="Questioning Awakening#You are free to leave" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-6
###### 2-1
All right, so I mentioned this in the talk that we gave on the first morning about _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samƒÅdhi</a></span>_. Just looking around us, even just at <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a></span> or the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> tradition, what a _huge_ range of views exists, or is on offer to us, of what <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> is, what the goal is, actually what the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> is. It's really, really wide, and quite divergent. There's a range of views that all of us are going to encounter. We _do_ encounter it. Even regarding something like <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightenment</a></span>. I was speaking on the phone with a teacher in another country just the other day, and he's been in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> scene internationally for, I think, more than forty years. He's really quite long-standing. He was asking me, "Has there been a shift? I'm not sure if I'm seeing this right. Has there been some kind of shift over the years, and over the decades, in relationship to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> and the question of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>?" We were talking a little bit, and I think I would agree with him, that he _is_ picking up a shift. If you listen back to talks from the seventies, eighties, nineties, etc., there is a shift. There has been and is a shift. Looking at that whole area of the concept of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>, what sometimes we see over those decades in this tradition is a disappearing, a disappearing of any reference to that word or that idea, '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>,' '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightenment</a></span>.' It's not referred to much, or referred to much less. It's not used very much. It's disappeared off the scene a little bit, or quite a lot in some instances. So that's one trend<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > There has been a shift in the concept of awakening as 1 trend it is referred much less nowadays" data-href="Questioning Awakening#There has been a shift in the concept of awakening as 1 trend it is referred much less nowadays" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
A second trend is that the _meaning_ of '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>' or '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightenment</a></span>' has, if you like, been lowered, really. It's become much less of a big deal, so that sometimes, very popularly now, if it means anything at all, it kind of means being in this world without '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">selfing</a></span>.' What does that mean? It means dragging in the past and projecting the future, dragging in the past resentments and obscurations of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papa√±ca</a></span>_, etc. Being in this world without that, freshly, so that the process of the psychophysical organism is just unfolding to reveal fresh, direct <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of this world. That's what <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> has come to mean for some people, very popularly. That's a second trend<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > 2 trend the meaning of awakening has been lowered" data-href="Questioning Awakening#2 trend the meaning of awakening has been lowered" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
A third trend is actually a kind of ossification. The whole idea of what <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> is has become almost like unquestioningly, rigidly set: "It's this." That happens in a lot of different traditions - in some of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> traditions, but also some traditions outside, for instance the Advaita tradition. If you listen to someone who claims <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>, it's always the same story. What's going on? It's the same, "_Da-da-da-da_, and then I stopped trying, and now I have <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">no self</a></span>, and I never have any self." Of course, you could see that same ossification in other traditions<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > 3 trend ossification rigidity of ideation of what were talking about" data-href="Questioning Awakening#3 trend ossification rigidity of ideation of what we're talking about" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
So, if either disappearance, or lowered meaning, or ossification (this rigidity of ideation of what we're talking about), if any of those are occurring, _why?_ Why has that happened? What's gone on? What's underneath those trends? If you're listening, and you think in relation to the fact that it may be getting much less frequent, may kind of have disappeared, or it might have lowered its meaning, and you think, "So what?", you're very free to think that. But I would, again, ask, "Why do you think that?" What's going on in your response of "so what?" What's underneath the "so what"<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > Whats underneath those trends" data-href="Questioning Awakening#What's underneath those trends" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^2-4
###### 2-5
So there's this range. There's a huge range, and wrapped up in the range of the kinds of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> there are is the sense of where we're going, what we want, what the goal is, if you like. To compare a few sort of different packages, if you like, of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> and goal: for some people, for many people, what the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> _is_ is really the attempt or aspiration to live a life of presence, to be present to life, to live a life of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>. And that's pretty much it. Maybe <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span> as well. Living a life of presence and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>. I'm going to run through a whole list here. Connected with that, people say, "I want to live life to the full." That's the sense of goal: I want to be _alive_. Another package - these are not separate; they're more like currents that exist, so they can overlap and get mixed, etc. But to artificially separate them a little: for some, it's more a kind of - no one really uses this phrase, I don't think, but it's a kind of what we could call 'existentialist <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>.' The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> there, if you like, is realizing the existential limits of our existence. We're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span>, fragile beings, cast into a world we don't really understand that appears meaningless to us, and we have to accept that, bear up to it, open to it, be brave enough to see that, deal with it. The <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that comes in is kind of neurotic, in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sigmund Freud" data-href="Sigmund Freud" class="internal-link">Freud</a></span>'s sense of refusing to suffer. That's his definition of 'neurosis.' It's like refusing to accept that this is our lot. Once one accepts that and the limitations of that, that's the kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > Different packages of what the Dharma is live of mindfulness; existentialist Dharma" data-href="Questioning Awakening#Different packages of what the Dharma is live of mindfulness; existentialist Dharma" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-5
###### 3-1
Again, there's another model or package where the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> is really seen - people don't often say this explicitly - really seen as a kind of biological machine, a very sophisticated biological machine, evolved, of course, over millennia. Practice and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> and all this is really optimizing the functioning of the nervous system of that machine so that it runs more smoothly, so that it doesn't create problems that may have been there from the hardware - reprogramming the software, within all this, and that's the reality it takes place in<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > Optimizing the biological machine" data-href="Questioning Awakening#Optimizing the biological machine" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
Very different, a further kind of model or package is: where we're going, what we want to see, is that you are <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. You're not any of this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. You are <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. A different version is that everything is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. It's all one. Or it's all <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. These are different <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span> required as sort of goal <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > You are awareness all one or love" data-href="Questioning Awakening#You are awareness all one or love" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
Or we want to know something that is transcendent to this whole realm of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. Transcendent, even, to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. Or we want to understand that all this is empty, all of it: <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, biology, matter, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, space, time. There's a whole range. It's like, "What do I need to understand is empty?" That would be one model or one thrust as well. There are many others, but maybe there's even something beyond _that_<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > We want to know something that is transcendent; understand that all is empty" data-href="Questioning Awakening#We want to know something that is transcendent; understand that all is empty" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3
###### 3-4
So these are currents, as I said, not completely separate. To say again what I think I said last time: we are, in principle, free. In principle, you are free to believe and think whatever you want. In principle you are free to hold any view. But what I want to ask is, "Are we _really_ free?" Are we really free to inquire into the views that we hold? Or are we blinkered and blinded by assumptions that we don't even realize that we have? In principle, we're free. You can think anything you want, have any view you want about the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>. But are we really free to inquire? Now, as I talk today, you will probably quite quickly realize that I have my biases in that range of examples I just gave. Of course I do. Everyone does. So please don't be biased by _my_ biases. If you don't agree with my bias, that's completely fine. What I really want to get to is the importance of questioning, not that I want to convince you of a certain bias I have within that range. The questioning is the important thing, okay<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > In principle we are free to believe what we want - but are we really free to inquire" data-href="Questioning Awakening#In principle we are free to believe what we want - but are we really free to inquire" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^3-4
###### 3-5
Now, if you see yourself as a Buddhist - and maybe some of you do; maybe a lot of you do - we have, as Buddhists, a common language, usually: the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Four Noble Truths</a></span>. It can seem, because we keep referring to things like the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Four Noble Truths</a></span>, and things like <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, and this kind of common language, it can seem that we're all really talking about the same thing. It can _seem_ that way, but it might be an illusion of the language. If one looks into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a></span>, the original set of teachings of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>, it's hard - it's actually impossible - to _not_ realize that the goal he was talking about, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Four Noble Truths" data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Third Noble Truth</a></span>, involved, ultimately, not being reborn again into this world of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samsara" data-href="Samsara" class="internal-link">sa·πÉsƒÅra</a></span>_. It was an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Rebirth" data-href="Rebirth" class="internal-link">ending of rebirth</a></span> that was equated with a final <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>. We can try and erase that because we don't like it, or it's not the way we think nowadays, etc., but that's there. It's a transcendent teaching. There's a thrust of transcendence that runs through <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a></span> teachings. We don't often talk about it these days, but it's there. Nowadays, even in this room, how many people even believe in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="rebirth" class="internal-link">rebirth</a></span>? Like, really believe in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="rebirth" class="internal-link">rebirth</a></span>? Some, probably. My guess is less than half of the people in here, but who knows? Most people don't. So if I take away 'ending <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="rebirth" class="internal-link">rebirth</a></span>' as equating that with the goal, the final goal of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Four Noble Truths" data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Third Noble Truth</a></span>, the cessation of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, the whole structure starts to lose its substance<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > As Buddhist we have a common language the Four Noble Truths but this entails rebirth" data-href="Questioning Awakening#As Buddhist we have a common language the Four Noble Truths but this entails rebirth" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-5
###### 4-1
The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Four Noble Truths</a></span> become more like a skeleton. They need fleshing out, and they'll be fleshed out very individually. I use the word 'skeleton' very particularly. What does <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> mean to you nowadays? Where is this path going, the direction of it, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Four Noble Truths" data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Third Noble Truth</a></span>? There's a huge range there. If the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Four Noble Truths" data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Third Noble Truth</a></span>, the end of _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, is different, then of course the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Four Noble Truths" data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">First Noble Truth</a></span> is different. What are we even talking about when we say _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_? With those two being open, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">liberation</a></span> is open to be defined in different ways. _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a></span>_, even, is open to be defined in different ways. Of course, then the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Four Noble Truths" data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Second Noble Truth</a></span>, the cause of _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, what leads to _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Four Noble Truths" data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Fourth Noble Truth</a></span>, the way, will also be opened. They are available to a multiplicity of interpretations and directions. And those interpretations will affect the whole package, the whole thrust, the whole tenor, flavour, feel, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">mythos</a></span> and ethos of what we call 'the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>,' or what the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> is to us. Massively, massively. In all kinds of ways, big ways and little ways<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > When we use the Four Noble Truths just as a skeleton then this opens up a multiplicity of interpretations" data-href="Questioning Awakening#When we use the Four Noble Truths just as a skeleton then this opens up a multiplicity of interpretations" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-1
###### 4-2
Even just the meaning of '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>,' the place of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, what it means and what place it has. Or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>. Or, coming from that and going even smaller, more particularly, the place and meaning of, say, _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samƒÅdhi</a></span>_. We talked about that in the first talk. So just briefly: for instance, in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahasi Sayadaw" data-href="Mahasi Sayadaw" class="internal-link">MahƒÅsi tradition</a></span>, one of the Burmese schools, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> for them is being able to dissect reality, to dissect the world into atomic units of cessation and matter and moments of time and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, etc. That's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. That's what you need for deep <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. That definition or thrust of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> automatically implies something about what _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samƒÅdhi</a></span>_ is and what its place is. It needs to be small.

Contrary to that, in some S≈çt≈ç <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Zen" class="internal-link">Zen</a></span> schools, the everyday and the ordinary is what's important. There's this elevation of the ordinary. So _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samƒÅdhi</a></span>_, as a kind of non-ordinary range of states, becomes irrelevant. It has no place, because it's not ordinary. In many of the Advaita traditions, what's axiomatic and cardinal is there's nothing to do. "Don't do," actually, is the instruction. So _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samƒÅdhi</a></span>_ automatically is a non-option, because it must involve doing. In the kind of packages that are about being with life, being with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> as <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>, _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samƒÅdhi</a></span>_ seems like it's not being with life - something else happens; life seems to disappear and just become a radiant ball of nice <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>. I'm not, then, being with life. Or in the existentialist schools, they assume "this is what I need to be with, this existential situation." Again, it becomes irrelevant. Or if the view of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> is really what we're doing is releasing, purifying old wounds, old hurts, old karmic knots, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> childhood trauma, then actually _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samƒÅdhi</a></span>_ - those kinds of states - are regarded as escapes, 'spiritual bypassing,' as the phrase goes. That phrase has become so entrenched as to become almost unquestioned as a concept. In that package, the more miserable you are, the better, because that's the real purification. Then you're really with the real stuff<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > Each different focus gives samadhi a different meaning" data-href="Questioning Awakening#Each different focus gives samadhi a different meaning" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-3

All this is there, in big ways and small ways. Couple with that the relationship with goals itself, and the relationship with doing. Some of this we touched on in the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samƒÅdhi</a></span>_ talk as well. I was talking with someone recently. We did a bike ride for DANCE, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> Action Network for Climate <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Activism" data-href="Activism" class="internal-link">Engagement</a></span>, from Exeter - or the bit _I_ did was from Exeter to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a></span>. It's about 20 miles, 30 miles? Something. More? It was a lot. [laughter] It took all day. I was talking with someone about the whole relationship with goals on <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>. And what's the difference between goals on <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> and doing a bike ride like that? It took work. You pedal.

Why is that different than the notion of goals and doing on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>? What's the difference? How does it _become_ different? All this is involved. Predisposition to certain styles. I was talking with someone who said, "I want simplicity." This is absolutely pervasive in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> world, not just the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> tradition. Simplicity becomes so important for us. Why? What's going on there? So there's predisposition, but there are also assumptions and ideologies about simplicity: "An awakened person is a simple person. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">The path</a></span> must be simple. Practice must be simple. Simplicity is where we're going." Why? Where do we get that from? It's predispositions, but ideas, ideologies, underneath, propped up by assumptions that are not usually investigated fully. So the whole dichotomy between 'being' and 'doing' would be another one<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > Predisposition and ideologies about simplicity being and doing" data-href="Questioning Awakening#Predisposition and ideologies about simplicity being and doing" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1

It's interesting, in relation to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>, in the modern Western world, where there's a lot of comfort and safety, generally speaking, in the modern West, deeper levels of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> (if we're talking about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>) are hardly ever tested. They're hardly ever visible. Maybe there are only subtle differences evident between, for example, someone who is really just practising <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> in an ongoing way, just ongoing application of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>.

Of course we want to reduce <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. Everyone is interested in that. But is that _all_ it is?

That's actually not all it is. Is there not, in the way that you feel and relate to practice, a whole kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">mythos</a></span>, a whole kind of ethos, a whole particular kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> that you relate to, that speaks to you, that touches your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>?

And is that not a big part of what we're attracted to, and why we are practising, and why we are here? Each teacher who sits in this spot over a year, or whatever it is, or at other <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> centres, if you listen to them, it's not just a reduction in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that they're teaching, that they're communicating.

So it's interesting. As practitioners, some are really happy with efforting and striving and a sense of goal. It gives them a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nobility" class="internal-link">nobility</a></span>. There's a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="nobility" class="internal-link">nobility</a></span> in that striving. There's a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">mythos</a></span> in the striving. For others, the striving, the effort - one can only find an ego-measurement relationship with it, and it's painful, and it's tight, and it's not authentic. Some practitioners <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, absolutely _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>_ to the core of their being the sense of meditative depth that can open up. They <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> it. They love the subtlety, the refinement of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>. They love the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mystical opening" data-href="Mystical opening" class="internal-link">mystical openings</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> that can occur.

For others, they are completely not interested in any of that - just utterly not interested, and there is more this elevating of the ordinary. Ordinary, everyday - the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">mythos</a></span> of the ordinary. Or the elevating of our existential situation as 'true,' undeniably 'true,' as common sense. "It's common sense, our existential situation," _hiding the fact_ that there is a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">mythos</a></span> wrapped up in that. It's a claim of truth, undeniable fact.

So what do we want? What do _you_ want? I ran through a whole list before very briefly, but let's pick out some of those and unpack them a little bit. This life of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, or presence, or wanting to live life to the full - it's a very popular notion, and not just in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma circles</a></span>. People want to go parachuting before they die, or whatever it is. If you know you're going to die, you go on an exotic holiday. Packing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> - maybe just maximizing pleasurable <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>; maybe just wanting intense <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. Somehow wanting to live life to the full. What does it mean? In these kind of circles, it gets more refined than that. So it's just about the presence, the fullness of presence: "I don't need to go bungee jumping, but I want to live life to the full." How many people think that way and say that way? Do I dare to ask, "Why?" Why do I want to live life to the full? Why? Why do I want to savour the moment, savour the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, the taste, the breeze on the cheek? Why? It seems like the most obvious thing. Do I dare to ask why, and what's underneath wanting that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > What does it mean to live life to the full" data-href="Questioning Awakening#What does it mean to live life to the full" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^6-4

Is it because that's what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> taught, that's what he said? He taught about savouring the moment?

It's not in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a></span>. That's not a thrust of the teaching that's in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a></span> at all.

When we say 'life,' what do we think we mean, or what do we mean? It trips off the tongue so easily: life this, life that. What do we actually mean by it? And what on earth do we mean by living life to the full? Being with life - what we usually mean is being with life _as we <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> it_, and we take that as being 'reality.' There's something about reality assumptions wrapped up here. Something about reality assumptions wrapped up in that whole rhetoric. Is it reality? What we call 'life,' and assume so readily - "I can be with it," etc. - is it really reality? Or is it empty, as the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s teachings would say? They're empty. It's not 'reality' in the sense that we think it is. Just in terms of cultural differences, we modernists, if you like - scientific materialists, secular humanists - we assume, don't we, that we have already or that we _can_ strip off our beliefs, strip off any beliefs and any projections, and approach life and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> 'life' (in inverted commas) as it is. We assume that, way too readily. Is that really the case? We may perhaps assume that if those medieval Europeans weren't forced to believe some church <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dogma" class="internal-link">dogma</a></span>, they would actually see and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> 'life' (in inverted commas) straightly and directly, as we do - purely, without the projection<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > What do we mean when we say life Is it possible to experience it as is" data-href="Questioning Awakening#What do we mean when we say life Is it possible to experience it as is" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-3

Wrapped up here are very popular notions nowadays. Hidden in to the usual way we talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, the usual way we communicate <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> teachings, are a whole bunch of assumptions, a whole bunch of unexplored assumptions about reality. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a></span> and all that, and presence, and being with life, has found its way into the culture too. It's informed the culture, the _Weltanschauung_, the world-view. Probably more importantly, the current world-view, the current modernist world-view, has found its way into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>. It has impregnated the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> with its assumptions and its views. You see it all over the place, all over the place in the movies, in Hollywood, etc. I don't know if any of you saw this twee little movie, _About Time_. {note: "About Time" https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194499/} Did anyone see that? It was quite cute, and a little bit funny. I can't quite remember - it's about a guy. The males in the family can travel in time. They can, I think, go back and do something again. So this guy realizes it, and he does that, and he goes back to when he's made an idiot of himself or he hasn't impressed the girl that he wants to impress. He goes back, and then gets to impress her and stuff like that. He's talking with his dad, who has had this ability for a while. It runs on, and it's funny and cute. But at the end, or towards the end, there's a sort of moral that is given, partly explicitly, and implicitly. The dad kind of says to the son, "Look, it's all great, this ability to do this. But now, actually, I don't do it. The most important thing now is _being with_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, _being with_ actuality as it is, without changing it. Living to the full, living each day as if it's your last. Being in the now, savouring." I can't remember the exact words, but that was in the sort of little moral of it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > Influence of the modern world-view" data-href="Questioning Awakening#Influence of the modern world-view" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-4

Implicit in that, in a slightly confused way, because it was involved with time travel and all that, is this idea that this is reality: "This is reality, and therefore it needs to be respected." But if one realizes that this is _not_ reality, _this_ is not reality - that now_,_ without saying it's something else, this is not reality. Without saying reality is something else, _this_ and _now_ are not. What if one realizes that, in whatever way? It's not reality. Then that whole rhetoric and elevation of _this_ and _now_ collapses. It loses its <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meaningfulness" class="internal-link">meaningfulness</a></span>. It loses its primacy. Its power and its appeal are tied in with, and they come from, hidden <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metaphysics" data-href="Metaphysics" class="internal-link">metaphysical</a></span> assumptions about reality<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > The power and appeal of this and now comes from hidden metaphysical assumptions about reality" data-href="Questioning Awakening#The power and appeal of this and now comes from hidden metaphysical assumptions about reality" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-1

This is an aside: I have to just mention, also in that film, and so often in Hollywood, what's elevated as well as really mattering the most, being the most significant, is human, a close circle of - probably family - <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Human relationship" data-href="Human relationship" class="internal-link">human relationships</a></span>: "This is what matters, especially in the light of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>.

About this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> and presence and living life to the full: could we separate <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> as a simple strategy, as one strategy among many possible strategies? One way. A strategy of dealing with and coping with and responding to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>, thoughts and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span>. And separate that from <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> as a kind of religion - an unconscious religion, a religion that poses as areligious, or assumes it's areligious. And I mean 'religion' in the worst sense of the word here, in terms of being full of unquestioned - in this case, modernist - assumptions, and maybe reductionist materialist, maybe others. Full of unquestioned assumptions about reality. If we don't separate those two, what's a simple strategy (one among many), from what's wrapped up with a whole ideology, it has a lot of consequences for the range and the power and the depth of my investigation, and for the range and power and depth of experiences that open up for me. In both of those (my investigation and my experiences), a lot of what could be very beneficial and very insightful gets circumscribed, gets limited. The range is limited<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > Mindfulness as simple strategy among many rather than a religion" data-href="Questioning Awakening#Mindfulness as simple strategy among many rather than a religion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-3

Let's explore this a little bit: <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> as a kind of coping strategy for the sake of reducing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. Okay? Here's a question. Is that enough, being <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a></span> in order to reduce <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>? Is it enough in the sense of will it reduce enough of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, enough of the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_? Does it go deep enough as a strategy? But even more than that (and I just mention this because I talked about it in other talks; I won't get into it today), is the whole thrust of wanting to reduce <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, the whole tenor and thrust of that, is that enough for us as human beings?

Often this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> or 'being in the now' is seen as a coping strategy, as a way of being in our assumed real, existential predicament: "Things _are_ <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span>. Things _are_ uncertain. Life _is_ uncertain. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Death" class="internal-link">Death</a></span> is coming - that's certain. We're living on shifting sands. The reality of things is just flow. Everything is moving. This is our existential predicament." It's _assumed_ real. So <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> is the way of meeting that, coping with it. Rather than seeing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, then, as being part of a thrust of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> reality, seeing a deeper level of reality, in this case reality is given with common sense. Listen to the words: common sense. Maybe we throw in, "And <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> is a momentary arising process, which is not-so-obvious common sense." But that's about it.

So this opens up a really interesting thing. Some people, some practitioners, they have a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation experience</a></span>, and it therefore becomes a truth. I'll pick one example just because it's very simple and common: "In my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>, the sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> opened out, and was vast and enormous and beautiful and unchanging. Everything else was coming and going within that, and it seemed eternal. Then everything seemed like it _was_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>." They'll say, "It's true." How do you know it's true? "Well, I saw it in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>." Someone else goes, "So what if you saw it in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>? It's just your brain doing weird stuff because <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> is a weird thing and it affects your neurons." One view, another view. Is there an alternative? Or what might be an alternative<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > Example realizing eternal awareness vs its just your brain doing weird stuff" data-href="Questioning Awakening#Example realizing eternal awareness vs it's just your brain doing weird stuff" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^9-2

One possible alternative is actually seeing what happens, exploring the range of perceptual change, in and out of different states of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> how those perceptual shifts dependently arise and dependently cease. That would be _an_ alternative. But what I really want to say here is: look, there's a question here, is there not? How are we going to know, and how are we going to decide, what is real<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > How are we going to know and how are we going to decide what is real" data-href="Questioning Awakening#How are we going to know and how are we going to decide what is real" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^9-3

This isn't abstract, because this affects the whole texture of your sense of existence. The whole sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meaningfulness" class="internal-link">meaningfulness</a></span> in your life, the whole vision and feel of what your life, existence, and practice is depends on what you believe is real and or not, and what's not real. How are we going to know? How are we going to decide? In philosophy, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ontology" class="internal-link">ontology</a></span> is the study of what is real and what is not, and how real, etc. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Ontology" class="internal-link">Ontology</a></span> always comes into it. And <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="epistemology" class="internal-link">epistemology</a></span> in philosophy is the study of how we know things, how we know, for instance, what is real and what is not. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Ontology" class="internal-link">Ontology</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="epistemology" class="internal-link">epistemology</a></span> are part of what in philosophy is called <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="metaphysics" class="internal-link">metaphysics</a></span>, along with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmology</a></span>, which means, "What is this universe that I'm in, and how is it ordered, and what's its structure?" It's impossible to get away from that. You can _think_ you're away from it, you can _assume_ you're away from it. It's impossible to get away from <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ontology" class="internal-link">ontology</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="epistemology" class="internal-link">epistemology</a></span>,<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmology</a></span> - <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="metaphysics" class="internal-link">metaphysics</a></span>. And always we have to assume something. There is always an assumption that ends up being actually unprovable - always. Interesting predicament.

So that whole list before, let's pick out another one: this biological machine. It's rare that you'll get a teacher or someone actually staring you in the face and saying, "You are a biological machine. You are basically evolved over millennia - a very sophisticated, breathtakingly sophisticated neurological machine and biological machine." But sometimes that is underpinning. That view, if you poke at it enough, it's underpinning someone's presentation of what <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> is, etc. "You can learn to reprogram the software of this astonishing computer." Sometimes they'll show you slides of the brain, and how people with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, who do a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> practice, a certain membrane in the brain grows a little bit thicker, or this - I don't know the words - sort of gets a little bit bigger or smaller or this or that. So sometimes even the hardware of your machine can be affected just a little bit. But what we want, or what's possible, is that machine, that biological machine that you are, can be made more efficient. Its neurological functioning can be made more efficient, a more smooth process can ensue, and any unnecessary <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that comes with the hardware before the updated version or whatever can be minimized.

He came up with a way of doing it for himself.

It looks like a kind of machine code thing that you would put in. After a little while he said actually this really helps him. I said, "Okay.

How do you feel about that? Probably some people, "Great, fine. I think I'm going to try it." No phones! [laughter] No phones! And some people will feel somewhat horrified, yeah? Why? Why are you horrified? I don't like it, but that's, again, my bias. But I don't want to distort with my bias. The question is, why are you horrified, or turned off, if you're turned off? Is there not a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmology</a></span>, a sense of what the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> is and what the setting is for our practice, that is woven into our very view of what practice is - the ethos, the feel of it? One of my teachers used to give walking instructions, and they were very vague. It's like, "A <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> walking on the earth." And another teacher I was talking with years later, "He always used to say that. I was like, I don't get what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hell" class="internal-link">hell</a></span> he's talking about." [laughter] And I wanted to ask this second teacher, because _I_ really related to that, I wanted to ask this second teacher, "Okay, so if some machine could be invented that replicated the exact sensations of, say, walking with bare feet on damp Devon grass, exactly replicated but you're actually inside a machine, so the purpose was the same - sharp <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> of sensations - how would that be?" It's fulfilling the same purpose, is it not? Or _is_ it? Because the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmology</a></span> is different, the whole feel for existence, and where we are, and what it means, and what is beautiful, and what is deep - it's different.

So this biological machine is very popular now. It goes back to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Scientific Revolution" class="internal-link">Scientific Revolution</a></span> and the so-called Western <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Enlightenment</a></span> in the seventeenth century, the idea of the universe as machine. Little billiard balls of stuff set in motion somehow, and then mechanically just interacting with each other, ricocheting independent of human observation, and certainly independent of God and all that. Then, in time, you are a machine within this machine. Now you are a computer within a big computer or whatever it is. And it becomes a truth. It becomes a truth. We forget it's a model. It's a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. It's a very helpful model. You see medicine, technology, a lot comes out of that model. But is it a truth? Reductionist <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="materialism" class="internal-link">materialism</a></span>. About 100 years ago, physics - which set the whole thing in motion - started to question, very, very powerfully, pull the rug out from that whole model as a truth. Relativity questioning the objective, independent existence of both space and time, and in quantum mechanics, of the idea of reality being made of little billiard balls, which are independent of the observer, exist at a certain place, in a certain way. And also in Western philosophy, starting around the same time, interestingly, Husserl and people with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenology</a></span>. So this idea that that is a _truth_ - it works, but is it a truth? The idea that it's a truth is actually outdated by at least 100 years. Any <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> that's based on that as truth is actually outdated philosophically and intellectually<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > Western Enlightenment relativity quantum mechanics - the truth" data-href="Questioning Awakening#Western Enlightenment relativity quantum mechanics - the truth" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-1

Then there's this existentialist one I mentioned, where we're sort of cast, thrown into (to borrow a phrase from Heidegger, I think), cast into a meaningless world, usually of matter, of this kind of independent, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulless</a></span> matter.

We're at sea in this, in the fragility, etc. And this is taken as _fact_, as _truth_. And there's only one appropriate and honest response or feeling in relationship to that.

So Blaise Pascal, I can't remember when he lived, but [he was] a mathematician. He also invented the barometer, was a philosopher. "I am terrified," he said. "I am terrified by the eternal silence of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Infinity" data-href="Infinity" class="internal-link">the infinite</a></span> interstellar spaces.

Some people say, "There's nothing transcendent." But in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>, it's possible.

If we go into matter and the physics of matter, and you go deep, deep, deep, what do you get? You get atoms, and then you get electrons, and protons, and neutrons. They're not little billiard balls.

"Well, you can see them in different ways." "But what are they really?" "Well, I don't know. We have an equation." "What's the equation?" "It's a transcendent mathematical entity. It's an abstract mathematical entity." If you know Schr√∂dinger's wave equation - if you have three particles, three electrons, let's say, what's called the wave function, how it actually is, it's an abstract mathematical entity that exists in nine <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span> (three times three).

"We need a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> based in reality." What do you mean by 'reality'? Material? We need a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> based in what is material? Is that what you mean? Do you mean what's tangible, what's "kickable," to quote Samuel Johnson? What's measurable? What's publicly shared? What's socially agreed upon? Is that what you mean by 'reality'? What's secular? What's bound by logic? This is the common notion, that package is the common notion of what we mean by 'reality.' But matter certainly doesn't fulfil all of them, doesn't fulfil even very many of those factors. An electron is not bound by logic. 'A' is not non-'A,' or whatever the thing is. It's not that. It's somehow a superimposition of not being this or that and both. It doesn't fit that. What do we mean by 'reality'? How are we defining 'reality'?

Views and ideas, especially at the level of background, underneath assumptions, are _crucial_. And crucial - again, that word, 'crucial,' is from the Latin _crux_, meaning 'cross.' So a crossroads. The views and ideas we have - if I have this one, I go down that road. It unfolds certain <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. If I have this view and idea, this assumption, it unfolds another one. I go different ways at the crossroads. Crucial. Being with life, being with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, etc., then things like the whole realm of the imagination become irrelevant, a waste of time. You say, "Well, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a></span> doesn't recommend imagination."

Someone was telling me they were having a difficulty. I can't remember what it was. They were struggling a little bit, and a friend said, "Love the five-year-old in you who felt this certain way. Love the five-year-old little girl in you who felt a certain way." And she had done a lot of that. And she just, in that moment, "I just, I've done it. Been there, done it. I can't do it any more. It's done for me. That whole way of thinking and relating is done and it won't work any more." She had had, over quite a lot of years, very rarely, but three or four experiences of a figure that came to her imagination - very, very powerful; at first, oppressive, connected with a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="depression" class="internal-link">depression</a></span>. A figure with skin like a dark black snake, pitch black. She called him the 'black devil man.' It was tied in with her <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="depression" class="internal-link">depression</a></span>, very oppressive at first<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > Story black devil man" data-href="Questioning Awakening#Story black devil man" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-1

Over years, something changed, and actually culminated in a sort of explosively erotic encounter with him. That opened up all kinds of things for her, changed the whole psychological dynamics within her. So instead of going to the five-year-old within, she went and stared into the eyes of this black devil man. She said unbelievable strength and power just suffused her, and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> was gone. It took about two seconds. She was completely surprised by what happened. "Wow," she said. Wrapped up in that - again, let's poke at some assumptions, because we tend to assume, "Well, that black devil man had nothing, no source in her <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span>, wasn't related to anything in her past, some story, some thing that happened - nothing at all." The five-year-old, we tend to think, is more real. There really _is_ this five-year-old, or it relates to the real five-year-old that she was. Or do we consider it being more real? If we <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> the five-year-old feeling this or that, are we assuming that it's a living relic, that she/he is a living relic of my past <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span> and my family? Am I assuming that the way I remember is accurate and true? Do I dare to question this<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > Is the five-ear-old me more real than such a figure" data-href="Questioning Awakening#Is the five-ear-old me more real than such a figure" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^14-2
###### 14-3
We tend to think that five-year-old is related to 'life,' again, and the black devil man is not, is fantastical. What do I mean by 'life'? What's wrapped up about reality assumptions there? People sometimes say to me, "When I was six months old, this happened, and I felt this way, and I've really felt these <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span>. Because of that, I now have these problems." Is that not a theory? I might have experiences that I feel I remember. It _feels_ like a memory of what happened at six years old, and I'm positing that as an interpretation, positing that as a cause for what happened now. Someone else was telling me recently, and I know this from my own <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, working intensely in certain kinds of psychotherapy, and all this stuff is coming up, stuff coming up, stuff coming up - very intense and difficult, and then wondering, "Is it really true stuff?" And the therapist saying, "You've got to hang in there. It's a dark night. You can't run away from it. It's the truth coming up." Or is it the fact that psychological ideas, certain psychological ideas, are stimulating certain experiences? That the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, rather than being real or true, is actually _caused_ by certain ideas<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > What comes up in psychotherapy is it really true stuff" data-href="Questioning Awakening#What comes up in psychotherapy is it really true stuff" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^14-3

So unquestioned ideas - not just, "I am like this. I'm a failure. I'm this kind of character," not just about my story, but about reality, what's real and what's not. About the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmos</a></span>, about the goal of practice, about even things like the role of childhood in the development of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>. Unquestioned ideas operate in us. They operate. Unquestioned ideas will keep delivering the same limited range of experiences, and the same _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>,_ and the same sense of existence, unless they are questioned. They will operate, and they will keep delivering the same range of experiences. Carl <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Carl Gustav Jung" data-href="Carl Gustav Jung" class="internal-link">Jung</a></span> said, "Ideas are not made by persons, but persons by ideas." We don't see how powerful ideas are, because they shape the way we see ourselves and the world and existence, and then that's the existence that we feel ourselves move in. They conjure our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. People want to say, "I'm not into that. My practice is very non-conceptual. I go for non-<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptuality</a></span>." Or it's like, "I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not an intellectual. I don't do all that." Or if they _are_ a little bit intellectual, they'll say, "I don't do <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="metaphysics" class="internal-link">metaphysics</a></span>. I don't do this questioning of what's real, or questioning of how we know anything, or deciding on what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmology</a></span> is." This is dangerous. Always these assumptions are operating. If I think I'm non-conceptual, I am conceptual. If I think I'm not intellectual, ideas are operating. If I think I've put aside <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="metaphysics" class="internal-link">metaphysics</a></span>, it's an illusion<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > Unquestioned ideas operate in us and they will keep delivering the same limited range of experiences unless they are questioned" data-href="Questioning Awakening#Unquestioned ideas operate in us and they will keep delivering the same limited range of experiences unless they are questioned" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-4

To conclude, for today at least, can we expose the ideas and assumptions that are operating for us? And how do we expose those ideas? How will we inquire into whether an idea or an assumption is true? How? And if I find out that it's not true, is it that another one is true? What other ideas are there? What other views of existence, of practice, of path, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>? Is a wholly different relationship with fundamental ideas about reality, about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmology</a></span>, about knowing, all that - is a wholly different relationship with fundamental ideas possible? And can that bring very different <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a></span> and feeling existence? Ideas are powerful, and we don't realize how powerful. They _will_ influence, they do influence, everything. Big ideas can open up the whole sense of existence - the questioning, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, everything. That opening up won't happen just by 'being with,' or just by being with my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span>, if I'm 'being with' with the same unquestioned <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>, unquestioned <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>, etc., unquestioned <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="metaphysics" class="internal-link">metaphysics</a></span>, really.
