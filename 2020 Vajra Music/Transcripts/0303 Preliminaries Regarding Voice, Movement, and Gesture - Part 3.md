I'm not quite sure what will be possible today, but I would like to introduce the fourth exercise, which, as I'll explain when I get to it, could be seen as two exercises. I would like to introduce that, and maybe the fifth one. But before even introducing the fourth, I just thought I'd spend a little time opening up and considering some of the words and the vocabulary we've been using. By now, it's quite familiar to a lot of you who are familiar with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking Dharma</a></span> teachings. Some of these words, and some of these terms - particularly as they inform and inflect and open up our sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>, and our human person, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="personhood" class="internal-link">personhood</a></span>, and what it is to be a person. I just want to say a few things about that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Fourth excercise with two parts but first intro into terminology" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Fourth excercise with two parts but first intro into terminology" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1

A few weeks ago, not very long ago - two or three weeks ago - I was trying to remember the actual details, and I can't remember exactly what it was that I was feeling really quite pressured about, and I'm going to say <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">thrown off centre</a></span>, unbalanced, pressured, flattened. But there were a lot of things that seemed like they needed deciding at the time - practical things, things in relation to preparing for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, and my will, and the future of the teachings, and teacher training, and all kinds of things. A lot of things that needed, seemed to need figuring out and arranging before my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > A few weeks ago I felt thrown off centre" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#A few weeks ago I felt thrown off centre" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2
###### 1-3
Within that, there were, it seemed, lots of different people's requests and opinions and voices in there. I can't remember exactly what it was, but it was to do with those kinds of things, and particularly in relation to the teachings, and the future of the teachings, and teachers, and things like that. But at some point, I realized that, "Yeah, I'm really not feeling okay with all this. This has all gotten a bit crazy." And the language that came to me, or the language that seemed very natural at that point to describe what was missing for myself at that point - and that language [was] also very insightful, but it came very naturally - it was not the language of "I've <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">lost my centre</a></span>," as I said a minute ago, or "I'm uncentered," or "I need to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">get centred</a></span>. I need to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">regain my centre</a></span>, or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centre myself</a></span>," or whatever. That wasn't the language that came. I would understand, of course, those kinds of situations, and that kind of feeling flustered and pulled in so many directions, and so many decisions and all that, that that would very easily be a way that someone, that we in our contemporary society, might describe to ourself what has happened and then what needs to happen<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Ive lost my centre I need to regain my centre" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#I've lost my centre I need to regain my centre" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3

But the words that came, the description that came organically, naturally, spontaneously, and that contained, of course, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, the seeds of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> for what I needed to do to redress the situation was that, "I've lost my connection with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>. I've lost my connection with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="daimon" class="internal-link">daimon</a></span>. And I need to somehow reconnect, find that connection again with the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="daimon" class="internal-link">daimon</a></span>, with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>." And as I said, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> was there. In the description of the problem was the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> of the direction needed for a solution - where I needed to orient, what I needed to do, how I needed to look, how I needed to relate and think about things. And that was exactly what did indeed help: finding again these connections with the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span> in relation to all this, all that was difficult, and what was at the middle, the pith of the difficulty in relation to the teachings, basically, because most of it centred around the teachings and the future of the teachings and all that stuff<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Solution reconnect with the angels" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Solution reconnect with the angels" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4

Finding my connection again, finding again my connection with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, in my relationship with them in relation to the teachings - all of that. That's what had got lost, and I was trying to figure out, solve, find answers to, get through a lot of decisions and things that needed to be made. It all felt quite pressured. But I had lost that connection. I had gone into a much more one-dimensional mode of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> that and relating to all that set of issues and decisions and problems and conundra. It was all one-dimensional. The <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> wasn't there. I wasn't in relationship with the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> with all of that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > I had gone into a much more one-dimensional mode of understanding" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#I had gone into a much more one-dimensional mode of understanding" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1

So when a person today uses language like "I <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">lost my centre</a></span>. I need to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">get centred</a></span> or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centre myself</a></span> or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">find my centre</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">regain my centre</a></span>," what does that word kind of tend to imply, or what's wrapped up in that kind of notion and that kind of vocabulary? Particularly, what's wrapped up, what's it tend to imply about the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>, and about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, and about the person? What's the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>, self, person, that is kind of implicitly tied in with a notion such as '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centring</a></span>'<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Whats the logos of centring" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Whats the logos of centring" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
There are probably quite a few, and it's not set in stone. It may vary, etc. But we could think about a few of them. For instance, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">interiority</a></span> is one of them, generally. Not necessarily, but generally. The <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centre of gravity</a></span>, _my_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centre of gravity</a></span>, and therefore my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of balance</a></span>, my point of balance, is conceived then usually _within_, somehow within me. Here one's feeling perhaps pulled out, so to speak, to all these diverse distractions or pulls or demands or questions or whatever it is, needs, and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centre of gravity</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">still point</a></span>, the balance point, is conceived of as _within_, usually. So there's a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">interiority</a></span> there that's part of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> that goes with words like '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centring</a></span>' and notions like '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centring</a></span>,' perhaps<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Often the centre is conceived something within an interiority Aspect 1" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Often the centre is conceived something within an interiority Aspect 1" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
Secondly, also, is perhaps a notion of circumscription of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>. Like, where do I end? I end here. The world starts there, or you start there, whatever it is. When we talk about a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">Centre</a></span>, we talk about a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> _of_ something, usually. It's a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> of a circle, or a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> of a geometrical structure or whatever it is - a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> of a limited space, a limited area. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">Centre</a></span> of a country, whatever. So there's a delimited space, a circumscribed space. Where I end, that's my boundary, if you like. That's my border<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Centre also relates to the centre of a circumscribed area Aspect 2" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Centre also relates to the centre of a circumscribed area Aspect 2" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 2-5
That notion also seems wrapped up, kind of subtly, implicitly, with the notion of '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centring</a></span>.' Now, I could still have a kind of circumscribed notion of where I end. That could still be involved when I use the language and the idea of connection with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="daimon" class="internal-link">daimon</a></span> or connection with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>. But what I meant and what I mean by that, or what I would like to emphasize right now by that connection with the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, and re-finding that connection with the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, is more a kind of expanded notion or sense of a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>. As we talked about, I think it was in the talk on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Death" data-href="Death" class="internal-link">death and dying</a></span> in _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="In Psyche's Orchard" class="internal-link">In Psyche&#x27;s Orchard</a></span>_, rather than "this area is me," we have a sense of the larger <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> is both <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">image and analogue</a></span>.^["[[ Practising with Death and Dying]]"] There are a couple of parts there: the first part has to do with circumscription, and the second part has to do with singularity. But just to stay with the circumscription: <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">image and analogue</a></span>. I, in my life, am, to the best of my ability, or more or less at different times, the analogue of that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Rather than this area is me we have a sense of the larger human being image and analogue 🟢" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Rather than this area is me we have a sense of the larger human being image and analogue 🟢" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-5
###### 3-1
Where, then, do _I_ end? If I have this more expanded notion of self, I am actually this whole … 'system' is too technical a word, but this whole <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Gestalt psychology" data-href="Gestalt psychology" class="internal-link">gestalt</a></span>, this whole constellation of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">image and analogue</a></span>, or maybe <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images and analogues</a></span>, and that's all me, then where do I end in that? Where is my circumscription in that exactly? And anyway, then, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, because of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">elements of the imaginal</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, where does the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> end? Because that's going to be unfathomable, and have <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfathomability" data-href="Unfathomability" class="internal-link">unfathomable beyonds</a></span>, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Where do I end" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Where do I end" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
[11:42] Where do I draw the line, then, of self there, of my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>? And so where, then, exactly, is the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">Centre</a></span> of it? If I can't draw the line of, the edge of the circle or whatever, I don't know where to place the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span>. I cannot say the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> is here or there. So that's another aspect: <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">interiority</a></span>, circumscription. But also, as I mentioned, singularity. Sometimes, usually, with this notion of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centring</a></span>, there can be a sense of the singularity of self: "I need to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">find my centre</a></span>. I, as a singular self, need to kind of have recourse to my self, find the resource of my, find my resource in my self, in my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span>." And the sense then is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">the self as singular</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Singularity of self Aspect 3" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Singularity of self Aspect 3" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
Now, a person in contemporary society, of course, could say, "I feel terrible. I feel really pressured. I reach out to friends and colleagues or whatever it is," and reaching out horizontally, socially, to the horizontal sense of society and friends, etc. But one could also reach out more plurally, if you like. Not so much just to the singular self, not only reaching out horizontally to the flatly conceived society of others in which I exist, but rather conceiving of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">the self as a plurality</a></span>. So just the fact of conceiving of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>, conceiving of the human person, as I described and tried to really emphasize in that talk on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Death" data-href="Death" class="internal-link">death and dying</a></span>, conceiving of the human person actually, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenologically</a></span>, and when we have a deep sense both of our selves and of another, and when another has a deep <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of our selves</a></span>, that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> is not necessarily completely singular. And I don't mean it's fragmented in the way sometimes <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anatta</a></span> gets taught, but I mean it's plural, or rather, not simply singular in the way that we are both <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">image and analogue</a></span> or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images and analogues</a></span> - several <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, perhaps, and servant to analogue, to that plurality, even, of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > You can reach out horizontally socially but also more plurally" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#You can reach out horizontally socially but also more plurally" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3
###### 3-4
Quite different notions there. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">Interiority</a></span>, circumscription and borders, and singularity are not the sort of default mode of sense of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>, the human person. And they weren't in that case. And I find more and more these days, when things are difficult, when there's challenge different ways, that the sense (and I mean that word in its double meaning: the sense, the actual <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, and the idea) of my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> or another <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> is more along the lines of this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">image and analogue</a></span>, of having <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">angelic dimensions</a></span> which are refracted into the human life more or less at different times, with a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="duty" class="internal-link">duty</a></span> to that. There's a kind of doubleness there, if you like<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > The sense and sensing of being larger having angelic dimensions" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#The sense and sensing of being larger having angelic dimensions" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-4

Introspecting, one then finds one's self at the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span>. Maybe not <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma 101</a></span>, but pretty soon in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, you're going to encounter the idea - and it's not just particular to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Buddhadharma</a></span> - "when I look for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, I can't find it, actually."

So rather than encountering my self at the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">Centre</a></span>, rather than encountering a deep well of still nothingness, wonderful as that might be, actually not at the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span>, but _in relationship with_ a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">theophany</a></span>.

If we linger on this word '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>' a little bit, we've used it quite a lot over the last years, but just to say a few more things about it. Careful, for instance, of a limiting idea that the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> or an <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> or an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> kind of shows up out of the blue and will help you with something, or give you an idea, or give you a creative impulse or whatever it is, a seed or something. It might. It might show up out of the blue. And we talked about - again, I can't remember when, but I used the phrase 'the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">poise of soulmaking</a></span>' or something like that, 'the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking poise</a></span>.'^["[[Pain, as Void and as Sacrament]]""] In other words, taking care of the stance, the poise of one's being, one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a></span>, one's humility and all of that. And in that poise, in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking poise</a></span>, it's sort of opening the space, priming and preparing the space. I'm thinking now of parallels with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Judaism" data-href="Judaism" class="internal-link">Jewish tradition</a></span> of preparing for the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath</a></span>, and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath</a></span> is the reception of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sabbath" data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Shekhinah</a></span>, the reception of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> who visits, who comes on that evening, on that day, and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>'s job is partly to prepare, to make the space and the time beautiful, ready, prepared, holy, special, hospitable<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > More on the word angel 🟢" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#More on the word angel 🟢" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-4
###### 5-1
So it may well be that, with an attitude of humility, we learn to take care with that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking poise</a></span>, and in that way, we are in a kind of humbly waiting and primed or prepared space. Our being becomes that space, becomes a space of hospitality for the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, and they may visit, then, sort of out of the blue. And then, with that, there may be a gift. We may be helped with this or that in our lives, given something - given an idea, given creative seeds, whatever. But careful of that as an idea that might limit our sense of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, and what they are, and how they arise, and what our relationship with them is. Because it's often the case - and this is something I've shared before - that one has already started something. Perhaps it's a creative project, or a big piece of work, and an idea. And perhaps it feels like a lot. It feels like a stretch or a challenge. And the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> comes _then_. And the coming of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> might be the work itself, or this project itself, becoming <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>. _It_ becomes angelic<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > One becomes a space of hospitality of the angels" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#One becomes a space of hospitality of the angels" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1
###### 5-2
It might be there's me, and there's this project, and then there's this third character, called the '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>,' that's going to help me with, in my relationship with the project. But it might also be that the work itself, or the idea that's beginning to take shape, that I'm grappling with, that I'm kind of gestating, or is wanting to come through, whatever it is, or this big project that I need to do, whatever that might be, that _it_ becomes <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>. _It_ becomes angelic. _It_ becomes <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal person</a></span>, with autonomy, with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, its own <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, its own <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Me my project the angel" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Me my project the angel" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2

Careful of, again, not delimiting too tightly what we mean by '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>.' We have to delimit; we're not just open for any old ideas about <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span> and all that business. That's why I said the words, the concepts, are pointing us in a direction, and pointing us along a road, but that road is infinite. It has boundaries. It's not like _anything_ can fall under the scope of that road, and you can just call anything '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>,' which is, in some circles, fairly common. They just use that word too easily, whether it's used completely unspiritually, just as a kind of term of endearment, or in certain spiritual or New Age circles or whatever. And we're _not_ using it in those ways<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > We have to delimit" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#We have to delimit" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-3
###### 5-4
Maybe that's a good analogy: it's like, we're pointing in a certain direction, and then one can just keep travelling in that direction. And the road changes. The road develops. The terrain around the road develops as you walk down that road. But another way of saying this is, an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> is also (like everything) a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span>. In what I was just talking about, we could say, in the first instance, it's dependent on the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">poise of soulmaking</a></span>. The visitation of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sabbath" data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Shekhinah</a></span> on Shabbat is dependent on the reverence and humility, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> for the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sabbath" data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Shekhinah</a></span> and for the divine, and expressing that by the way it takes care of creating the space for the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath</a></span>, in terms of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and house and setting and environment. So of course, all this applies in so many ways to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal work</a></span> and ritual and all that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > The terrain around the road develops as you walk down that road" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#The terrain around the road develops as you walk down that road" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-4

But it's a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span>, an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> is a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span>, also, in possibly another sense, which is, as I said, something is already there.

And it might be that one possibility within that is that the work itself, the task itself, becomes <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>.

Sometimes people say, "Why don't I get <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>?" I don't know. Other reasons that I've elaborated elsewhere aside - so there may well be that actually, for many people, this isn't a relevant reason, what I'm about to say. Maybe there are just other things: they're not relating in the right way to their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> or whatever it is. But sometimes, it's like, actually, if you really, really deeply wanted <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>, they would come.

They would arise, if you really deeply wanted them. So something, sometimes, for some people, the issue is one of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. A person asks, "Why don't I get <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>?", or "They seem to get more. This person seems to get more than I do," or whatever. But it may be that actually it's not something we really deeply want, and so they don't necessarily arise.

We've touched on this before, if you remember; I can't remember where.^[""[[Heat and the Material]]"] They're not living and choosing in their life in ways that really stretch their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> or that open them to kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>-risks, if we might use that phrase. There's nothing really on the line. And they might be stretched in all kinds of ways - might be very busy, might be stretched doing something very helpful in the world, whatever, but it's not actually a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-stretch</a></span>, and there's no real risk there. And maybe it's that the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figures</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">daimons</a></span>, don't need and won't choose someone who is not willing to stretch - stretch themselves, stretch their lives, stretch their <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. So this is also a factor to consider. As I said, it won't be relevant in a lot of instances, but sometimes it is important to realize, "This is actually what's happening," or "This is a reason why something is _not_ happening.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Daimons wont choose someone who is not willing to stretch 🟢" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Daimons won't choose someone who is not willing to stretch 🟢" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^6-4
###### 6-5
It may also be - and again, this will be even in only perhaps some instances of the instances that I've just talked about, where that _is_ the case - it may be that the kind of stretch needed to invite or call forth the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, the kind of stretch to which they respond, maybe it needs to be one which involves or must involve a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="antinomy" class="internal-link">antinomy</a></span>. Remember that word from the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ethics" class="internal-link">ethics</a></span> talks, from "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Sila and Soul" class="internal-link">Sila and Soul</a></span>"" and "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="The Image of Ethics" class="internal-link">The Image of Ethics</a></span>." Antinomies deeply felt in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, and having to choose, faced with that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="antinomy" class="internal-link">antinomy</a></span>, the branches, the roads of their divergent pulls and callings, felt sharply, deeply, genuinely in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. One is almost crucified, pulled this way and that by two opposing values, by the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> of and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="duty" class="internal-link">duty</a></span> of, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="duty" class="internal-link">duty</a></span> to, two antinomical values. And it may be that that kind of stretch, that kind of difficulty, is the kind of stretch that's sometimes - or, I don't know, maybe it's in every case - needed. That's part of what it means to be stretched. It may be just that's a certain kind of stretch; I'm not sure<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Maybe it needs a kind of antinomy to call forth the angels 🟢" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Maybe it needs a kind of antinomy to call forth the angels 🟢" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-5

So all these are things to, I think, ponder. And of course, some people - going back to something I said earlier - well, it might not bother me that much that this sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span> that I hear people talking about or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> don't come to me. And if it doesn't, okay. Leave it. But if it actually _does_, then these are things that you might want to include in your kind of inquiry and self-questioning<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > If it doesnt bother you ok" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#If it doesn't bother you ok" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-1

Then, just briefly, someone was saying something about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking Dharma</a></span> and _da-da-da_, and basically, the upshot was, or one of the pieces was, "Well, I'm sure it's all really great" - I'm very much paraphrasing - "but I don't really relate to the word '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>.'" And this was from a person who had been practising <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> a long, long time. She's a teacher. A long, long time - decades and decades. Which is, you know, probably quite a common reaction, I imagine, not really relating to that word '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>' at all. Oftentimes it's the 'making' that people don't relate to, the word 'making.' Of course, if you understand the whole track of exploration of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> ('<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>' is just another word for 'making'), and how that deepens, and how it opens out, and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> it opens out, then the word 'making' is almost an indispensable word in '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>.' But for a lot of people, it's very puzzling, because you'd usually think of the word '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>,' or have a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, or use that in a very reified way: it wouldn't be something that we _make_. It would be something that _is_, or we discover, or that just is a level of being or whatever<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > A teacher said I dont really relate to the word soul" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#A teacher said I don't really relate to the word 'soul'" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-2
###### 7-3
Anyway, this person, it was the word '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>.' And I thought about that, and know them a little bit. I said, "That's interesting. You've been involved in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhism</a></span> for thirty, forty years or whatever it is. Do you really relate to the word '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregate</a></span>' (<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">khandha</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">skandha</a></span> in Sanskrit)?" Or put the question in the past tense: "Did you really relate to that word when you first heard it, or the words '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>' or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anatta</a></span>, '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">no-self</a></span>,' those kinds of words and concepts?" Probably not. It might be sometimes with words like '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>,' sometimes a sort of predisposition many <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> folk have to that, kind of an intuition, if you like, of that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> and that whole direction and that whole teaching, even before one's really encountered the teaching. But a word like '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregate</a></span>,' it's hard to think that one would really relate to that immediately when one hears it. It might be, but probably not<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Well do you really relate to the word aggregate" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Well do you really relate to the word 'aggregate'" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-3
###### 7-4
What has probably happened instead is one has been trained and trained oneself to use words like '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregate</a></span>' as skilful and helpful concepts, and then perhaps even as <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>. One has been trained in the use of a word like '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregate</a></span>,' or a concept like '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregate</a></span>,' trained to use them and think of them in skilful and helpful ways. They're not <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ultimate truth" data-href="Ultimate truth" class="internal-link">ultimate truths</a></span>. This is something I've said many times. The <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">five aggregates</a></span> is not at all an obvious way of dividing up a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>, and it's hardly, I would suspect, a way of thinking about self that one would have arrived at by oneself, if one wasn't actually handed this teaching: the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">five aggregates</a></span>, and "this is what they are." It was handed to us by someone in a position of authority, with the authority of 2,500 years of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddhism" data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhist tradition</a></span>.

So just the fact that one doesn't really relate to a word that one is not familiar with in itself means nothing much at all. Couldn't the word '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>' be similarly unfamiliar at first, but eventually, with practice and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, actually become, like the word '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregate</a></span>,' very fruitful, like the concept '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregate</a></span>,' and in fact, even be, the word '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>,' the concept '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>,' be something that contributes and supports to the reduction of particular sorts of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, just as the way '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a></span>' does? That's the function of the word '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregate</a></span>.' As I said, it's not an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ultimate truth" class="internal-link">ultimate truth</a></span>.

And couldn't '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>' be just something similar? Unfamiliar at first, but with training, with practice, as <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> grows, it becomes very fruitful as a term of vocabulary and a concept, and fruitful in many ways, but in one particular way: in reducing certain kinds of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. The word '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregate</a></span>' will not, on its own, authentically and finally reduce the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">suffering of soullessness</a></span>, for example. Again, if we open up, "What does that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Four Noble Truths" data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">First Noble Truth</a></span> mean? What kinds of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> are there, and therefore what does the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Four Noble Truths" data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Third Noble Truth</a></span> mean, ending <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>?", we could say these days there is the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">suffering of soullessness</a></span> in our society, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">in our culture</a></span>. The <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in part of that is a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of meaninglessness. We could bag it all together as the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">suffering of soullessness</a></span>. It's also to do with lack of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> and aesthetics, and lack of depth, refusal of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span> - all kinds of things<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > The dukkha of soullessness" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#The dukkha of soullessness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-2
###### 8-3
But the word '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregate</a></span>,' on its own, will not finally, fully, and authentically reduce _that_ kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">suffering of soullessness</a></span>. In fact, it might even _support_ it. The <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">suffering of soullessness</a></span> may be worsened by the teachings on the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a></span> if I'm not careful how I pick them up, and if or when I put them down. We could choose other words as well, even words from our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">contemporary culture</a></span>, not from Buddhist culture, like 'trauma.' It's an idea. Actually, it's a whole <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>. Nowadays, when we speak psychologically, and we draw on that word and we use that term, we're actually invoking and implying a whole <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span> of psychology there. You can say, "I don't really relate to that." In other times, other cultures, other periods of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span>, it would have been a quite bizarre notion, or even just the sort of broader notion of, say, for instance, parenting experiences shape the psychology, or are a dominant factor in the shaping of later psychology. Again, there's a whole <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>. Actually, there are _many_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a></span>, many alternate <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a></span>, which overlap, that we're invoking when we even say words that point to that whole idea and that whole framework of ideas. So it could be really, really helpful, but we may not relate to it at first. It may be very, very useful, these words borrowed from psychology, and these psychological concepts and notions<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Words from other conceptual frameworks might turn out to be useful like words from psychology" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Words from other conceptual frameworks might turn out to be useful like words from psychology" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-3

Or even when we use the word 'brain.'

They had their word for it. I've forgotten what the Pali is. They looked at corpses and dissected them and whatever. But the way we use the word 'brain' now, or the way many people <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">in our culture</a></span> use the word 'brain' now, as synonymous with '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>,' definitely was not at all how the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> meant the word 'brain' or '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>,' as being something that was necessarily primarily physical, even, or certainly not completely physical<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Or words like brain" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Or words like 'brain'" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-4

So there are lots of words and concepts. "This time in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span>, in culture, or at this time in my evolution and my practice and my journey, I don't really relate to this word, '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>.'" It's like, so what? It doesn't mean that it cannot then be, become, with training, a very useful, very fruitful, very freeing idea, word, term of vocabulary, and concept. Back to that word, '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a></span>,' even if it's just picked up as a kind of notion, without much skill in using it as a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> in terms of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anatta</a></span>, etc., as I would kind of outline that direction of practice, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā practice</a></span>, it still functions to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricate</a></span> less. As a term of vocabulary, it <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricates</a></span> less <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. It certainly <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricates</a></span> less self-sense. It dissects and kind of undercuts self-construction, self-<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. It might do that at all different levels, let's say, depending on how much skill one has in actually practising with that notion<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Like aggregates soul can be a word I can relate to skillfully over time" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Like 'aggregates' 'soul' can be a word I can relate to skillfully over time" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-1

But as a term, it's what it does, is it moves in the direction, it stimulates the direction of less <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and of self, or of some sufferings and of some levels of self, let's say. In so doing just that, in this movement towards <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricating</a></span> less self, at the same time, the other side of the coin is that therefore it doesn't honour and respect and keep in focus or keep in the sense the person. Again, the person as someone in relationship, in meaningful relationship, that gets lost. The minute we start emphasizing talk of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a></span> and a view of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a></span>, then we simultaneously lose sight of, lose sense of, the richness and multidimensionality of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="personhood" class="internal-link">personhood</a></span>, and the relationality of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="personhood" class="internal-link">personhood</a></span>. Again, I'm going back to that talk - I'm pretty sure it was the one on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Death" data-href="Death" class="internal-link">death and dying</a></span> - sort of thinking, what could we use this word, 'person,' to mean, perhaps, when we're talking about a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human subject</a></span>, a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> that's more than subject, because they're in meaningful relationship, and so they're more than just self?

So they're kind of divergent directions or modes: the notion of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a></span>, or the notion of, let's say, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > But the notion of the aggregates and the notion of soul are divergent directions when making sense of a person" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#But the notion of the aggregates and the notion of soul are divergent directions when making sense of a person" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-2

Later on, in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vajrayana" data-href="Vajrayana" class="internal-link">Vajrayāna</a></span> teachings, there's the possibility of seeing the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">five aggregates</a></span>, as divine, as holy. But even then, we actually lose the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="personhood" class="internal-link">personhood</a></span> of the person. It dimensionalizes in a different way. Each <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregate</a></span>, depending on different tantras, each <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregate</a></span> is associated with a different <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>, a different <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dakini" data-href="Dakini" class="internal-link">consort</a></span>, or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dakini" data-href="Dakini" class="internal-link">ḍākinī</a></span> or whatever. There's a wonderful kind of dimensionalizing and divinizing, divination that can come through that, but it still misses the person. Beautiful range of practices, yet it still misses the person. So the term '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a></span>' and the term '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>' almost instigate mutually exclusive, opposite movements, almost<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Even Vajrayana with seeing the aggregates as holy misses the person" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Even Vajrayana with seeing the aggregates as holy misses the person" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-3

Just asking the question in a field of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span> can stimulate a further opening of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span>, or we begin to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sensing the other as angel" data-href="Sensing the other as angel" class="internal-link">perceive other as angel</a></span>.

They also imply, going back to something I said earlier today, neither a simple singularity nor a simple doubleness. If I'm seeing this person as <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, I'm seeing them as <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">neither simply single, nor double</a></span>: "They are usual Tom, Dick, or Harry, and Tom, Dick, or Harry's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> or whatever." There's a mystery in the kind of impossibility of finally dividing them up as one or two, this being that I'm encountering, this being that I'm <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span>. But all these words, when we use words like '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>,' or '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>,' or 'my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>,' or any time we talk about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, there's that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="unfathomability" class="internal-link">unfathomability</a></span> there. And there's this '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">neither one nor two</a></span>,' _really_, _simply_, as well as, implied in the words '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>,' '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>,' or '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>,' etc., the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Infinity" data-href="Infinity" class="internal-link">the infinite</a></span> echoing and mirroring. So that infinite echoing and mirroring is of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> into this person's life, and this person's life and this person's being as <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Infinity" data-href="Infinity" class="internal-link">the infinite</a></span> echoing and mirroring of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> also a mirror and an echo of the being, in a kind of two-way, back-and-forth echoing and mirroring each other. The mystery of that kind of sense and notion is also wrapped up in the sense of '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>' and '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>,' as of course is also the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">neither real nor not real</a></span>, the theatre-like quality<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Words like angel soul image imply unfathomability" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Words like 'angel' 'soul' 'image' imply unfathomability" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-1
###### 10-2
So when we use these words, '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>,' '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>,' just like '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>,' all this is wrapped up there. And also <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eternality" class="internal-link">eternality</a></span>. The angelic dimension is the timeless dimension. I perceive this person as <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, perceive an <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, just an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, or the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> that I'm in relationship to, or the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, etc.; implied is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eternality" class="internal-link">eternality</a></span>. So the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, as we said, I think, in that talk on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Death" data-href="Death" class="internal-link">death and dying</a></span> (I think it was that one), <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> is not of space or time. The being of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, the dimension of the being of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, is not of space. It's not located inside me, or next to me, or behind me, or wherever, above me, below me, but nor is it located in time. It's refracted, this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>. He/she/they are refracted into space and time. And there's a sense, too, of participation - that the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> is something, if we talk, again, going back to the examples I gave of needing to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">reconnect with the angels</a></span>, there's also a sense of re-participating in something, or reconnecting with my sense of participating in something, and the mystery of that word<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Angel is not of space or time" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Angel is not of space or time" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-2
###### 10-3
So when we use these words, all these other words, all these other notions, are kind of woven into the meaning of these words. They've become really rich words, '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>,' '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>,' just like '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>.' And again, similar to the analogy I said about these words are like roads: they point in a certain direction, but that road goes on forever. It's another way of saying all these words and concepts and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>, especially like '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>' and '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>,' they have soft and elastic edges. Actually, all those words, like 'participation' and '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>' and '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eternality" class="internal-link">eternality</a></span>,' all of them: soft and elastic edges. And they will stretch. So our notion of what we're talking about when we say '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>' and '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>,' that will stretch over time.

Soft and elastic edges. They will stretch.

Okay, so let's introduce - let's call it the fourth exercise. We might consider it two exercises, so the fourth and the fifth, or set of exercises; I don't know. This one is in fact a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a></span> exercise, or these two are <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a></span> exercises.

[59:49, **exercise four, part one + variations** begins] ^11-2
###### 11-3
If we take it as two exercises, the first part - if you say it's two exercises, two parts, of one exercise in two parts - the first part in a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a></span>, and setting that up, whatever it needs to set that up, in terms of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="temenos" class="internal-link">temenos</a></span>, in terms of the space, in terms of the presence. In the first part, really, one person in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a></span> blesses the other, and the other person receives the other's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>. So one is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>, and one is receiving. We've done quite a bit of this in different ways in the past, but I just want to add a few more pieces in there, a few more variations as well. So some of it will be familiar, and some will be maybe less so<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Excercise 4 1 One person blesses the other person receives the blessing" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Excercise 4 1 One person blesses the other person receives the blessing" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-3
###### 11-4
**(4.1)** One person, it's their turn, and they bless the other. They bless them through <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, and voice</a></span>. But what you cannot do as the blesser is you cannot use any known language, any language known to human beings. You can utter sounds, you can use your voice, but not any known language. Somehow you're conveying <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> and emanating <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>, expressing and manifesting <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>. So one thing here is, what does that _mean_, that word, '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>'? And again, back to what we just said about these words - soft and elastic edges, and it will grow, and it will deepen. The meaning of the word '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>' may already be very wide, or it may not. It may start as, "Well, I'm not really even sure what it means exactly.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > 🟡 Excercise 4 1 1 no known language for blessing" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#🟡 Excercise 4 1 1 no known language for blessing" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^11-4
###### 11-5
But it is potentially wide, deep, and multidimensional, and open, and elastic, soft and elastic. So that, as we practise more, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span> and especially in relation to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> and being blessed, we can hopefully create and discover more and more of what '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>' might mean. It might start, for instance, as just <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>: "I'm not really sure about that word, '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>,' but I know what <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> means, and I'm familiar with that." It might just start as that. Okay. Let it start as that. Maybe it includes praise, what they call - 'doxology' is the fancy word. Words of praise. Doxo-logy. Or, in this case, movements, gestures, and vocalizations of praise. So maybe that's a slight expansion from just the notion of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. It starts expanding. Maybe it includes that. Maybe it includes also <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="gratitude" class="internal-link">gratitude</a></span> - that in one's praise, there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="gratitude" class="internal-link">gratitude</a></span> wrapped up in it. I remember - again, I can't remember what talk it was from, but that word, Eucharist, actually means 'thankfulness' or '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="gratitude" class="internal-link">gratitude</a></span>,' I think, in Greek.^[Burbea, [[Pain, as Void and as Sacrament]]] ^11-5

It may be, as I said, either within this exercise, or as we repeat the exercise, or as we generally just do more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking practice</a></span>, and our sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span> grows, and the range of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> and ideation grows, it may be that this whole notion grows, of what it means to bless, and what it means to be blessed. And in the exercise, it might be that as we're doing the exercise, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, the sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, the sense of the other, and the sense of the world, the environment, maybe even time or whatever, all that can become <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. Maybe if I'm trying to use my voice without language, and trying to say, trying to bless, but without language, it might be that the sounds, the words, or maybe not even words, but the sounds uttered and heard become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>.

So just in terms of the exercise, then, maybe you're in a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a></span>. You're facing each other. One person takes the first turn to be the blesser. The job of the other is the one who is blessed. Their job, their task, is twofold. It really has to do with just silent sensitivity and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a></span>. They want to notice. They're looking at and listening to and opening their <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a></span>. We've done all this kind of thing before. You open the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a></span>, and all the senses open to the other and their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>, and their movement and voice and gesture. Open to the sound and the visuals and all the senses, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a></span> in relationship with, sensing with the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a></span>. But then sensitive to one's own experiences, one's own experiences as the one who is blessed, and one's own experiences of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>. And that includes whatever <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>, whatever <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-resonances</a></span>, etc., <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">arise and pass</a></span> within that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > The blessed one is not responding but is sensitive with the energy body" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#The blessed one is not responding but is sensitive with the energy body" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-1
###### 12-2
So for the one who is blessed, it's a task in sensitivity, and opening the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and the senses to that really full relationship with the one who is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>. And then tracking, noticing what happens, primarily in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>, as this person blesses you. One wants to establish that, a really good <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and emotional sensitivity and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. And then, on top of that, when that's ready - probably that needs to be there before one then opens it up to including any <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span> or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a></span> of the whole relational field there, and the whole <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of being blessed, the other, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, the moment, all of it. But practically speaking, or at least from the outside, so to speak, one is just silent and still and open, and the task is one of sensitivity in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, in the emotion, and then in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a></span>. One is not responding<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Include sensing with soul the whole relational field" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Include sensing with soul the whole relational field" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-2

And then, maybe after ten minutes - well, you can time it yourself. Ten minutes might feel like a lot, doing something like this. It may be that this is really quite difficult, that some people find this really quite difficult. They're a bit sort of baffled or stumped what to do, how to do this at all. But hopefully it can also be fun. A few variations to throw in, but yeah, let's say after about ten minutes, you can reverse roles, and maybe you need some <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">silent meditation</a></span> or something in between, perhaps, to gather, or maybe not. You'll have to see. Ten minutes, as I said, may feel very long. It may feel very difficult and awkward, and one isn't quite sure what to do and what sounds to make, etc. Or it may be that actually it needs ten minutes, or it needs longer, to get going, to get into a kind of groove, because it's unfamiliar. For some people, it may not be at all. But either way, even if it's difficult, hopefully it can be fun as well. Lots to discover there as an exercise<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Change after probably max 10 minutes depending on how awkward it is" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Change after probably max 10 minutes depending on how awkward it is" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-3

So if you're in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> role, then you can improvise your utterances. Improvise what comes through your mouth. Take your time. It may be very fast - there's a very fast flow - or a very slow flow. It may be there are pauses in between utterances or movements or gestures, or that it's just continuous streams. Or maybe a continuous stream, then a pause or whatever. It may be loud or soft. See if you can let your sense of any <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span> that's there, any sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, let that sense guide you, just as we use that as a guide in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Blessing variations" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Blessing variations" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-4

So you want to be feeling, sensing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, the resonances in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>. You want to be putting, as you're <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>, your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a></span> in relationship with the other. It may be that you deliberately bring in or play with the deliberate introduction of an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of yourself, that you inhabit a certain <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, perhaps that you're familiar with, or certainly that's arising at the time, or an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of the other, a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span> of the other, or of the space you're in or, as I said, of the movements and gestures and utterances themselves - that you bring in deliberate <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>, a deliberate <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal sense</a></span> of what they are. It may be that there's an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> that you bring in that's a third, so that this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a></span> is somehow coming or, if you like, in touch with you, and through you, they are <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> the other, but it's really coming from this. So there are all kinds of possibilities here. For some people, this is going to be really quite strange, and may take a little getting used to. It may feel a little awkward; others, maybe not at all, and it's just easeful and delightful and fun<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Feel resonances in the soul and the energy body maybe bring in deliberate imaginal sense" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Feel resonances in the soul and the energy body maybe bring in deliberate imaginal sense" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-5

**(4.2)** Then a few variations, okay? One is (4.1), the only rule is 'no words.' You can make any movement or any gesture or any vocalization. So any <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture</a></span>, or vocalization is okay, but not words, as I said. No language. A second possibility (4.2) is no words and also no vocalizations. So you can only use movement and gesture, no voice. Still, how do you bless just through movement and gesture? What wants to come? What feels <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a></span> there? Can I sense that, be in relationship, and follow that thread<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > 🟡 Excercise 4 1 2 no vocalizations" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#🟡 Excercise 4 1 2 no vocalizations" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^13-1
###### 13-2
**(4.3)** And a third possibility is no words, but no movements or gestures either - only vocalizations. Okay? So you've got (4.1) movements, gestures, vocalizations, all okay. Then you've got (4.2) only movement and gesture is okay. And then you've got (4.3) only vocalization is okay. So three variations<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > 🟡 Excercise 4 1 3 only vocalizations" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#🟡 Excercise 4 1 3 only vocalizations" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-2

Sometimes it might occur to you to sing a melody if you're allowed to vocalize. That's fine. Maybe that's part of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>. You hum or sing something, and it's part of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>. If you do do that, make sure that sometimes you try it without singing a melody, without singing anything. Again, we're interested in really opening up ranges here<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Treat singing as not vocalizing but then also try not singing" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Treat singing as not vocalizing but then also try not singing" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-3
###### 13-4
Okay, now, either the second part, or a separate exercise - we could conceive of them either way. You could separate this exercise number four into two separate exercises and do them at different times, or you can kind of just segue one part into the next<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > 🟡 Excercise 4 2 2nd part" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#🟡 Excercise 4 2 2nd part" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-4

The second part, or the second exercise, would be then the same thing, but dropping any idea of an attempt to express or convey some meaning - in other words, something that one _could_ say in words. Even <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> may be something that one could, aspects of it could translate into words. Maybe it's just a second part. You're taking it to another level, really, dropping any idea of an attempt to express or convey any meaning, something that _could_ get put into words, or an emotion. You're not conveying or expressing an emotion, or an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, or an event, or a story, or my story, or your story, or whatever it is. There's just <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, and voice</a></span>. And dropping any sense of an attempt to express something with that, to convey something that _means_ anything with that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Drop any idea of an attempt to express some meaning" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Drop any idea of an attempt to express some meaning" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-6

Remember, we have the element of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meaningfulness" class="internal-link">meaningfulness</a></span>,' and this also 'not reduced to a single meaning.' So what happens, then, if we recognize <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> is more than this or that meaning? Even if the meanings are important, even if the meanings are important to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> is _more_ than that meaning, than any meaning. And <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> is also more than heart. So what happens now? Perhaps, then, also the notion of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> may get kind of altered or dropped. Does that make sense as an exercise? [shuffles papers] I'll just see if there's anything else I want to say about that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Soul is more than any meaning" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Soul is more than any meaning" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-7
###### 13-8
In what happens in that second part, then we could say maybe we've gone beyond <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> in the usual sense. It's an interesting word, '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>,' and I think it sort of occupies an area that's at the edge of what could be put into other words. But in a way, in the second part of this exercise, we're just encouraging what we're doing through movement and gesture and voice to extend beyond the notion of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> in the usual sense, because we're trying to drop any attempt at expressing or conveying any meaning or anything that could be put into words<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Blessing is already at the edge of meaning and Part 2 goes beyond even that" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Blessing is already at the edge of meaning and Part 2 goes beyond even that" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-8

I think that's it. Hopefully that's clear for that exercise. I think we'll stop for today there, and add the fifth exercise at a different time. Hopefully that's enough to be going with, and that makes sense, and you can play with that. As I said, it might feel very awkward. It might feel very, very strange for some people, and maybe not at all for others, everything in between. It might feel difficult. You might feel very <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-conscious</a></span>. All kinds of things. But it might also be fun. Wherever it starts, it can grow. It might start, even, it feels all very nice, and maybe you're used to it from different <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span> that we've done to some extent, but then even from where it is there, it can grow and deepen and complexify and become a lot more subtle as well, and involve a lot more sensitivity, both on the part of the one who blesses, and the part of the one who is blessed<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > It might feel awkward but it can grow and deepen" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#It might feel awkward but it can grow and deepen" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-2
###### 14-3
Maybe in the second part of this exercise, we're even talking about something that's beyond the notion of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>, in the way that we usually use that word anyway. There's just an exercise, or there is just a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a></span>, using <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement/gesture/voice</a></span> with the purpose of, the intention towards, deepening sensitivity, extending range, and being receptive to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, receptive to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> and a vehicle for <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, a vehicle of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. And all that - that sensitivity, and that opening up of where we can sense <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, and how <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> can express through us, and what we can recognize as <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> - all that becomes the main point, and it has an extraordinary range of subtlety that's possible there, and sensitivity, and growth, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span>. That's a big part - range and depth, sensitivity and including subtlety. Of course, it doesn't have to be subtle only, but it can move into that territory more and more. So that's what this is for. That's the purpose of this. That's the invitation<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Recognising soul is the main point" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Recognising soul is the main point" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-3
