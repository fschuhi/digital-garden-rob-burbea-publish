Sometimes we have a very different sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perfection" class="internal-link">perfection</a></span>, our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perfection" class="internal-link">perfection</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perfection" class="internal-link">perfection</a></span> of being, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perfection" class="internal-link">perfection</a></span> that runs through being, existence. Washing my hands â€¦ so bony now. I've lost so much weight. Feeling my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> wasted away, just bones really. I can't see properly. I can't stand up. I don't have any balance. Washing my hands after going to the toilet, trying to be careful because of the virus. And somehow, in the touch of one hand on the other, in the touch, there's some kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perfection" class="internal-link">perfection</a></span>. There's some kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> of God's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">grace</a></span> that has nothing to do with '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perfection" class="internal-link">perfection</a></span>' in the way that we usually understand it or think of it, _becoming_ perfect<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perfection and Christs Blessing > A very different sense of perfection" data-href="Perfection and Christ's Blessing#A very different sense of perfection" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1

It's a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of seeing</a></span>. It's very personal. I mean, it's universal _and_ it's personal. Somehow <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, in there, somehow being known in there, and knowing. All of this, it's wrapped up in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perfection" class="internal-link">perfection</a></span>, or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perfection" class="internal-link">perfection</a></span> wraps it up, permeates through, shoots through it. It exudes it. It expresses it. Similarly, feeling so bad, feeling so weak and tired - I've lost almost all the capacities - somehow <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">Jesus</a></span>'s <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> is on everything. I don't know what that means. What does it mean? I don't know. The heart, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">the heart and the soul</a></span> _knows_ something, feels something, senses something, opens to something, realizes something. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">Jesus</a></span>'s <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> is on everything, and that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> is a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perfection" class="internal-link">perfection</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perfection and Christs Blessing > Jesuss blessing is on everything" data-href="Perfection and Christ's Blessing#Jesus's blessing is on everything" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2

It's the opposite. It's in exactly not the accumulation of wonderful capacities, but the stripping away - the loss, the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, the misery, incapacity. This word in theology, '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Christianity" data-href="Christianity" class="internal-link">theodicy</a></span>,' it's like, trying to explain how the occurrence of difficult, bad, even evil things, is congruent or makes sense with a good God. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Christianity" data-href="Christianity" class="internal-link">Theodicy</a></span>. All these different theories and perspectives. Maybe it's something to do with - _more_ we need to rely on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span>. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> senses something. Something opens. We glimpse something. We taste something. The heart knows something. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">The heart and the soul</a></span> know something. We see it. We feel it. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">Jesus</a></span>'s <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> is on everything. Christ's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> is on everything, _in_ everything - in the _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ itself, right there in the palpable _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perfection and Christs Blessing > Theodicy" data-href="Perfection and Christ's Blessing#Theodicy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3
