Sometimes we have a very different sense of [[perfection]], our perfection, the perfection of being, the perfection that runs through being, existence. Washing my hands â€¦ so bony now. I've lost so much weight. Feeling my body wasted away, just bones really. I can't see properly. I can't stand up. I don't have any balance. Washing my hands after going to the toilet, trying to be careful because of the virus. And somehow, in the touch of one hand on the other, in the touch, there's some kind of perfection. There's some kind of [[beauty]] of God's [[Devotion|grace]] that has nothing to do with 'perfection' in the way that we usually understand it or think of it, _becoming_ perfect. ^1-1

It's a [[Ways of Looking|way of seeing]]. It's very personal. I mean, it's universal _and_ it's personal. Somehow [[love]], in there, somehow being known in there, and knowing. All of this, it's wrapped up in [[perfection]], or perfection wraps it up, permeates through, shoots through it. It exudes it. It expresses it. Similarly, feeling so bad, feeling so weak and tired - I've lost almost all the capacities - somehow [[Jesus]]'s [[blessing]] is on everything. I don't know what that means. What does it mean? I don't know. The heart, [[Soul|the heart and the soul]] _knows_ something, feels something, senses something, opens to something, realizes something. Jesus's blessing is on everything, and that blessing is a perfection. ^1-2

It's the opposite. It's in exactly not the accumulation of wonderful capacities, but the stripping away - the loss, the _[[dukkha]]_, the misery, incapacity. This word in theology, '[[Christianity|theodicy]],' it's like, trying to explain how the occurrence of difficult, bad, even evil things, is congruent or makes sense with a good God. Theodicy. All these different theories and perspectives. Maybe it's something to do with - _more_ we need to rely on [[Soul|sensing with soul]]. The soul senses something. Something opens. We glimpse something. We taste something. The heart knows something. The heart and the soul know something. We see it. We feel it. [[Jesus]]'s [[blessing]] is on everything. Christ's blessing is on everything, _in_ everything - in the _dukkha_ itself, right there in the palpable _dukkha_. ^1-3
