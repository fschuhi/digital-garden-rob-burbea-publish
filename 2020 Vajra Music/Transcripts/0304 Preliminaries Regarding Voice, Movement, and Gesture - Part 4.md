###### 1-1
Before I introduce exercise five, or a fifth set of exercises, I'd like to say a bit more about exercise four, a few more things there, and add a possible variation for exercise four. Let's say a few things. Given the instructions for exercise four in the first part, with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>, it would be quite normal, perhaps, and certainly understandable, to sort of hear that, hear those instructions, and think - even if it's not a sort of very drawn-out, discursive thinking, but something like think in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, "Okay, what does <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> look like? Or what does <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> sound like? What would that look like as a movement or gesture, or what would it sound like?" So there's a kind of process that's instigated by the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, maybe by past associations with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>, if we have any (because <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">in our culture</a></span> it's not a word that's in common currency any more, that has much currency outside of certain narrowing circles)<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > The question what does blessing look like is culturally contingent Mode 1" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#The question what does blessing look like is culturally contingent Mode 1" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1
###### 1-2
But maybe we think, "What does <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> look like?", and we draw upon past associations from here or there or whatever. So perhaps putting the hands on the head - in some traditions, that's part of how one blesses. One places one's hands on someone's head, and utters a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>, confers a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>. Or in other traditions, one sometimes marks a cross, a crucifix, a small crucifix on the forehead of the one blessed. Or just gestures in the air, marking the crucifix. All these very beautiful gestures from other traditions. Or I might think, "What does <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> look like?", and it occurs to me there's a bowing involved. That would be a very understandable connection to have made, association to have. Or the hands in _namaste_, in prayer pose, pressed together. Or, for instance, the hands and the palms tracing over the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, or even larger than the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> of the one blessed, and sort of conveying, conferring the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> through the hands, over and into that space, penetrating the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> field, the being, with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> through the hands and through that tracing of that movement<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Blessing in different traditions" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Blessing in different traditions" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2
###### 1-3
So in thinking, so to speak, if we use that word, 'thinking,' "This is what <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> looks like or sounds like," out of that thinking and those associations, etc., comes the movement, the gesture, and/or the vocalization. All that's really great. And in a way, I think when we've done rituals and ceremonies on past <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span>, for example, and included these kinds of instructions with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Blessing" data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">blessings</a></span>, etc., that this is part of what's gone on for people, and it's wonderful, and it's beautiful, and it can be very, very powerful. But it's possible, or just to open up the recognition or the possibility at times, also, of the propulsion and the instigation of the whole <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement or gesture or vocalization</a></span> not so much coming from an idea. Not so much an idea leading to an action, an idea of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>, an idea of what <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> looks like, or associations, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Out of a traditional idea come particular movements gestures vocalizations" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Out of a traditional idea come particular movements gestures vocalizations" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3
###### 2-1
So yes, that has its place, but just to invite, to open up a space for a possibility of a slightly different way of entering into this intention, that's starting, for instance, instead, just with the intention of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> - even if I'm not quite sure, as I said in the last talk, what that actually means for me. Let it be an open word. Go with what I've got. Let the word itself be a seed. Who knows what will germinate, what will sprout from that seed? Just start with the intention of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>, and just start moving, gesturing, vocalizing, whatever it is, depending on which part of the exercise you're doing and the instructions. So there's the intention, even if it's not quite clear what that exactly means, that word, '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>,' for instance. And just start moving, with the intention. Just start moving, and almost like with the incorporating the feedback, so to speak, from the movements, from the gestures, from the vocalizations that you're doing. So sensing, as you're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">moving/gesturing/vocalizing</a></span>, sensing: does this feel <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a></span>? If I do this, does it feel _more_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a></span>? If I do that, does it feel _less_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a></span>? So just as we do with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking practice</a></span>, a part of one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> is very attentive, refined, careful <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> on the sense of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span> in the moment, and what is supporting that, and what is not supporting that; where it opens and blossoms and grows and deepens, and where it shuts down a bit or gets a bit flat or narrow<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > But the word blessing can also be a seed which can be blossom intosoulful direction Mode 2" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#But the word blessing can also be a seed which can be blossom intosoulful direction Mode 2" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
So it could be the sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span>. It could, again, be the sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>, or both, of course. What you're really doing is you're just starting with an intention, and just starting moving with that intention. And whatever actions you're doing, whatever <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movements/gestures/vocalizations</a></span> you're doing, you're almost receptive to, attuned to, how that feels in line with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>. So letting the movement/gesture/vocalization shape the action in time, as it goes, playing it by ear, so to speak, or creating the pottery, whatever you're making on the potter's wheel. Creating it as you're going, through the feel of it, through the feedback you're getting, through the signals of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> and of blessedness and blessingness that are coming back to you. Slightly different than starting with an idea, and then kind of replicating that idea, and perhaps then not putting so much <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> on what feels <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a></span>, what doesn't feel <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Just start with an intention and just start moving with that intention" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Just start with an intention and just start moving with that intention" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
They're both good, but I just really want to open up that space for that possibility, that second possibility. If we do it that second way, or if at least some of the time we're in that second mode, then a couple of things: one is, what helps me be in that mode? It's quite difficult. It's actually quite difficult to dance, for example, and really be sensitive to the sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, in terms of the genuine, authentic <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, and all the elements, and all that sensitivity. It's actually quite difficult to do. So what would support it? One thing - it may or may not be; you'll have to find out - do I need to slow down? Do I need to slow the whole movements down, for instance, or pause in between movements, or what? What's the kind of rhythm that allows me to read, to sense, to be attuned and receptive to the sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span> in the moment, and whether it's being opened and supported or closed and not supported, the sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > What helps to be in Mode 2" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#What helps to be in Mode 2" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
So what pace do I need to go at? It's just like doing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">walking meditation</a></span>, doing _any_ kind of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">walking meditation</a></span>. There's always this question: what pace should I walk at that, right now, most helps whatever <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> I'm trying to do, whatever <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> I'm engaging in that walking posture? So one is a question of pacing. It might be slowing it down. It might not be. I don't necessarily assume it is. But sometimes going slower allows us, affords us, a greater sensitivity, a greater attunement and a greater reading of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span> and the sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, the sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> that's there. So that's one thing that may be important<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Its just like doing walking meditation pacing" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#It's just like doing walking meditation pacing" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 3-1
A second may just be - and this goes for so much, of course - to the degree that we're judging ourselves in the moment, that will usually, almost always, shut down my sensitivity, my capacity to notice the sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span> and blessingness in the moment. By conventional behaviour in our society, all this is pretty strange, some of these exercises, and this one in particular may be very strange. And then you're doing it in a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a></span>, so there are all kinds of reasons it would be quite normal and expected for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of judgment or self-judgment to arise: "Oh, it's silly," or whatever it is. "It looks silly. I'm not getting it. I'm not doing it very well," whatever it is. Is it possible to just let that go? Is it possible? It's a question. I'll come back to that, actually, a little bit later. But to the degree that there's judging there, self-judging there and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of judgment from another, to that degree it shuts down our sensitivity, generally speaking, but also in this particular exercise, and the kinds of sensitivity we need in this particular exercise<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Is it possible to let go of oh its silly" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Is it possible to let go of oh it's silly" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
[10:53] But this second way of doing it, we're sort of just focusing on the intention, planting the intention, letting the intention instigate and lead our actions - even if the intention is not fully comprehended by us: "What does <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> mean? What does it mean to bless someone? I don't know, maybe, or I only know a little bit," or whatever it is. But in this second way of doing it, or second leaning, let's say, second emphasis, then we're letting that intention lead us, and just starting the movement, and kind of reading it, surfing the whole situation, responding with our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a></span>, with our sensitivity, responding to what we sense in terms of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span> and the blessingness, and letting that shape the movements, the gestures, the vocalizations we're doing. So we're letting the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and the sense of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span> in the moment guide the movements, the gestures, the vocalizations - at times, at least. Seeing if it's possible to lean into _that_ mode more, sometimes at least, more than the other mode, which is almost like a preconception, an idea, a notion, a memory, an association of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> and what it looks like or sounds like, an idea of what movements, gestures, and vocalizations convey <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>. So both good, both fruitful, but see if you can sometimes get a sense of moving between those different modes, or at least between those two different emphases, let's say, because it might not be so black and white<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Leaning into Mode 2" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Leaning into Mode 2" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
As I said, this is quite a strange exercise from the perspective of conventional <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understandings</a></span>, and the way we conventionally understand what the voice is, etc., and how we use the voice, for example, or how we communicate. Usually, of course, we use the voice, and we think of the voice as an instrument, a vehicle, through which, by which, we share or communicate something. And that usually implies describing something. Through our voice, we share, communicate, and thus describe what I'm feeling, or my story, or something that happened, or an idea, or an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, or whatever it is. That's usually the way we relate to how we use the voice, and what the voice is: we're communicating something through trying to describe it, to represent it, re-present it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > We usually use voice to communicate something" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#We usually use voice to communicate something" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3
###### 3-4
And even, often, sometimes when we're doing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mantra practice" class="internal-link">mantra practice</a></span>, or we introduce a chanting, and we kind of hear - okay, this is the mantra, we learn the melody and the syllables or whatever, and a part of us is thinking, "Okay, what does it mean?" Or if not "What does it mean?", "What's the character of this mantra? Whose mantra is it? Which deity does it belong to? Ah, it's (for example) <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Avalokiteśvara</a></span>." Then I know. Then I know it's invoking <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, because it's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Avalokiteśvara</a></span>. So in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mantra Practice" data-href="Mantra Practice" class="internal-link">chanting of the mantra</a></span>, or the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mantra Practice" data-href="Mantra Practice" class="internal-link">reciting of the mantra</a></span> or whatever, I'm invoking, I'm thinking - I'm obviously concentrating on the sound, etc., and the voice, but I'm invoking the meaning of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, even if those syllables, I don't know what they mean. And some of them don't actually mean anything. They're <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="seed syllables" class="internal-link">seed syllables</a></span> that don't have meanings. Others are kind of seed meanings as well in different mantras. But anyway, oftentimes we as Westerners will want to know, "Well, who am I invoking?", so that when I'm chanting the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Om mani padme hum" data-href="Om mani padme hum" class="internal-link">Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ</a></span>,_ and it's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Avalokiteśvara</a></span> or whatever, "Ah, yes, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Okay." And part of me is thinking about the meaning of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Again, I don't mean a lot of discursive thought, but I mean the whole vibe of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and I realize, "That's what this mantra means.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Mantras also dont necessarily have particular meaning either" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Mantras also don't necessarily have particular meaning either" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^3-4
###### 4-1
Now, of course, that's not _wrong_. It's not wrong at all for a mantra, and it wouldn't be wrong for the first part of this exercise, exercise four, where the intention _is_ towards <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>, and letting that word, '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>,' be soft and elastic and expandable. But what if the sound itself, as sound, was sensed with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>? Not to do with its meaning. This is where the second part of the exercise comes in. It may be there already, coming through, and predominating even at times, in the first part of the exercise where there _is_ the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>. So some sound itself, sensed with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. We're moving towards a jungle of sounds, a landscape of vocalizations - mysterious, because not necessarily meaning anything, or at least, not _just_ meaning anything<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > What if the sound itself was sensed with soul" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#What if the sound itself was sensed with soul" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-1
###### 4-2
I've said this before. I've mentioned it several times. I don't know how much it's landed, because again, I've been too quick, too brief in going through it. But the voice itself, my voice now, is trying to convey certain meanings, and there's a logical path through what I'm saying, and each sentence is structured grammatically, syntactically, and all that. But at the same time, there's a level of the sounds that you're hearing that transcends meaning. Yes, there's the meaning there, and hopefully you're listening for the meaning, and you're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> it, so you can apply it in the exercises, etc., and understand <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> and all that stuff. But there's also a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> here. There's also just the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span> of the sound, the mystery, the ineffable mystery of the sounds themselves, the sounds right now of my voice. And there's an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfathomability" data-href="Unfathomability" class="internal-link">unfathomable mystery</a></span> in that, _if_ it's sensed with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, if I can sense it with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. It opens up other <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span>, but it opens up also a whole other direction of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > There is a level of the sounds of my voice that transcends meaning" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#There is a level of the sounds of my voice that transcends meaning" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-2
###### 4-3
So the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span> of any kind of verbal utterance can be through the meaning. For instance, when we convey something, and it's beautiful or poetic, or we convey an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, or even convey our life story, or something that happened, or how we're feeling, or an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, in the meaning of what we're conveying, we can convey mystery: the mystery of what we're conveying, the mystery of our being, the mystery of being in general, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="unfathomability" class="internal-link">unfathomability</a></span> of it - for example, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="unfathomability" class="internal-link">unfathomability</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. All that's conveyed when we share an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> and the person gets the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, or starts resonating with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Dimensionality comes from both meaning and mystery" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Dimensionality comes from both meaning and mystery" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-3

So the person listening, also, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span> of what is heard, of the sounds that are heard, open up through meaning, but also _not_ through meaning, through just sounds themselves, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span> of the sounds themselves. Now, as I said, there can be there both at the same time, if we enter a certain mode of listening and mode of speaking. So right now, for instance. The meaning of this and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span>, or the meaning of this and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span> of what's opened up through the meaning of what's being said in my voice, but also the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span> that are opened up just through the sound, through the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> of it, the mystery of it, the miracle of hearing and of sound. This particular sound, right now. This particular <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span>. Different than other musics.

###### 5-1
So both can be there at the same time, depending on both how one is speaking, but also how one is listening, whether we are <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span>, of course. In this exercise, especially in the second part of this exercise, we really want to emphasize - really in both parts, because we're not using verbal sounds; yes, we're not using traditionally understood verbal sounds, or verbal sounds as traditionally understood in the first part of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>, but there's still meaning there. But in this exercise, especially in the second part, we really want to emphasize that second direction of opening up <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span>, beyond meaning, just in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span> of the sounds themselves, in the mystery of that, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mantra Practice" data-href="Mantra Practice" class="internal-link">incantation</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mantra Practice" data-href="Mantra Practice" class="internal-link">invocation</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mantra Practice" data-href="Mantra Practice" class="internal-link">spell-making</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > In 4 1 x there is still meaning in 4 2 we are opening up dimensionality and go beyond meaning" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#In 4 1 x there is still meaning in 4 2 we are opening up dimensionality and go beyond meaning" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1

In terms of instructions, for this exercise, number four, for the witness, the person who's just silently watching, sensing with all their senses, and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a></span>, remember, and listening and looking at the person <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> or the person <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">moving/gesturing/vocalizing</a></span>, in a way, the exercise there, or the emphasis of the exercise, is really just on noticing. I think we demonstrated this at the beginning, if I remember, of that - I've forgotten what it was called now - "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Voice, Movement, and the Possibilities of Soul" class="internal-link">Voice, Movement, and the Possibilities of Soul</a></span>" or something like that. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Catherine McGee" data-href="Catherine McGee" class="internal-link">Catherine</a></span> and I demonstrated as a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a></span>, and I asked her to move. She made very, very subtle movements, very subtle. In fact, almost none. She hardly did anything apart from blink a few times, if I remember. But if I'm open enough, and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span> in relationship, sensing with the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a></span> (we talked about this several times), bringing the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a></span> into sensual relationship there (without touching, in this case), then even the blinking of an eye, I'm going to notice that that has an effect in my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, even in my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">emotional body</a></span>, and in my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. Actually, any movement, any gesture, any vocalization will affect the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and, let's say, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>. But we're talking now very, very subtle. If it's a very subtle movement, it might be very subtle. Of course, it might be very, very strong. It depends on all kinds of things, of course<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Witness is just noticing albeit by bringing the whole energy body into sensual relationship 🟢" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Witness is just noticing albeit by bringing the whole energy body into sensual relationship 🟢" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2
###### 5-3
But there's no pressure for the witness for it to be this or that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. Really I'm just noticing: what are the effects I notice in my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and in the field with these movements, gestures, vocalizations, pauses, silences, all the rest of it? Just noticing. It doesn't have to be _this_ or _that_. For the witness, so to speak, for that person in that role, it becomes really an exercise in relational sensitivity, and that's the emphasis. For the person who's moving or gesturing or vocalizing, it may be that one is really quite baffled by these instructions, or it goes along okay, and then one becomes just completely stumped, or a bit at a loss of what to do, or how to move, or what to vocalize, etc. So again, it would be very understandable, very normal, and completely okay<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Just noticing - it doesnt have to be this or that" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Just noticing - it doesn't have to be this or that" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-3
###### 5-4
If that happens, one way of responding to that is just pause. Just stop, and just sense - sense <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, sense the other, sense the space that you're in, sense the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, sense what's going on emotionally, and just be with that sense. And out of that sensing in the pause, without pressure, then maybe - _allowing_ yourself to pause; in other words, not feeling like, "I have to keep doing something. I have to keep producing some kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement or gesture or vocalization</a></span>." Allowing yourself to stop, pause, and sense, and taking the pressure off that way, but remaining attentive and connected and alive and attuned to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">experience of self, other, world</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">emotional body</a></span>. And then, perhaps, out of that, out of that sensitivity and attunement in the pause comes the instigation, the seed of the next movement or gesture or [vocalization]<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > In case of feeling uncomfortable the blesser is allowing themselves to pause sense the space theyre in Method 1" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#In case of feeling uncomfortable the blesser is allowing themselves to pause sense the space they're in Method 1" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-4
###### 6-1
So that would be one response. Another is kind of the opposite or complementary, which is: don't stop. Okay, so I'm baffled and stumped, and a bit at a loss what to do, but just see if you can keep moving or gesturing. And as I said before, let the material - in other words, the movement, the gesture, the voice - still be there. The material is still there. You're not taking your hands off the clay on the potter's wheel. You're not taking your hands off the piano. You keep moving them on the piano. And there's making sounds as you move them, and you're responding to the sounds that you hear, and to how they make you feel, and your sense of them<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Just keep going Method 2" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Just keep going Method 2" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-1
###### 6-2
So rather than stopping the vocalization, the gesture, or the movement, you actually just keep going. Don't stop. Don't let the bafflement or stumpedness or confusion stop you. Just keep going. But sense as you're doing so, and see if you can follow what feels in any way <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a></span>. Again, like on the piano, as I'm bashing away, and I'm confused: "I don't know, I'm not a piano player. What am I doing? I don't know. But when I do _this_, I press these ones down there, for example, in the low register, I press them, very soft - ooh, yeah, okay." Very soft and quiet in the low register, and it's kind of dissonant. Okay, well, that creates something, and I can kind of feel a certain mood with that, and there's a little something moving in my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body and soul</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Also for Method 2 sense what youre doing" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Also for Method 2 sense what you're doing" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-2
###### 6-3
And then it occurs to me, just out of that very sensitivity, that something, little darts of notes high up on the high end of the piano will complement that, and so I do that. I'm not a piano player. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just responding to the feel, but I don't stop the flow of the material. In the piano analogy, I don't stop the flow of the sounds which come from the movement of my fingers hitting the keys, and in this exercise, 'the flow of the material' means I don't stop <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">moving, gesturing, and vocalizing</a></span>. But I'm just tuning in and sensing as it rolls along, as there's this flow of the material, and I follow, as best as I can, what feels in any way <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a></span>. So like I said before, I'm letting the material shape the creation, rather than the sort of pause in the inner sense and silence, and then a sort of creation _ex nihilo_ sort of thing, or this kind of preconceived notion or idea of what it looks like, whatever I'm trying to do<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Im just tuning in and sensing as it rolls along and I follow soulfully" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#I'm just tuning in and sensing as it rolls along and I follow soulfully" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-3
###### 6-4
As I mentioned, it would be quite normal for <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-consciousness</a></span> to arise for the person <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">moving, gesturing, and vocalizing</a></span>. And it might be all kinds of things, variations on that: <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of looking silly, of sounding silly, of seeming silly, of being thought of as silly; a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of being blocked, and then being judged as blocked, or just judging oneself as being blocked. It could be all kinds of things. Again, so much depends on background and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span> and conditioning and upbringing and all that stuff, as well as many other things - personality and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-style</a></span>. But it might be that we even _expect_ that. Just expect <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-consciousness</a></span> and awkwardness and a little bit of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of judgment, etc., to come up. Maybe it's good to just expect that, and to include it. So include it as an expectation, but also include it if it comes up. And sometimes it may not need very much. We just keep going, and it's included just through <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, okay? The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> expands to include that: "Oh, okay. There's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-consciousness</a></span> going on as well. There's a bit of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span>, or even a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span> about looking silly or whatever it is, or sounding silly." Can there be a bit more space in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>? Because <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span> will contract the space of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. Sometimes just creating a bit more space can help<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > There might be self-consciousness arising" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#There might be self-consciousness arising" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-4
###### 7-1
<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">Self-consciousness</a></span> can arise and, in the very <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of what we mean by '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-consciousness</a></span>' in that sense, it's a kind of unskilful <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>. Not a sort of skilful and careful and caring examination or inquiry or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-experience</a></span>, but a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span>, almost like an obsessive <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> that's out of balance and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">contracted</a></span>. So that opening up the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> - for instance, to more sound, to the space of the room that you're in (especially if it's a large room), to the sky, etc. - just that opening out of more space for the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, for the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, counteracts the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> that's inherent, really, in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-consciousness</a></span>, in that kind of afflictive <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-consciousness</a></span>. And that also tends to be intrinsic to states of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span> as well. So sometimes just opening out the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> - continuing the practice, what we're doing here, working with the dyads, but just opening out the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>. Still aware of the other, still aware of what one is doing, and movements, gestures, and the whole resonances of all of that, the vocalizations, aware of self, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, all of that, aware of other, but all that in a larger space. Just that movement, that opening out of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to include more, to cover a broader space, to encompass and open to a broader space, can be really helpful as one continues with the practice<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Opening up counteracts the contraction thats inherent in self-consciousness" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Opening up counteracts the contraction that's inherent in self-consciousness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-1
###### 7-2
And of course, again, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of judgment from others, or self-judgment, etc., how important are the qualities of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>? So as always with these kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a></span> exercises, we've talked about this before, but to stress it again: it can be so helpful as part of setting up the space, the field, setting up the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a></span>, setting up the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="temenos" class="internal-link">temenos</a></span>. We include, either deliberately and formally - or rather, formally, we include a specific _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice. And that can be just a few seconds, or a few minutes, or longer, whatever. We can set that up at the beginning. Or, as we said - we've been through all this before when we talked about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="temenos" class="internal-link">temenos</a></span> - sometimes you're with a person, and you can rest assured that there's [_<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_] there; I don't have to re-stress it. But setting it up in the beginning, if certain exercises or situations are likely to trigger <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-consciousness</a></span>, self-<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of judgment, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of self-judgment, inner critic, all that. Taking care to actually put a little more emphasis and spend a little more time setting up the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="temenos" class="internal-link">temenos</a></span> at the beginning, or rather the aspects of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> within the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="temenos" class="internal-link">temenos</a></span>, can be really, really useful<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Set up the temenos in the beginning and include metta" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Set up the temenos in the beginning and include metta" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-2
###### 7-3
And that _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> can also be something that we introduce. Just pause: "Something's happening. It's getting in the way. I feel blocked here. There's a lot of judgment or a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of judgment or whatever it is." And just pause that, pause the exercise, and you can voice that. Then there is an actual articulation of something to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dyad" data-href="Dyad" class="internal-link">dyad partner</a></span>. Or not voice it. It could be silent, and one's just, "Okay, let's just spend a bit of time with _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>," and not necessarily telling the other what I'm doing right then, but just in that pause, however long it is, moving into a _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice. I would suggest _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> for oneself, certainly, because that's where the affliction is, but also for the other. And maybe even, again, a sense of a larger space, the space that you're in, imbued with _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, a field of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> in which you are both sitting. So all these are possibilities if or when <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-consciousness</a></span> arises<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Also add metta in an adhoc fassion to counteract self-consciousness" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Also add metta in an adhoc fassion to counteract self-consciousness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-3
###### 7-4
And then, to just briefly touch on or offer a few other possibilities, it may be, too, that there's something accessible, or a sense accessible, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> accessible, in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a></span> at that time, of oneself, of the other, of the space that you're in, of the whole environment, the world, that they can be sensed with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. Some <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of sensing something or other with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> in all that, in all that configuration may be really helpful. So that may have perhaps started to happen, perhaps earlier in the exercise, and you can bring it back more deliberately, or lean on it a bit more. Because when there's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span>, it will tend to counter that kind of reified and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">contracted</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-consciousness</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-obsession</a></span>, because that's not really a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-movement</a></span>. It may be a kind of squeezed, impoverished reflection of what's, if you like, originally a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-movement</a></span>, but in itself, it's not. So when we sense with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, something opens that out<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Sensing anything with soul also counters the contracted self-consciousness" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Sensing anything with soul also counters the contracted self-consciousness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-4

There are all kinds of possibilities, but really to expect it, to include it, this possibility of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-consciousness</a></span> and the affliction of that. You don't have to fight it.

What does that mean? Well, it's an open statement what that means to your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, what that means in that situation. Of course it's sort of connected to what I just said about the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span>. One can deliberately draw on or reignite a certain <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span>, a certain <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal sense</a></span> of what's happening, that places this very <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-consciousness</a></span> and the problem of that in the sight of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, in the holding of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, in the lap of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, and see what that does<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Place the affliction in the sight of the angels" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Place the affliction in the sight of the angels" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-1

One can also, for instance, just recognize one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Fullness of intention" class="internal-link">Fullness of intention</a></span>, or reignite one's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Fullness of intention" class="internal-link">Fullness of intention</a></span> as one of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">elements of the imaginal</a></span>. "Why am I doing this? What's the primary intention? Is it to look good, to impress? Is it just simply to avoid being judged, or to avoid looking silly or whatever?" Of course, no one's going to start an exercise like this, a dyadic exercise like this, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, with that limited intention, but very easily and without our recognizing it, our intention can slip. In a fraction of a moment, or just gradually, it can slip so that what started, perhaps, as a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Fullness of intention" class="internal-link">Fullness of intention</a></span> toward everything that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> beckons us to open to and move towards, what can start as that ends up shrunken to an intention (again, without our realizing it, and quite easily) of just trying to get through the exercise, just trying to get through the time, make it through the time, with a minimum of looking silly, or judgment, being judged<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Re-ignite ones fullness of intention" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Re-ignite one's fullness of intention" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-2

So again, it's not to judge that slipping from a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Fullness of intention" class="internal-link">Fullness of intention</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Fullness of intention" class="internal-link">Fullness of intention</a></span> is, as I've said many times, quite rare. It's rare for that element to really be there in its fullness. We're just reminding ourselves and recognizing that capacity of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, that inclination of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, in fact, that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> that _wants_ to have a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Fullness of intention" class="internal-link">Fullness of intention</a></span>. It's already there as a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-desire</a></span>.

In a way, that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> for <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, is the most primary <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. It's already there, and it's a matter of just re-cognizing it, recognizing it, reminding ourselves of it, reaccessing it as opposed to judging that it's not there at that moment. It's a difficult one, but it's also the most fundamental one, interestingly<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Re-cognize the eros for soulmaking" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Re-cognize the eros for soulmaking" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-3

And just at another level, kind of less <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a></span>, if you like, but just remind yourself, recognize the fact: this is an exercise, an exercise and a practice. It's not a performance. I'm not performing for the other. I'm not performing for myself or the teacher or the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sangha" data-href="Sangha" class="internal-link">Saṅgha</a></span> or whatever it is. It's an exercise and a practice, and that means it doesn't have to be perfect. One of my very first teachers said to me, "If everything was perfect, why would you need to practise?" It's an exercise, a practice, and an exploration. So all kinds of things are going to happen, and I'm not going to get it totally right and be amazing and dazzling all the time, or even very much of the time. It's an exercise. So all kinds of possibilities if or when <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-consciousness</a></span> arises in that kind of afflictive way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Remind yourself Its an excercise not a performance" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Remind yourself It's an excercise not a performance" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-4

What can happen as we do this, exercise number four, or many of these exercises with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement/gesture/voice</a></span>, is that something in the larger constellation, the larger configuration of what is present, what is unfolding, something in that larger constellation may, at some point, ignite and become <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. So it could be a kind of general <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sense of divinity</a></span> - that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span> is present in all of it, or in some elements of it, shining through it, being refracted through some or all of the components, the constituents of what's happening at any time. It may be that the movement, the gesture, the voice themselves become <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>. We sense them with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. It may be the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>. It may be the sense of even something like tradition. You might feel like, "Well, what tradition is this? I've never done anything like this, sort of nonsense syllables and improvised movements that don't have any meaning, that look potentially very silly probably to most people. What tradition is _that_?" Well, I don't know, but it doesn't matter. There may still be an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal sense</a></span> of tapping into and being in the stream of some kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> tradition. That could be a tradition _of_ the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, or just an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> tradition, some esoteric practice of sacramentalizing, making holy<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Something in the larger constellation may ignite and become image" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Something in the larger constellation may ignite and become image" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-1
###### 9-2
And as things become <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, or _if_ things become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, a reminder: none of them need to be very clear and well-defined in order to be an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal image</a></span> with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> power. I'm [not] exactly clear what my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of the tradition is, or if I had to describe the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, maybe it's hard to describe. Maybe it's not so vivid, not so well-defined. But it can still - I've said this so many times in talks over the last few years - it can still have tremendous <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> power without being clearly defined and perceived on a sensorial level. It can be fully, authentically <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, it can be a fully <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal image</a></span>, without being necessarily clear or well-defined. It could be an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of the other. It could be an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of the space we're in. Where are we when we're doing this, when this is happening? Or, if you like, the time that we're in - that there's a sense of even just fragments or moments in this exercise of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> and the being blessed, of moving and gesturing and vocalizing in a way that's beyond meaning, there's a sense of even moments of that could be reflecting something that is always already happening. We are playing something out. We are analogues of an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> that is always already happening in hierophanic time<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > It can be a fully imaginal image without being necessarily clear or well-defined" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#It can be a fully imaginal image without being necessarily clear or well-defined" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-2
###### 9-3
And, as always, when something ignites, some constituent of the larger constellation, configuration, becomes <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, just like with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">elements of the imaginal</a></span>, when one of them ignites, then it's possible that the whole then ignites, and the whole thing is then perceived at a whole other level of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span>, with a whole other level of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span>, sense of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> there. So that's one of the possibilities of what may happen here, in different directions<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > When one constitutent of the larger constellation ignitates then its possible that the whole then ignites" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#When one constitutent of the larger constellation ignitates then it's possible that the whole then ignites" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-3
###### 9-4
(**variation on exercise four** begins) ^9-4
###### 9-5
Now, I said I wanted to introduce a variation for this, exercise number four. And in a way, it's kind of related to what I've just said, but it's a deliberate move, rather than something that might just occur spontaneously. That variation, that possibility, is that it still remains a dyadic exercise, an exercise in a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a></span>, but your <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dyad" data-href="Dyad" class="internal-link">dyad partner</a></span> is actually a so-called 'intrapsychic' <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. In other words, you're not doing this with another actual, physical <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>. You're doing this in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dyad" data-href="Dyad" class="internal-link">dyadic relationship</a></span> with an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. Same thing though: you take your turn to move the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and make gestures and vocalize to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, to your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> who is your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dyad" data-href="Dyad" class="internal-link">dyad partner</a></span>, to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> there, to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a></span>. And then you receive, in your imagination, the movements, the gestures, the vocalizations, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> and just the mystery of that communication from the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, in your imagination<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Rather than actual person dyad partner is intrapsychic image" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Rather than actual person dyad partner is intrapsychic image" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-5
###### 10-1
In the first of those two and its two possibilities, when it's _your_ turn to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">move/gesture/vocalize</a></span> to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, again, like in other exercises, it could be that that is physically concretized - in other words, someone else looking on, a third person looking on could see you move, see your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a></span> move and gesture, and hear you, or it could be just in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal sense</a></span>, in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">image-sense</a></span>, in the imagination. Okay? So there's a whole other variation for this one, which is in an, if you like, purely <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal dyad</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Move gesture vocalize physically concretized or just in the energy body" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Move gesture vocalize physically concretized or just in the energy body" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-1
###### 10-2
[45:50, **variation on** **exercise four** ends] ^10-2
###### 10-3
Why? Well, there are a few reasons for opening up that variation, or suggesting that variation at times. One is, in relation to what we said before, that it may be that doing it on our own, especially if we're on our own in a room somewhere, that we're actually less <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-conscious</a></span>. If that's an issue, if that comes up, as it might for some people, actually just doing it on one's own, in the privacy of one's own <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> space, just with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a></span>, there's less chance of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-consciousness</a></span> arising because we're less under, or we _feel_ ourselves less under the scrutiny of another <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Less chance of self-consciousness arising if we do it with an imaginal dyad partner Reason 1" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Less chance of self-consciousness arising if we do it with an imaginal dyad partner Reason 1" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-3
###### 10-4
But secondly, there's also a possibility - not necessary, but a possibility - that in doing it with an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a></span> as your <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dyad" data-href="Dyad" class="internal-link">dyad partner</a></span>, that the whole thing can actually become more subtle. It's almost like because, perhaps, we're in relationship with a more subtle entity (an <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a></span>), our movements, gestures, and vocalizations can be allowed to become correspondingly subtle. We're less pulled into the gross. There's a related reason, a third reason, related to that, opening up the possibility of allowing the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movements/gestures/vocalizations</a></span> to become more subtle, which I've said many times: in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking practice</a></span>, but also in other practices, oftentimes the movement into depth is a movement into more subtlety. So we really want to keep that range of things, the more subtle range, open, and keep exploring it - not at the exclusion of the grosser, but just a reminder that sometimes the more subtle is actually the more powerful and the more fertile and the more profound<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Also the practice can become more subtle Reason 2" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Also the practice can become more subtle Reason 2" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-4
###### 10-5
Tied in, there might be a third reason for doing it this way sometimes, doing it intrapsychically, so to speak. It's that it may allow the movements, gestures, and vocalizations to be more unusual, stranger, in the sense that whatever we're doing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">in moving, in gesturing, in vocalizing</a></span>, it no longer has to look or sound so much like praising or anything recognizable at all. It may be, at least, that some of the pressure that may be constraining <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movements/gestures/vocalizations</a></span>, and also <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span>, gets removed by removing the physically present other. It may be. For other times, or with other people, it'll work the other way: the actual presence of a physical <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> with all their <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span> allows something, allows what comes through me and what I allow myself to do, it allows that to have _more_ range, both in subtlety and in the unusualness of what I'm doing<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Can increase the range of what were doing Reason 3" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Can increase the range of what we're doing Reason 3" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-5
###### 10-6
But do it both ways. Play both ways: with an actual <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>, a physically present <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>, and with an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">intrapsychic image</a></span>. It may be there are a few reasons why this helps, just doing it with an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a></span>, not with a physically present human. A fourth reason why, I'm just going to touch on this briefly and say: it may be that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> needs some things that are, so to speak, only between me and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>. They're secrets. They're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-secrets</a></span>. They're treasures and precious confidences between me and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, and _only_ between me and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, only between you and your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>. And it might be, as much as the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> needs to realize its <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> and its <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span> in relationship with '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Materialism" data-href="Materialism" class="internal-link">material reality</a></span>,' if you like, or physical beings, actual human beings, and again, the whole range and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span> of what that means - <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Materialism" data-href="Materialism" class="internal-link">materiality</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span>, and human beings - as much as that's the case as a support and a foundation and the field for a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, it may still be that the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> still, at times, needs some things that are only between me and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, only between you and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Some soul-secrets might be for the ears of the angel only Reason 4" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Some soul-secrets might be for the ears of the angel only Reason 4" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-6

So there's a variation there of this, exercise number four. And remember, if you _are_ doing it, particularly if you're doing it with [an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">intrapsychic imaginal figure</a></span>], this may be more likely - I'm not sure whether to call it a '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a></span>' or 'far enemy,' but certainly a deviation, a perversion a little bit from the intention of the practice - whether it's more likely to come up if we're doing it without a physical <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> present, in a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a></span> with just the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, if it's more likely (I'm not sure) for it to come up: remember, we're not here seeking information. If the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, is gesturing and moving in my imagination, or vocalizing towards me, in that communication, in that sharing (in the very broad senses of those words), I'm not seeking information. That is not my primary intention, by far<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Remember we are not seeking information" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Remember we are not seeking information" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-1

That kind of thing may occur at times, but it's not equivalent to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> - knowing the future, or this or that happens, or something psychic, or whatever like that. It may occur at times, sure. It may occur. But it's not the same thing as <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, and it's not the primary intention. Usually when the intention goes into that kind of thing, that's when I'm seeking information; usually that information is for the sake of a reified self, and what this self can get, or how it can aggrandize itself in some way. And then, what we referred to before, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Fullness of intention" class="internal-link">Fullness of intention</a></span> has slipped at that point, or it hasn't been allowed to supersede that other, narrower intention for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>: "What can _I_ get here?" The issues of power and, as I said, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-aggrandizement</a></span> come in. When there's the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Fullness of intention" class="internal-link">Fullness of intention</a></span>, those other intentions get pacified and they get hugely superseded. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Fullness of intention" class="internal-link">Fullness of intention</a></span> is a much more powerful, much more primal, fundamental, beautiful, sacred intention than these other intentions that are more to do with a reified self, and power, and what it can get, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Magick is not soulmaking" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Magick is not soulmaking" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-2

Okay. So that's exercise four, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a></span> exercise with two - well, two main variations in terms of whether we do it with an actual <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>, with a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> partner, or with an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a></span>, an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, and also the variations to do with whether it's intentionally <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span> or just moving completely beyond communicating any meaning, and also the variations of which aspects of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, and voice</a></span>, of those three, which combinations of those are included jand allowed at different times.

(**exercise five** begins) ^11-4
###### 11-5
**(5.1)** Okay, so exercise five, again, it might be viewed as a series of exercises. I'm not really sure quite what to call it. I'm not sure it needs a name. But in a way, it's really thinking about kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">iconic moments</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">iconic movements</a></span> and gestures, and entering into them: movements, gestures, moments that can become iconic for us, that can themselves become <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, or have for a culture, at different times, themselves or for sub-cultures, become iconic. The exercise is to take one of these moments and embody it. Feel into the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a></span> of that moment, and then let your <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and your voice and your gesture and movement embody it. Let the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a></span> really get a sense. And then see what comes. In a way, this might sound, "Okay, that's a bit easier." But the level that I want to talk about it at is perhaps a little more unusual, perhaps even a little bit stranger than some of the other stuff<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Iconic movements and gestures" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Iconic movements and gestures" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-5
###### 12-1
So the first one we might call - again, very tentative with names here - but something like 'the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Via Dolorosa" class="internal-link">Via Dolorosa</a></span>,' if you know that name from the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">Passion</a></span> of Christ, when Christ had been sentenced to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> by <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Christianity" data-href="Christianity" class="internal-link">crucifixion</a></span> by <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Pontius Pilate" class="internal-link">Pontius Pilate</a></span>. Then he was beaten, etc., and then was given this cross, this heavy cross. Those who were going to be crucified had to carry their own crosses. Weakened and injured from torture and mistreatment and imprisonment, etc., they had to still carry their crosses to the place, to Golgotha, where they were going to be crucified, going to be executed, basically. And if you know from the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Christianity" data-href="Christianity" class="internal-link">Catholic tradition</a></span>, there's the Stations of the Cross that they do every year, and there are certain moments on that whole path that get kind of contemplated and meditated upon, in that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> on the Stations of the Cross. But that whole journey towards one's execution, that's the iconic movement or moment. So Christ carrying his cross. It could be on the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Via Dolorosa" class="internal-link">Via Dolorosa</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > 🟡 Excercise 5 1 _Via Dolorosa_" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#🟡 Excercise 5 1 _Via Dolorosa_" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-1
###### 12-2
It doesn't have to be Christ. It could be someone anywhere about to be executed. It could be, again, borrowing from the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Christianity" data-href="Christianity" class="internal-link">Christian tradition</a></span>, the martyrs about to be thrown to the lions, or walking out into the amphitheatre before the lions. They know what's coming. Maybe they can even see or hear the lions, and they're just there, in that amphitheatre, in the moments before their execution, before their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>. What's key in this also is that they are surrounded - or Christ, or this person who is executed, or the martyrs in the amphitheatre, or someone before a firing squad - they're surrounded by those who are certainly willing one's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, but even more than that, they're mocking and jeering. It may or may not be everyone in the crowd, but certainly a good portion, and maybe everyone is mocking and jeering the victim of execution<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Doesnt have to be christ can be martyrs in the Coliseum" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Doesn't have to be christ can be martyrs in the Coliseum" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-2
###### 12-3
This is all part; I'm describing this moment. And yet, the one about to be executed has <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a></span>. What does that mean? <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">Faith</a></span> in what? Has a sense of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> somehow. Has perhaps even a sense of themselves as <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, or even the whole scene as <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, and the whole event as <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, and the whole transpiring of their execution and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> and the mockery and the loneliness. Has a sense of somehow in this horrific and tragic <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, execution, brutality, there is somehow my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="telos" class="internal-link">telos</a></span> here. This is somehow part of what I've been called towards. Somehow this is part of my fulfilling my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="duty" class="internal-link">duty</a></span> to the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="daimon" class="internal-link">daimon</a></span>, to the divine, to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Faith telos duty" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Faith telos duty" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-3
###### 12-4
Now, it's not that the horror and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> itself, themselves, or taken alone, so to speak, that form the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="telos" class="internal-link">telos</a></span>, that constitute the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="telos" class="internal-link">telos</a></span>. But rather, they are somehow part of, a piece of, a much larger <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-movement</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-duty</a></span>, because of how the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> is moving through the whole thing, how the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> is relating to it. It's _that_, together with the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. And also because of what and whom the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> is standing with. Because of what and whom the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> is standing with and standing for. It's this standing with and standing for, and the _how_ of the ways in which the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> is moving through that _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and seeing it, and sensing it with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, and relating to it, that all this becomes somehow mysteriously part of a larger, wider and more profound <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="telos" class="internal-link">telos</a></span>, movement of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Its about the soul that is moving through that dukkha" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#It's about the soul that is moving through that dukkha" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-4
###### 12-5
And of course, it may well be, as well, that amongst all these - the sense of rightness, and the presence of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span> and all that - it may be that, it probably _would_ be that, amongst all that, there can certainly be, and probably _will_ be, some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, some terror, some sense of torment, some doubt; a sense of loss and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>, of course; a sense of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> being stretched to its limits by what it's being asked to go through - almost, perhaps, to breaking point, whatever that might mean. So that kind of complex of emotional and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>-reactions can be there too. There's plenty here that can be very, very rich<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Sense of rightness and being stretched to the limit" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Sense of rightness and being stretched to the limit" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-5

It could be any of those. It could be Christ, if that works for you - Christ carrying the cross on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Via Dolorosa" class="internal-link">Via Dolorosa</a></span>. It could be the Christian martyrs to the lions. It could be just someone, somewhere, at some time, before a firing squad, being executed. Perhaps they're a political prisoner, and they're being executed for speaking the truth, speaking out against power. The outer environment of that whole <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> has with it this jeering, and this incredible cruelty, but also jeering. The inner environment, so to speak, or the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-environment</a></span>, has with it <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a></span>, a sense of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span>, self as <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, or other, maybe the whole scene as <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>; a sense of one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="telos" class="internal-link">telos</a></span>, one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="duty" class="internal-link">duty</a></span>.

And the exercise here, this is the first part of exercise five, and they don't have to be in any order. I think there are four parts for now. We could add or change some or whatever. I'm just throwing out some examples here. But in this first one, then, one might just stand there. I'm just standing in the amphitheatre. I'm just standing before the firing squad. Or it could be the walking, walking towards the place where they put you to be executed or whatever it was, walking out to the middle of the amphitheatre. That's the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, okay? And your job is, again, to sense into what, in that whole vague description that I've given, and those possibilities - and there can be plenty of other possibilities, that kind of thing - getting a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a></span> for it, sensing it in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, listening to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, listening to the emotional and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-resonances</a></span>, and then just seeing what movements, gestures, voice, or vocalizations want to come<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > The practice is to sense the image in the energy body with the soul-resonances then receive movements gestures voice" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#The practice is to sense the image in the energy body with the soul-resonances then receive movements gestures voice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-2

**(5.2)** So I'm going to give the second one, and then I'm going to say something to qualify this whole exercise. The second one is an iconic moment from the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddhism" data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhist tradition</a></span>: the bhūmisparśa <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudra" data-href="Mudra" class="internal-link">mudrā</a></span>, which means the gesture (<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudra" data-href="Mudra" class="internal-link">mudrā</a></span> is a gesture), <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="bhumi" class="internal-link">bhumi</a></span> is earth or ground, and sparśa is to touch. So it's the gesture of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> touching the earth. Many of you will have seen this statue, with his right hand, sitting there in meditative posture, but the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s right hand touching the earth. This goes back to the mythological story: on the night of his <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>-to-be was sitting there meditating, practising for <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mara" data-href="Mara" class="internal-link">Māra</a></span> comes and challenges him and attacks him in all kinds of ways. One of the challenges was, "What right do you have to sit there? What right do you have to sit in that spot, striving for <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>, and to have taken that vow that you won't move from that spot until <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>? What right do you have to sit there?" And the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> in response gestured, touched the earth, and asked the earth to bear witness - the earth, or the earth goddess to bear witness to his right to sit there, sit in that spot, on the earth, and work for <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>. And the earth did exactly that, and obviated, countered <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mara" data-href="Mara" class="internal-link">Māra</a></span>'s challenge<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > 🟡 Excercise 5 2 _The Bhumisparsa Mudra_" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#🟡 Excercise 5 2 _The Bhumisparsa Mudra_" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-3

Let's qualify this a little bit, because what we're not doing here is a kind of acting exercise. This refers to some of the other exercises that I've been offering over the course of these talks: we're not doing an acting exercise. It's not like, "Oh, how convincing a portrayal can I give of this or that iconic moment?", or even, "If someone didn't know what I was acting out, if I was miming something, would they guess exactly what it was?" "Oh, that's Christ on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Via Dolorosa" class="internal-link">Via Dolorosa</a></span> with his cross!" We're not interested in an exercise in acting, in developing our acting skills. We're not interested, therefore, in what it looks like to an outside observer. That, what it looks like to an outside observer, is much less important than your <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">sense of the energy body</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">emotional body</a></span>, and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a></span> of what's happening, okay<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Its not an acting excercise" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#It's not an acting excercise" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^14-1

What that means in terms of the movement is that movement, gestures, and vocalizations that you make may not be decipherable to someone else. Someone looking at you may have no sense that you're feeling into and letting come through your <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and voice Christ on the road to Golgotha. They may have no sense that you're this kind of person, waiting to be executed. Much more important is that, so to speak, inner sense: the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, the emotional sense, and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a></span>, and just how that wants to move the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. The 'how' is I'm not moving it so that it can look like, so that someone could recognize and say, "Oh, it's _that_." It's just: here's the situation that I'm trying to sense into, the kind of moment I'm trying to sense into, and trying to feel that with my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a></span>, and all the resonances in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">the heart and the soul</a></span>, and then, what movement or gestures want to come, that express it, that are in response to it, that just hold it, that support the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a></span>? Even there, there are slightly different intentions. And again, I'm using my sense of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-resonances</a></span>, etc., and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body sense</a></span>, the emotional sense, to see: what _does_ help?

If we go back to exercise three, I think the last part of exercise three was what I called '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the serpent" class="internal-link">the serpent</a></span>.' If you remember, I was kind of careful to say, "What is that? What's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the serpent" class="internal-link">the serpent</a></span>?" Again, one could hear that and think, "Okay, so now I have to move my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> in a way that looks like a snake." Maybe I get on the ground, and I put my arms by my side, and I sort of wriggle around or writhe around or move, find a way of moving kind of like a snake, and then, "Oh, it's a snake," or it's a worm, or something someone could tell. That's not the point. That wasn't the point in that exercise either. And it may be, also, that in these kind of exercises, whether it's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the serpent" class="internal-link">the serpent</a></span> or these ones that we've just talked about, it may be that there's - and of course, with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s _bhūmisparśa_ _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudra" data-href="Mudra" class="internal-link">mudrā</a></span>_, one could actually just replicate that movement. And of course, that's very easy to do: just take your hand, and you touch the earth. But what we really want is the whole kind of arena and nexus and field of heightened sensitivity and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a></span> and resonance. And then one's open to all kinds of other movements, gestures, and vocalizations as well<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > The Serpent" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#The Serpent" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-3

But it may be that actually in this exercise with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the serpent" class="internal-link">the serpent</a></span>, or one of these from this exercise number five, that there's actually not much movement or sound at all. I'm just standing in front of the firing squad. But everything else that's endemic to that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, in the larger sense of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> - the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Duty" data-href="Duty" class="internal-link">sense of duty</a></span>, the sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, the sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="telos" class="internal-link">telos</a></span>, and also the mystery of that, as well as the sorrow, as well as the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>; the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> of that, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">sense of faith</a></span>, the sense of knowing one is doing the right thing, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nobility" class="internal-link">nobility</a></span> - all that is there.

This sensitivity is more important, and in a lot of these exercises, you know, the emphasis on the sensitivity even _more_ than a sort of clarity of an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. I've mentioned several times, it's actually quite hard to, let's say, dance, and at the same time, have a genuinely <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal image</a></span>, a fully, authentically <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal image</a></span>, at the same time as one is dancing. It's quite difficult. That's not to say that one might not feel a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span> in dancing, or really enjoy it, or it's wonderful in all kinds of ways, or it's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> in some ways. But actually to hold a fully authentic <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal image</a></span>, and be in relation to that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, and dance at the same time, in a way that both the dancing and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span> of both and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span> of both, is kind of mutually enhanced and mutually woven together and implicated, that's quite hard for most people - even most people who have a practice of dance, etc., and of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>. To really knead them together, stitch them together is actually quite difficult<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Holding an imaginal image and dancing at the same time is difficult" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Holding an imaginal image and dancing at the same time is difficult" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-1

So more important, I think, in a lot of these exercises, is the sensitivity. More important than, say, the clarity of an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, or even the presence of an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, in some cases. Sometimes it can be better, then, to start with the idea of developing the sensitivity to subtlety, and going from there.

**(5.3)** I'm going to, like I said, throw out four possibilities for this fifth exercise of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">iconic moments</a></span>. And the third - again, I don't quite know what to call it; perhaps 'waiting for the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>,' or '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the hospitality to the angels" class="internal-link">the hospitality to the angels</a></span>.' Some of you may have come across, there are a couple of online seminars that I did some months ago, and they were filmed. They're somewhere or other on the web, I think.

And one of the illustrations I used for something I was trying to communicate was an <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">icon</a></span> by Rublev. It's quite a famous <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">icon</a></span> in the Orthodox Church. It has two names: one is _The <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Christianity" data-href="Christianity" class="internal-link">Trinity</a></span>_, and one is _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Abraham" data-href="Abraham" class="internal-link">The Hospitality of Abraham</a></span>._ It refers to an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Old Testament" class="internal-link">Old Testament</a></span> story of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Abraham" class="internal-link">Abraham</a></span> in his tent in the wilderness, in the desert, and he sees three travellers walking through the desert.

If you have come across, or if you do in the future come across, those "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Art and Dharma" class="internal-link">Art and Dharma</a></span>" seminars, then what I'm talking about here, for the purposes of this exercise, is really the moments or the time prior to the scene in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">icon</a></span>. Because the scene in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">icon</a></span> is actually just the three <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Abraham" class="internal-link">Abraham</a></span> is no longer there, and the three <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, or the three, if you like, persons of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Christianity" data-href="Christianity" class="internal-link">Holy Trinity</a></span>, are just there at the table, having received <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Abraham" class="internal-link">Abraham</a></span>'s hospitality.

You think, "Well, what exactly is prescribed as a movement or a gesture or a vocalization there?" I don't know. But what would it be just to take that? As I said, at one level, some of these, and this exercise number five aren't meant quite as "I'm just acting something." But when it's not even obvious what movement goes with it, and I'm not even that interested in it looking like that scene, then it becomes an exercise at a whole other level, to do with sensitivity and attunement and openness and just seeing and connecting <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, voice</a></span>.

Can I feel my way in? And how do I feel my way into that? Maybe I don't even know the story.

In fact, _any_ element of the whole <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">constellation of the imaginal</a></span> can become <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. It may be that the reverence itself, as a part of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking poise</a></span>, becomes <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, or the humility, or whatever it is. Another way - and I touched on this the other day, just threw it out quite briefly - or another kind of iconic moment here that may help some people to find a way into this third part of this example is the preparation for the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath</a></span>, on the Friday of the Jewish <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath</a></span>. The preparation for welcoming the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath</a></span>, and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath</a></span> in its presence, its sort of visitation of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sabbath" data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Shekhinah</a></span>, the female aspect of God, sometimes also called the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sabbath" data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Bride of God</a></span>, the Bride of the Divine. And what the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath</a></span> _is_ is a kind of visitation into our lives, into this plane of existence, of that level of the divine, of that aspect, of that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">face of the divine</a></span>. And so, what is _that_, to humbly and reverentially, and with sensitivity and care, open up the space, and create the space in one's house, in one's being, in the house of one's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, in the space that one's in, the physical space that one's in, and open that space for the immanent visitation, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a></span>, arrival, of the bride, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sabbath" data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Bride of God</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sabbath" data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath Bride</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sabbath" data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Shekhinah</a></span>? So that would be the third one, something like that: <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Abraham" data-href="Abraham" class="internal-link">Abraham&#x27;s hospitality to the angels</a></span>, the preparation for welcoming the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking poise</a></span> itself. Again, very hard to know what's prescribed there, or what it would look like, and it may be that not much movement or sound is involved at all. But it may be that there _is_ a lot. You have to feel your way into these things<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Any element of the whole constellation of the imaginal can become imag e g Shekhinah" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Any element of the whole constellation of the imaginal can become imag e g Shekhinah" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-3

**(5.4)** Okay, the last possibility I just want to offer for now - and you can hear in the kind of thing that I'm talking about that there are many possibilities here, but the last one for now is to take the example of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Rosa Parks" class="internal-link">Rosa Parks</a></span>. Many of you know the story, obviously, and what happened. It's a significant part of - well, _human_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span>, actually, but also certainly civil rights <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span> in the US, and racial justice <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span>. So in 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, there was, at that time, basically, in effect, racist laws - all kinds of racist laws, but also on public transport, and a kind of apartheid placed there by law. And at the discretion, in this case, of the bus driver, they could ask or demand, really, African Americans, sitting - the bus was divided into two parts: a so-called 'Negro/coloured section,' rather, and a 'white section,' and there was this basically apartheid going on. And if the whites-only section got filled, then the bus driver could extend the whites-only section, and basically make the African Americans have to get up and stand, so that the white people could sit down<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > 🟡 Exercise 5 4 _Rosa Parks_" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#🟡 Exercise 5 4 _Rosa Parks_" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-1

So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Rosa Parks" class="internal-link">Rosa Parks</a></span>, who was already an activist by that point and knew what she was about, was coming home from work one day, and this is exactly what happened: she took her seat in the so-called 'coloured section' early on in the trip, and then after a few stops, the whites-only section got filled, and then the bus driver told her to move - told her, and I think three or four others, to move, three or four other African Americans to move. They moved, and she did not move. She refused. And that's the sort of iconic moment, okay<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Rosa Park not moving was an iconic moment" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Rosa Park not moving was an iconic moment" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^17-2

What _is_ clear is that it's dangerous. What she was doing was dangerous, and it would have negative and probably harmful consequences. It was clear that it therefore took courage. She knew this. And she also knew something is _right_ about what I'm doing here, and something is _wrong_ about what is being enforced by the law, by racist law<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > What she was doing was dangerous and therefore took courage" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#What she was doing was dangerous and therefore took courage" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-3

So she was actually fired from her job. She worked as a seamstress in a local store, in a department store, and she was fired because of this later. And, in fact, she received <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Death" data-href="Death" class="internal-link">death threats</a></span> for years as a result, as a consequence for this, for this immovability. [pauses] I don't know what else to tell you about this. Yes, I think it's in her autobiography, she said that when that white bus driver, he came back and he said that to us, and he waved his hand, ordered us up and ordered us out of our seats, she said, I quote: ^17-4

Already in what she's talking about, there's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> there. It's in the sense of her <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. All these exercises we're talking about have to do with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body and soul</a></span>, and the connection between <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>.

We've talked in other talks about how all that, we can see all that, understand all that whole arena of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ethics" class="internal-link">ethics</a></span> and morality and values, virtues, etc., from the perspective of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>.

But I want to point out, in her very <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, her <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> was very, very central. What enabled her to do that, perhaps, was the integration of her <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">bodily sense</a></span> with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a></span>, integrated with the ethical sense - these three, almost not separate. All through these exercises, these five exercises, this is part of what I'm wanting to almost knead together, knit together, grow into each other - <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a></span>, and voice. In terms of her voice, as I said, she was already an activist. She was already pretty outspoken, etc., and she continued to be for the rest of her life. Another interesting thing she said was that in that moment, when she didn't move, she said, "I just thought of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Emmett Till" class="internal-link">Emmett Till</a></span>, and I just couldn't go back," you know, "where he was telling me to go," couldn't go back to the so-called 'coloured section.'^[_Library of Congress_, "Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words," [https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/rosa-parks-in-her-own-words/about-this-exhibition/the-bus-boycott/emmett-till-with-his-mother/](https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/rosa-parks-in-her-own-words/about-this-exhibition/the-bus-boycott/emmett-till-with-his-mother/), accessedSept. 2020: "Jesse Jackson asked her why she refused to move to the back of bus.

<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Emmett Till" class="internal-link">Emmett Till</a></span>, again, many of you will know, or you should know, was a 14-year-old African American boy. Something happened, but it's very unclear what, if anything, indeed happened. But he was accused of 'offending' (I'll put that word in inverted commas), or perhaps 'flirting with,' or something like that - whether even _that_ happened or not, he was accused of 'offending' a white woman or a white girl in a grocery store or something one day. And he basically got lynched and murdered by four white men. There was a trial, but those four white men were acquitted of his murder. That was not that long before this happened with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Rosa Parks" class="internal-link">Rosa Parks</a></span> in 1955. She said, "When that happened, that bus driver came back, I just thought of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Emmett Till" class="internal-link">Emmett Till</a></span>, and I just couldn't move." And again, it's not for me to suppose the workings of her <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> and heart there. But you recognize that she is also thinking of a figure, a dead figure, someone who has become very meaningful in her life because she was involved, to some extent, in the whole movement for justice there in relation to his trial. But she draws on an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> and the memory of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Emmett Till" class="internal-link">Emmett Till</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > She draws on an image Emmett Till" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#She draws on an image Emmett Till" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^18-2

That's just an interesting observation there. And again, what enabled this immovability that she had, and this conviction that she had, and this courage not to move, courage to break the law, courage to defy what she was being told to do? She also writes in her autobiography, she says: ^18-3

She said that's actually not true. Somehow the story got polluted a little bit, or watered down a little bit. It wasn't just that she was tired. She says: ^18-5
###### 18-6
> I was not tired physically, or no more tired than I usually was at the end of a working day. And I was not old, although some people have an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of me as being old then. I was 42.

And then, again, in terms of consequences, one of the beautiful consequences - this is part of what we don't know, in terms of when we really act in line with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="duty" class="internal-link">duty</a></span> of our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> and the callings of our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, we can't always know the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> and the fruit that comes out of that act. So one of the consequences was that the African American residents of Montgomery, Alabama, boycotted the public bus service, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Rosa Parks" class="internal-link">Rosa Parks</a></span>'s court case was actually being slowed down. They had to exercise tremendous tenacity walking to work, not taking the buses, car sharing where they had cars, whatever, really staying steady. It would have been much easier to take the buses. They boycotted the buses, putting indirectly financial pressure, then, on the bus company, because they weren't getting that business. Many buses just stood there empty in the garage because they weren't being filled, because the African American people who were boycotting the buses weren't filling the buses and paying for them. So eventually the city retracted, repealed the law requiring segregation on public buses. Of course, there's a larger story there with the whole civil rights movement and the US Supreme Court and all that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > African American residents boycotted the public bus service" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#African American residents boycotted the public bus service" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^18-7

Again, these don't have to be exact; I'm just picking examples here to give you a sense of the kind of things that you might explore in these exercises. Apparently <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Rosa Parks" class="internal-link">Rosa Parks</a></span>, as a personality, she carried herself with a very dignified demeanour, naturally dignified. She was quite quiet, apparently, as a person, and serene, but dignified, without in any way being pompous or putting on airs or anything like that. And that, too, I think, is part of the flavour of this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> that I want to communicate here. Her demeanour, her personality, was quiet and serene, dignified, but you can hear - I _hope_ you can hear - you can get a sense of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-power</a></span> there, and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-conviction</a></span>, and how much her <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> is involved in that, and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-stretch</a></span>, and all of it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Her demeanour was quiet and seren dignified with soul-conviction" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Her demeanour was quiet and seren dignified with soul-conviction" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^19-1

Now, okay, so here's a certain personality, a certain kind of style of expression. Certainly it's not to imply that the only way to stand firm is in a quiet and serene way. I don't want to imply that at all. But if this is the kind of iconic moment we're drawing on or we're focusing on for this part of this exercise, then that's actually part of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, that it is quiet and serene. So maybe you can get a sense of that, of what would it be to sense into that whole, the whole <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Gestalt psychology" data-href="Gestalt psychology" class="internal-link">gestalt</a></span>, the whole configuration of that whole moment, that whole <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, that whole time, that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">icon</a></span>, that iconic moment, and then see how that wants to be mirrored or refracted or expressed with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, voice</a></span>, or what wants to manifest or express in response to that or from that as a seed. As I said, you can hear three slightly different directions there, right? One is kind of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">embodying</a></span> it. One is reflecting. One is more refracting. And one is just seeing: what happens in my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, and from my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> or included in my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> - that's better: included in my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> - including the aspects of my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, which are my movement, my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, my gesture, and my voice? Including those aspects of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, what wants to manifest? Either because it's refracting it, reflecting it, or thirdly, just in response to it or from it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Embodying reflecting refracting" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Embodying reflecting refracting" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^19-2

Again, these kinds of exercises may feel, at one level, very easy, but at another level - or maybe it's open-ended, and you can hear, "Hmm, there's quite a lot of subtlety here possible, and could be quite difficult." I don't know. You'll have to find your way in, and play, and see. All these exercises are really, I'm offering them as seeds, just seeds. It's not my intention at all that these exercises become kind of canonical or rigid: "This is now what we do.

And then I'm back to choosing, "Oh, Rob said the movements, it's not important.

It's almost like the opposite kind of movement, just very fluid and watery. And I keep gravitating towards _that_ kind of movement. I've forgotten the principle.

I might have understood it at one point, but I've forgotten it, and in not keeping the principle current, it has allowed the force of probably long-standing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> - and as I said, usually the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span> here go on, have been reiterated and strengthened over decades, and some other possibilities have atrophied, some other avenues have been blocked for decades<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > What out for rigid reasserting habits" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#What out for rigid reasserting habits" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^20-3

If I remind myself of the principles - this is what I said about structural listening and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> things structurally - the principle tells me. If I understand the principle, then I understand, "Oh, yeah. It's about range.

It's almost a stock phrase or stock sentence introducing some tantras. In English, it says, "Thus have I heard, on one occasion, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddha" data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Bhagavān</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddha" data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">the Blessed One</a></span>, was dwelling (vijahāra)," it says, in sarvatathāgatakāyavākcittaguhyahṛdayavajra.

And then you get this compound, which is kind of like a jewel, multifaceted jewel that, because of the structure of the Sanskrit language, can yield so many different permutations of meaning.

Sarvatathāgata means, in Sanskrit, 'all the Tathāgatas.' <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddha" data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Tathāgata</a></span>, some of you will know, is an epithet that the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> used to refer to himself. He didn't call himself the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>. I mean, once in a while, but mostly he called himself the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddha" data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Tathāgata</a></span>. And <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddha" data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Tathāgata</a></span> was a word that was, I think, I'm pretty sure, around before the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s time, and he picked it up. Even _he_ gave multiple possible interpretations of what that word, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddha" data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Tathāgata</a></span>, could mean, what the name, or _a_ name, he had given himself could mean. Once you came to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a></span>, there were even more interpretations. Probably before him there were others. And there's a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">proliferation</a></span> of meanings as you get into the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vajrayana" data-href="Vajrayana" class="internal-link">Vajrayāna</a></span>.

But it can also mean 'the one who has come from the truth, come from reality.' So it's got multiple meanings just in the word <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddha" data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Tathāgata</a></span>.

Just to say one last thing for now in regard to these exercises and this notion of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span>. In a way, I said part of it before, which is that we can have a preliminary exercise, or a sort of foundation exercise, and as we develop that, and as the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> develops, the range, both in terms of a sort of lateral scope, breadth, and depth and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span>, and the sensitivity and the subtlety and all the rest of it, of that practice really starts to expand as we practise the exercises, as the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> kicks in, in relation to those preliminary exercises, and that field, that arena or domain. What starts as a preliminary becomes in itself <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> and gets stretched in all kinds of ways. I want to repeat that as well, here, now<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > What starts as preliminary becomes in itself soulmaking" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#What starts as preliminary becomes in itself soulmaking" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^22-5

A second thing, and very related, is if you ask, say, a Tibetan rinpoche, or someone with a lot of practice in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tibetan Buddhism" data-href="Tibetan Buddhism" class="internal-link">Tibetan tradition</a></span>, or who is even regarded as a master, and you ask them, say a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dzogchen" class="internal-link">Dzogchen</a></span> master or something like that, where there's so much emphasis in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dzogchen" class="internal-link">Dzogchen</a></span> on _not_ doing, sort of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ultimate Truth" data-href="Ultimate Truth" class="internal-link">the ultimate</a></span> practice in that kind of language, or some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Mahamudra" class="internal-link">Mahamudra</a></span> traditions, etc., and you actually ask them, or they report what they spend most of their formal practice time doing, they still, even after many years, spend perhaps most of their time doing what are basically preliminary exercises. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Ngöndro" class="internal-link">Ngöndro</a></span> is the Tibetan, some of you will know. So yes, 'preliminary' as in, "This needs to come first. This is what precedes." But it doesn't necessarily mean that then, "Okay, now I've done that, and then I stop. First we do this, then I stop doing that because I've done it, and I've accomplished what I want to accomplish, and I can just do my sort of more advanced practice." There's that whole relationship with this notion of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span> that's very much the kind of dominant one, actually, in people who take their practices in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Tibetan Buddhism" class="internal-link">Tibetan Buddhism</a></span> very, very seriously, and rinpoches and masters, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Rinpoches spend most of their time doing Ngöndro what are basically preliminary excercises" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Rinpoches spend most of their time doing Ngöndro what are basically preliminary excercises" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^23-1

I'm not really sure about this word, 'preliminary.' I'm partly picking it and using it because there _are_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span>, as I've tried to explain, to certain areas, directions, domains of our being and our life's opening up with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. So in some ways they _are_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span>. But also, as we've explained, they can be expanded, stretched, developed. They can become <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> in themselves. They can become extraordinary and not basic at all. So there's a whole range, and I think you will get that sense with all this<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Im not really sure about the word preliminary" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#I'm not really sure about the word 'preliminary'" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^23-2

How does one relate to this, all these practices, over time, as one's developing one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> practices? There are <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span>, and there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. Maybe it's in parallel, these two, and going back and forth, and periods of one or the other, all that. So I don't know that that's necessarily universally formulaic. One might have to see. But for right now, we can use the word 'preliminary' with that, with that caveat<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > There are preliminaries and theres soulmaking" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#There are preliminaries and there's soulmaking" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^23-3
