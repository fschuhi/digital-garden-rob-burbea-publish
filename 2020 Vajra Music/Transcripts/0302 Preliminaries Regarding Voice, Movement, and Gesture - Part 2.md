###### 1-1
Okay, I'd like to continue and explain the third exercise, or this set of exercises, really - the third set of exercises or exercise, depending on how we're conceiving of them. But I also want to say a few more general things. We'll start with the general things, and take our time, and not rush, and then introduce the third one, and say a little bit more about the 'why' of all this<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Third set of excercises but a few general things first" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Third set of excercises but a few general things first" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1

So these <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, and voice</a></span> exercises, these instructions, this material, is in addition, to be added to what is already there in previous talks that we've recorded over the last years. And I tried to give a little list, but I know there are some I'm forgetting. In fact, I remember sitting right here, not on a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, recording something, offering some instructions or some possibility for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> around ensouling the voice, but I cannot for the life of me recollect where that is.^[Rob may be referring to "Daimon, Refracted" (30 May 2019), [https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/58766/](https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/58766/), accessedAug. 2020. The guided meditation begins at 1:45:24] So there may be other material as well. But anyway, it's all to be taken together, put together as a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> of material - a kind of strand within the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking Dharma</a></span>, within the practices. Some of what we'll say in this set of talks will repeat some of what's there, and some stuff will be there that's not here. In other words, I said other stuff there that I'm not going to repeat here, and vice versa - there will be new stuff here that wasn't said there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Daimon Refracted 🟢" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Daimon Refracted 🟢" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2

I'm just curious. I wonder, or I am wondering, how many people who have listened to or even took part in those exercises - I can't remember which <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> it was; it might have been _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Foundations of a Soulmaking Dharma" class="internal-link">Foundations of a Soulmaking Dharma</a></span>_. I can't remember, but the talks are up on Index/<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma Seed" class="internal-link">Dharma Seed</a></span>, called "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Voice, Movement, and the Possibilities of Soul" class="internal-link">Voice, Movement, and the Possibilities of Soul</a></span>," I think, and I think there are two parts.^[Rob Burbea, "Voice, Movement, and the Possibilities of Soul" [Partsand 2] (24-26 June 2018), [https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=voice+movement+possibilities](https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=voice+movement+possibilities), accessedAug. 2020] I wonder how many people, of everyone who has perhaps listened to those talks, how many actually picked up those exercises and practised them, repeated them in practice? Or how many even listened and practised, as opposed to just listened? But really, how many actually picked it up, picked those exercises up, and pursued it, and developed it as a practice? I'm actually genuinely curious about that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Voice Movement and the Possibilities of Soul but how many have picked it up 🟢" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Voice Movement and the Possibilities of Soul but how many have picked it up 🟢" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3
###### 1-4
I'm also genuinely curious that, if not - in other words, if you perhaps heard those talks, or had a little go with it, and then you didn't pursue it - why not? I'm genuinely curious about that, and I'm going to suggest that it would be good for all of us to be genuinely curious, if that's the case. Why not? I think that's probably an interesting question, and I really mean it as a question, not as, if someone says, "Why not? Why didn't you do that?", and then it just becomes a self-judgment thing: "Oh, yes. It's another thing that I've failed at, or didn't do well, or whatever, neglected, whatever it is." But actually, it's an interesting question. If I didn't, if you didn't, why not? It's an interesting question, insofar as it might shed light on those areas and issues we touched on yesterday: <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>. How much of not taking up those practices, and not kind of galvanizing oneself to do what's unfamiliar, what _does_ take a bit of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> and a bit of _oomph_ and a bit of, "Pff. Now I really have to do this," and it's different than sitting there quietly with the legs crossed in the usual <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation posture</a></span>, or on a chair or whatever it is, doing my usual practice<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > If not why not" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#If not why not" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4
###### 2-1
It's an interesting question. If one didn't, the "why not?" becomes an interesting question, insofar as it might illuminate those areas and issues we talked about, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>, and also the question of discriminating significance, or failing to discriminate/discern significance. These are two things we talked about yesterday. Maybe I didn't because of inertias of different kinds in my practice, in my relationship with practice, what and how I practise and all that, and the form of practice, and how that can get kind of just rigidified, kind of set. Practice is something that you don't move much, or it doesn't make much noise. It's not loud like that. We're quite wild, rambunctious, you know, some of what was there. Was it <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>, partly, or was it, "I just didn't discern it. Didn't occur to me as something … I didn't grasp it as something significant"<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Why not points to failing to discriminate discern signifiance" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Why not points to failing to discriminate discern signifiance" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
There were, as I mentioned yesterday, lots of other reasons why not, to do with how I put the teaching out, and not taking enough time, and rushing through things, etc. But insofar as it sheds light on those two areas - I mean, also <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pedagogy" data-href="Pedagogy" class="internal-link">pedagogically</a></span>, I think; it's interesting, as we go forward, to take more time, and really earmark something: "Okay, this is a thing now. This is a practice. And here we put a ring fence around it, and make it a thing, and make people do it." So <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pedagogy" data-href="Pedagogy" class="internal-link">pedagogically</a></span> it's also an interesting question and something to bear in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. But as far as it sheds light, as I said, on the issues, the areas of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>, and the capacity to discern the significance of something that we read or hear. It becomes a very interesting question: "Why didn't I pick that up, and pursue it, and develop it, and repeat it, and practise it?" So I'll leave that with you<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > The question also sheds light on pedagogy" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#The question also sheds light on pedagogy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
We introduced yesterday these two first exercises. We just called them exercises one and two. And just to repeat a little bit, again, a little too brief: why? Some of the 'why' for those two exercises has to do with, well, firstly, developing sensitivity. Again, how much sensitivity, and the development of sensitivities, is part of, so much an integral part of, a necessary part of, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking Dharma practice</a></span>, practices. They so depend on sensitivity, and sensitivity, in this case, to movement, to gesture, to voice; sensitivity to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>; sensitivity to the space, to sound. So all that was in exercises one and two, this possibility of developing sensitivity, and how important that is in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking Dharma practice</a></span> - increasing the scope or the area in which we are sensitive, and to which we are sensitive, and the range of aspects of being and expression to which we are sensitive, and increasing the sensitivity as well<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Recap from yesterday its about sensitivity" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Recap from yesterday it's about sensitivity" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
A second reason why has to do with: is it possible (and I think it _is_ very possible) that we can live as human beings in this culture of ours, this complex culture of ours, a complex <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, complex <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sociology" data-href="Sociology" class="internal-link">social dynamics</a></span>, etc., complex psychologies, and our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> and our voice can be held in, our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> can be held in, held back, habitually, often unconsciously, and often not even through a conscious choice? We're holding ourselves back, holding ourselves in, as a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sankhara" data-href="Sankhara" class="internal-link">habitual holding</a></span>. And that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sankhara" data-href="Sankhara" class="internal-link">holding back of</a></span> our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> and our voice, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sankhara" data-href="Sankhara" class="internal-link">holding back of</a></span> our bodily expression, as well, is actually a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sankhara" data-href="Sankhara" class="internal-link">holding back of</a></span> our libido, of our life <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, of our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Eros" data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">life force</a></span>, and also of our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> (again, in the larger, in the fuller, richer sense of that word, '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>'), and a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sankhara" data-href="Sankhara" class="internal-link">holding back of</a></span> our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. And this, I think, is very, very common <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">in our culture</a></span>, and it may be common - I'm going to say more about this as we go on - it may be especially common in certain ways in some <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma cultures</a></span>. Why exercises one and two, the development of sensitivity in certain areas, and just the increase of sensitivity, both in - what would you say? - refinement and depth, but also in scope? And also this question of, "Is there a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sankhara" data-href="Sankhara" class="internal-link">habitual holding</a></span> back or holding in of my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, of my voice, through my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, which is actually a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sankhara" data-href="Sankhara" class="internal-link">holding back of</a></span> my libido and my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>? Do I have a choice in that? Am I even conscious of that?" It's very important, I think. Very, very important. We'll elaborate on this. I'll elaborate as we go forward<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > We are often held back or holding in of our energy" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#We are often held back or holding in of our energy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 3-1
And we talked about, we used this language of '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span>' and 'exercises.' It's probably obvious, but if we call those exercises and the other exercises we'll give today and hopefully in the coming days, if we call them '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span>,' they're also already presupposing _other_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span> (for example, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, some degree of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body awareness</a></span>). So they're also <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span> that are resting on other <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span>, you could say. That's probably obvious. But also, just a little bit, if you've been listening to the teachings over the last while, even just over the last couple of years, let's say, you can see that some of what we might call '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span>,' and what we might ask for as <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span> from a practitioner, as prerequisites, can then become <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">ensouled</a></span>. On another <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, we talked about the difference between 'foundation' and 'root,' and a root as being something that can actually grow. A foundation is something that's fixed<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Preliminaries can become ensouled" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Preliminaries can become ensouled" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
So this, what is a kind of prerequisite or preliminary, can then become an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">ensouled</a></span> area, and grow and be developed to other levels that we had never, never even anticipated or intuited or dreamt of. This is very clear, for example, if we take two areas that we can consider as <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span>: the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> - and we've seen <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> is this kind of thing, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, this kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, this kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of the body</a></span>; people get a hang of that. But after a while, we talked about the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">imaginal-energy body</a></span>, that that very <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">sense of the energy body</a></span> can become <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, and can be related to as <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal image</a></span>. It's not just a sort of basic instrument; it becomes itself an <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">erotic-imaginal object</a></span>. It becomes <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">ensouled</a></span>. It becomes alive and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">ensouled</a></span>. Its depth, the range of its possibility, what it can be, how it can manifest, how we can feel it, the whole relationship with it becomes erotic and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>. And the whole thing just kind of balloons out exponentially to include other possibilities. So that would be one example of a preliminary or prerequisite that then becomes <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">ensouled</a></span>, and then just completely opens out, actually infinitely, to other possibilities<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Energy body excercises open towards relating to it as imaginal image" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Energy body excercises open towards relating to it as imaginal image" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
A second example would be _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sila" data-href="Sila" class="internal-link">sīla</a></span>_, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ethics" class="internal-link">ethics</a></span>. Again, we rest our teaching, as <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma teachings</a></span>, as a set of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma teachings</a></span> within the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma teachings</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sila" data-href="Sila" class="internal-link">sīla</a></span>, of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ethics" class="internal-link">ethics</a></span>, and in our case, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Precepts" data-href="Precepts" class="internal-link">five precepts</a></span> that we receive from the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Theravada" data-href="Theravada" class="internal-link">Theravādan</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddhism" data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhist tradition</a></span>, taking those very seriously as a basis. And as practice develops (and I've outlined in two sets of talks now: "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Sila and Soul" class="internal-link">Sila and Soul</a></span>"^[Rob Burbea, "Sila and Soul" [Parts 1-9] (9-17 June 2019), [https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=sila+and+soul](https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=sila+and+soul), accessedAug. 2020] and "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="The Image of Ethics" class="internal-link">The Image of Ethics</a></span>"), and as ^[Rob Burbea, "The Image of Ethics" [Parts 1-6] (14-19 Feb. 2020), [https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=the+image+of+ethics+orchard](https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=the+image+of+ethics+orchard), accessedAug. 2020]practice develops the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span> starts involving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ethics" class="internal-link">ethics</a></span>, in the sense <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ethics" class="internal-link">ethics</a></span> itself becomes, or values and virtues become, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">erotic-imaginal objects</a></span>, and the whole domain of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sila" data-href="Sila" class="internal-link">sīla</a></span> becomes erotically alive, and alive to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> and for the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, then that whole preliminary basis of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Precepts" data-href="Precepts" class="internal-link">five precepts</a></span>, again, just balloons out in complexity and depth, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span> and range, and demand and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> - all of that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Sila and Soul The Image of Ethics 🟢" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Sila and Soul The Image of Ethics 🟢" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3
###### 3-4
So those would be two examples of areas where a preliminary becomes <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">ensouled</a></span>, and then it becomes something that's potentially - I don't know - the opposite of preliminary: super advanced. But the same could be said of something like _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dana" data-href="Dana" class="internal-link">dāna</a></span>_, or even <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>. Lots of possibilities there in relation to this idea of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span>. And again, to touch on this thread - I'll keep coming back to this, the 'why' of all this, and repeat something I think I said yesterday - why <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span>? Why these exercises, these kinds of exercises? Why even _think_ in terms of exercises or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span>? As I said, we can just hope that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span> - we know, we've heard, or we've even had <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span> - what it does is it will expand things. It will expand its range. It will include more and more. And it will expand something that it's kind of got in its vortex, in its dynamics - some area or aspect of our being or our life. It expands that area. We expand with it. Our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> and our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of that area or aspect of being expands with it, or shatters in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vessel" data-href="Vessel" class="internal-link">breaking of the vessels</a></span>, and then has to be built in a larger way, a deeper, fuller, more far-reaching way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Why preliminaries Because it expands soulmaking" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Why preliminaries Because it expands soulmaking" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-4
###### 4-1
[15:46] So it might be that we can just hope that if we're practising <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, we like it, practising, and we can just hope that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span> will expand, will get hold in its expansion or in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vessel" data-href="Vessel" class="internal-link">breaking of vessels</a></span> that happens occasionally, from time to time (sometimes it's just a stretch; sometimes it's actually a shattering), in that whole process, over time, that eventually it will just, by itself, come to involve and include and ensoul <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, voice</a></span>.

However, if those areas - <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, and voice</a></span>, or, let's say, some directions and possibilities within <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, and voice</a></span> - if the blocks there that we have are really entrenched, if they're entrenched enough, then the power of expansion of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span>, propelled by <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, etc., the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking Dynamic" data-href="Soulmaking Dynamic" class="internal-link">eros-psyche-logos dynamic</a></span>, if the blocks are more entrenched and effectively more powerful than the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span> at that point, it _won't_. It won't ensoul those areas or those possibilities within those areas. Sometimes it does: the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span> just does its thing, and it overcomes, or it stretches those walls, those blocks (we've talked about this), whether they're blocks of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>, or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>, or whatever it is. And sometimes it will come up against them and it won't be strong enough. The blocks are too entrenched. And so those areas will not be included in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span>. They won't be <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">ensouled</a></span>. Certain things won't open up as possibilities.

Now, I don't know. Can we know in advance, with respect to any aspect of our being or area of our life, whether whatever blocks we have there - which are often unconscious anyway - whether they will be weaker or stronger than the push of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span>, the fermentation, the force of fermentation of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span> as it moves into those areas, as it reaches those areas and those aspects of our being and our life? I don't know. How would we know that in advance? Of course, it may well be in many cases that it _does_ expand those limits, push open those walls, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Create-Discover" data-href="Create-Discover" class="internal-link">create/discover</a></span>, open new possibilities, new roads for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, new territories and landscapes. But there will be blocks and walls and limits that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, in its dynamic, in its process, which it encounters, that it does not overcome. It stops there. And those areas remain out of reach, not open. No entry. The road there is not open<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Those areas remain out of reach" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Those areas remain out of reach" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-3
###### 4-4
What does it mean, for example, for <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement/gesture/voice</a></span> to be '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">ensouled</a></span>'? We use this term. What does it mean? What are _we_ meaning, at least, when we say <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement/gesture/voice</a></span> can become <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">ensouled</a></span>? Well, I think for right now it means two main things at least. It means at least these two things, and they're both quite big<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > What does it mean for movement gesture voice to be ensouled" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#What does it mean for movement gesture voice to be ensouled" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-4
###### 4-5
The first is, it means that if the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> wants to express and communicate through or using these aspects of our being, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement/gesture/voice</a></span>, it _can_. They are available. Within those domains of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement/gesture/voice</a></span>, there are roads that are open. Travel is possible. Expansion is possible. So if it means that, to be <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">ensouled</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement/gesture/voice</a></span> to be <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">ensouled</a></span>, means that if <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> wants to express or communicate using or through those aspects of our being, it _can_, because they are there. They're available and they're open. And, you know, the degree of possible development there is infinite. Again, if we go back to the sort of example, the analogy of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span>, it's just completely open-ended, to what degree those arts can be developed. We're talking about the art of movement (say, dance, or a gesture, or a voice), and how the art of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, using those media (<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, voice</a></span>) as expression - there's no limit to the depth and height of the art that is possible there, the arts that are possible there. It's just staggering, what some people are able to do - certainly in terms of technique, etc., but then if you think about in terms of the depth and the height of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> and the breadth of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> that can be coupled with that technique, to bring that sort of really deep <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-power</a></span> that comes through in really great art<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > There are roads that are open" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#There are roads that are open" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-5
###### 5-1
So certainly that, but also, probably for most of us, what we're really talking about is it's available just as part of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> manifesting, or some of the ways the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> manifests and wants to manifest in everyday life, in living our life soulfully, or doing our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>-duties, so to speak. So _if_ it wants to express and communicate through and using those aspects of being, if <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> wants that, it _can_. And that may mean developing the art of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement/gesture/voice</a></span> to some degree - maybe even to an extraordinary degree. But probably for most of us it means just it _can_, in life, in the ordinary manifesting of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> in life. There's not something that bars those directions and domains from being <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">ensouled</a></span>, bars <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> from flowing through and expressing and communicating in and through and with those aspects of our being<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > 1 If soul wants to manifest it can" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#1 If soul wants to manifest it can" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1
###### 5-2
So that's one thing that it means, for <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement/gesture/voice</a></span> to be <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">ensouled</a></span>. A second thing that it means is that the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, and voice</a></span> of oneself or of another, in their everyday, ordinary usages - just the voice speaking, or just having a conversation, or exclaiming something, or the hand moving as it speaks, or whatever it is - those ordinary usages of movement, of gesture, of voice can be sensed with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, can be sensed, therefore, as angelic, as refracting the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="daimon" class="internal-link">daimon</a></span>. They are sensed as dimensional, unfathomable, as divine in origin, as echoing the eternal. So for <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement/gesture/voice</a></span> to be <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">ensouled</a></span>, it means these two main things. I think they're both really, really important, if we talk about opening our lives to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, or our lives being open to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > 2 Ordinary usages of movement gesture voice can be sensed with soul" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#2 Ordinary usages of movement gesture voice can be sensed with soul" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2
###### 5-3
I shared about what I called my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>, particularly in relation to that one sort of area around <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music > Jazz" data-href="Music#Jazz" class="internal-link">jazz guitar</a></span>, improvising <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music > Jazz" data-href="Music#Jazz" class="internal-link">jazz guitar</a></span>, and particularly the technique, really. My <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>. A better word might be 'regret.' I mean, there's definitely a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span> there, but there's also a kind of regret. People might ask, "Oh, you're going to die soon. Is there anything you regret?" Well, that's what I said. There's one thing. There's just one thing, and it's that. Why the word 'regret'? Because, even though I did go to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music" data-href="Music" class="internal-link">music school</a></span> and all that, and conservatory and blah blah blah, it's like, you actually end up having to figure out a lot of stuff on your own, especially if you're doing <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music > Jazz" data-href="Music#Jazz" class="internal-link">jazz</a></span>. You have to find your own ways to do things, and your own kind of avenues that you're interested in, and develop them. There were plenty of things within <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music > Jazz" data-href="Music#Jazz" class="internal-link">jazz</a></span> that I figured out on my own - so to speak, 'on my own'; you're never on your own completely with anything, but. Certainly picking up different pieces here and there, following my intuition, following my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, essentially, and playing, experimenting, creating/discovering - plenty of things I figured out on my own<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > With regard to the grief there were plenty of things within jazz that I figured out on my own" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#With regard to the grief there were plenty of things within jazz that I figured out on my own" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-3
###### 5-4
And looking back, of course, I _could_ have chosen technique in the sense that I was talking about it the other day - these particular areas of technique. I _could_ have chosen that as something to focus on, and say, "Okay, let me just really try and figure this out and get really interested in it." But actually, I effectively chose other areas instead - other areas of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span>, other areas of guitar playing, in fact, as well. And I developed them. That was wonderful, and very fruitful and beautiful, but I could have chosen technique. So it's actually a kind of regret. Yes, I wasn't taught it, because, as I said, there wasn't the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pedagogy" class="internal-link">pedagogy</a></span> there at that time. But I could have just kept bashing away in this dogged way that one has if one really wants something. I didn't. I chose other things instead. So there's regret. There's some responsibility that falls on me<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > I could have just kept bashing away but I didnt" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#I could have just kept bashing away but I didn't" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-4

In a way, [I'm] offering these particular teachings now, offering them so that there's the possibility that you can practise, and practise in a way that you don't end up regretting, that you don't end up regretting not supporting yourself fully, or allowing yourself or enabling yourself fully to move in the direction or be moved in the direction of what _you_ want with respect to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking Dharma</a></span>, and also what you want with respect to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> in life, the expression and the living of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> in life, _your_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> in _your_ life. We must call that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking Dharma</a></span>; it's not something separate<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > So practice in a way that you dont end up regretting" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#So practice in a way that you don't end up regretting" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-1

So offering these, it's part of the 'why'; that's why I shared the story of that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span> and regret. It's like, yeah, because sometimes there are things that are really important to our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, and it's only the fact that we didn't take care of some really basic nuts and bolts that we actually were not able then to reap the benefit and play in the fields of the territories that we would have loved to. This offering is so that you have that choice, and you have a conscious choice, and you can practise so you don't regret<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > We need to take care about the basic nuts and bolts" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#We need to take care about the basic nuts and bolts" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-2

One of the things we said yesterday was these are small pieces, these exercises, this emphasis on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement/gesture/voice</a></span>, and the exercises we'll do. They're little, small pieces, but they're indispensable - both. They're not super central, a super big deal, but they're indispensable - both. There's a kind of … not contradictory, but two sides of that statement, obviously. How do you pick it up? What does hearing something like that _do_ to your relationship and attitude to this whole notion of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span> and exercises, and these particular ones that we're working through? We probably want to avoid two extremes here. I say they're small pieces; therefore, one hears, "Nah, it's not important," and one maybe never bothers to do these exercises. Or, "Well, okay. I'll do them once or twice." That would be one extreme, and I think it would be probably a mistake for most people. Maybe not for everyone, but for most people. Not for everyone<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > What does hearing about preliminaries do to you First extreme never bother" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#What does hearing about preliminaries do to you First extreme never bother" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-3
###### 6-4
The other extreme that you want to avoid is then you hear this, "Okay, small piece, but they're indispensable," and therefore I drop everything else, and I just spend hours every day doing these exercises, and I vow to do no other practices until I've completed three years of just these exercises every day or whatever it is. As usual, a little bit of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span> can go a long way, bringing some intelligence here, knowing one's patterns, recognizing the kinds of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span> one typically gets entrenched in, falls into. All that's really important. As usual, it's really about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">discernment</a></span>, intelligence, and applying that to one's practice<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Second extreme spend hours and years on them before doing something else" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Second extreme spend hours and years on them before doing something else" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-4
###### 6-5
And just a small but important practical thing that I didn't say yesterday: if anything in these exercises, if for any reasons (physical reasons, or reasons of your health), if any part of an exercise or any exercise feels like, "Mm, that wouldn't be good for my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>," or "That's just not possible for my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>," or "It would be dangerous" or something, which is the case for me at this point for one or two of these things, just don't do it, or adapt it. Understand, discern what the kernel of it, what the point is, and adapt it, adapt it to your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>'s condition right now, and the needs and capabilities of your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> right now, okay<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > And always listen to you body adapt it if necessary" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#And always listen to you body adapt it if necessary" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^6-5

Let's move on and introduce exercise three. Now, again, there are five exercises within this. So again, whether it's actually 'exercise three' or 'exercise _series_ three,' I don't know. It doesn't matter. There are five within them. I'll go through them. But again, each of these five could be done physically - in other words, that it's concretized into an actual movement and vocalization or whatever, movements and vocalizations. It could be done concretely, physically. Or it can be done just with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, so to speak, and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">sense of the energy body</a></span> in the imagination only, and there's nothing physical or audible, perceptible there. Each of the five can be done in either or both of those ways, and I would encourage exploring both - really, really encourage exploring both: both concrete, physical, and the not concretized, not physicalized, just the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, just the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">image-sense</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Excercise 3 has 5 parts" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Excercise 3 has 5 parts" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-1

I can give these sort of little nicknames, these five. I'm not sure I'm such a fan of the nicknames I've just come up with very hastily, but it doesn't really matter.

**(3.1)** The first one of the five I've just called something like '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="thunderclap" class="internal-link">thunderclap</a></span>,' or '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Thunderclap" data-href="Thunderclap" class="internal-link">thunder and lightning</a></span>,' okay? But don't take that - certainly don't take it too literally, and don't take it too narrowly either. What I mean by this exercise, what I want to get at by this exercise - and I think this one is really, really important. It was actually _this_ one, more than any other of all the exercises that I'm offering, that kind of was the start of this idea that something needs to be offered, it would be a good idea to offer something. This one, I think, is very important<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > This was the one which started it all" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#This was the one which started it all" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-4

What I mean is, the object is, an emphatic, brief or sudden gesture or movement, maybe with a vocalization. But the whole thing is maybe two seconds, roughly. Something very emphatic and relatively short. If there's a vocalization, it's also relatively short. But within that, 'emphatic' means there's force in it. There's power in it. There's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> and strength in it. And <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> is coming through. In this case, I mean '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>' in a slightly more limited sense, or rather, as a minimum in a limited sense; it may come through in a kind of fully <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal sense</a></span>, etc., but I don't necessarily mean that at the start. It's just an exercise. I mean '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> coming through,' I mean '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>' as the spirit, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Eros" data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">life force</a></span>, the being, the person, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>. And really, it's coming through in a consolidation, in a gesture, in a movement, in a vocalization that consolidates, coheres, coalesces <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, intention, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, in and through <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture</a></span>, or voice<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Emphatic gesture" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Emphatic gesture" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-5

So something like just a stamp of the foot and maybe some kind of gesture with the arms or the fists, or just a gesture with the arms, or just stamping the foot/feet or whatever, or a kick, or a step, or a karate chop - something like that. The movement itself, anyone can do the movement - well, some of us can't do these kinds of movement at this point, but most people without physical difficulties, struggles, can do something like that movement. What's much harder is to have that sense of real coming together, coherence, congruence, consolidation, coalescence, integration, in that brief - whatever it is - two seconds. The integration of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, intention, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, person, in and through the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, and voice</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Thunderclap examples" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Thunderclap examples" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-6

And again, the vocalization could be anything. It could be a "hah!", or a slightly longer tone. It really doesn't matter. And again, we talked about it could be spontaneous: you don't actually know what you're going to do. You just feel the impulse, and let that coalesce, and let it come out. Or it could be it's a precise move. You've rehearsed it, and you know exactly what it looks like and what it's going to sound like, and you do that. Those two alternatives will apply to all of these five examples<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > variations" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#variations" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-7

It would be easier if you could see me and I could demonstrate, even though I'm very limited in what I can do physically right now, but I hope you can get the sense of this. You know, when someone is doing kung fu or karate, in a way, that's what they're doing. They chop bricks or whatever it is, or they make a move. That's part of their training, is to bring everything together: <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, intention, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, like that. And it's surprisingly rare, and in some circles, it's even more rare than it might be in other circles. So can I do this? Can I train in doing that? And as I said, I think, or for me, this is the most important one, even, perhaps, of everything that I'm going to offer. And there are reasons for me saying that. I'll come back to that. But it may be you just think, "Well, I don't know. That doesn't sound very interesting at all." Just notice your response<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Bring everything together mind intention soul body" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Bring everything together mind intention soul body" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-1

After that, after you've done your gesture, if this was <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span>, if we were doing this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span>, or if this was a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreat setting</a></span> and I was introducing this, I would say, "Okay, the way we're going to do this is" - let's say we have this whole week, whatever, if it's a week <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> - "every day, you're going to come into an interview room with me, and I'm going to sit there, and you're going to do this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="thunderclap" class="internal-link">thunderclap</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Thunderclap" data-href="Thunderclap" class="internal-link">thunder and lightning</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture</a></span>, vocalization thing. You just come in. Prepare yourself, and then you do it in front of me, and I'm watching you." Then, after you do it, _you_ assess it. Maybe you say, "Oh, yeah, it felt like I wasn't quite in my feet there," or "I could feel I was holding back a little in my voice," or "Mm, I could feel that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> was really coming through, but it was more, I guess, hysterical than coherent. It wasn't really congruent like that.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > You assess it first the student" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#You assess it first the student" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^8-2
###### 8-3
And then after _you_ assess, _I_ assess you. [laughs] I'll explain why. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">In our culture</a></span>, in our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma culture</a></span>, this would be a very odd thing, a kind of little exam where you have to do something in front of the teacher, and then they sort of assess you. I'll explain why that would even be part of it in a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreat setting</a></span>. Of course, if you're not in a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreat setting</a></span>, then either you have to just do it on your own and _you_ assess, or you could do it with a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> friend, etc. But I think even the ability to really read these things in another person and sense them is also quite rare, and something that needs developing, and probably will only develop, again, through practice. For most people, it will probably only develop through practice and through doing it oneself. Then some people will develop the ability to sort of get a sense with other people. We can be easily misled in these areas, very easily misled. And that's something I'll come back to later<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Then I assess it the teacher" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Then I assess it the teacher" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-3

Again, if we were on a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreat setting</a></span>, and I was introducing this, and say that, "Okay, come once a day. You're going to do this thing. It will be a thread through your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>," and you can practise these exercises or that exercise on your own as much as you want in motionless, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">silent meditation</a></span>, as I said, just with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal sense</a></span> or the imaginative sense. And you could also practise, for example, if we were at <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a></span>, you can go out onto the grounds and just practise that as much as you want. Then, once a day, you'd come and do this thing. I'll come back to what's that assessment bit about. I'll come back to that. Anyway, that's number one. I hope I've conveyed something there of that. It would be easier to see me, but anyway, we're recording this, so.

**(3.2)** The second thread of this exercise number three, the second part, is - and again, I'm not sure about the name, but something like '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="borne aloft by angels" class="internal-link">borne aloft by angels</a></span>,' okay? So here, not two seconds. Maybe you've got a maximum of two minutes. You don't have to use all that time. A maximum of two minutes. Certainly more than twenty or thirty seconds, but somewhere between, let's say, thirty seconds and two minutes. You let your <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, or you express with your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of being <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="borne aloft by angels" class="internal-link">borne aloft by angels</a></span>. Somehow these beings who have no weight are bearing you aloft, are holding up your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> on these gossamer threads of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and light, making your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> buoyant, floating, light, weightless<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Make your body buoyant" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Make your body buoyant" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-1
###### 9-2
And your <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, in that, can give itself to being held by the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, and moved by these <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>. The <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, in giving itself, can become fluid. Your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> becomes fluid in this, almost the way that sometimes when they celebrate at a party or something, you can lift someone up, and if there are enough people, you can pass them along. Or in a big crowd, or at a concert, pass people along, hand to hand - a big crowd passes a person along. Something like that, but much more delicate and almost ethereal. The <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> becomes fluid in surrendering oneself to that being held and being moved, so that another part of it is the surrendering oneself, surrendering one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and heart, as much as possible, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. So probably in this, no vocal. It's just moving your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> in a way that expresses that as much as possible. Again, if we were <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span>, you and I might take turns in assessing that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Be moved by these angels" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Be moved by these angels" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-2

**(3.3)** Third part of this exercise, or the third exercise in this series of exercises, is what we might call '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the raging beast" class="internal-link">the raging beast</a></span>.' I don't know what even comes up in your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, or right now, as a reaction when you hear 'raging beast.' Of course, there are many types of beast. Some have tails. Some have horns. Some have fangs. Some have teeth. Some have tongues. All kinds of stuff. Many kinds of beast. So we're not going to put a limit on that. It's just a raging beast, or _the_ raging beast. Maybe it's a ravenous beast. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's just raging<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Different types of beasts" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Different types of beasts" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-3
###### 9-4
Careful how you hear this. Do you hear 'raging beast' and then hear 'evil,' for instance, or '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">ill-will</a></span>'? Certainly to me it _doesn't_ imply that. I want to be very clear about it: this exercise does not imply evil necessarily at all, or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">ill-will</a></span>. But again, somewhere between thirty seconds and two minutes. It might be that within that thirty seconds and two minutes that there are kind of bursts. So you have a little burst of letting this thing come through your <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, or feeling into your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and movement and gesture and vocalization that might come with that, and then that goes a little bit. You let it go. And you gather the intention, gather the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="citta" class="internal-link">citta</a></span>_, gather the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body awareness</a></span>, and then do it again - another burst of up to fifteen seconds, whatever it is. This is all quite loose. Or it may be just two minutes straight, you're really in this thing. Whatever<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Gather the citta then another burst" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Gather the citta then another burst" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-4
###### 9-5
Again, vocalization is possible, but not necessary. Maybe sometimes you do it and there are vocals that come with it, sometimes not. Maybe you try it both ways. And again, depending on the context, we would, both of us, kind of take turns in assessing that, getting more discerning, discriminating about what's working there, what's blocked, what's being included, what the issues are, what areas of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> or ranges are opening or not, etc. [46:55] ^9-5
###### 9-6
**(3.4)** Fourth one is something we might call something like '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the immovable protector" class="internal-link">the immovable protector</a></span>,' or '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Immovable Protector" data-href="The Immovable Protector" class="internal-link">the immovable guardian</a></span>.' Maybe they're human. Maybe they're inhuman. Maybe they're demonic. Maybe they're angelic. Maybe they're animal. Maybe they're some kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">mythic creature</a></span>. It doesn't really matter. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="The immovable protector" class="internal-link">The immovable protector</a></span> or guardian. What are they protecting? Maybe they're protecting the earth. Maybe they're protecting in relation to some kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sociology" data-href="Sociology" class="internal-link">social injustice</a></span> or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sociology" data-href="Sociology" class="internal-link">racial injustice</a></span>, or something or other. That might change from time to time. What's core here is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the immovable protector" class="internal-link">the immovable protector</a></span>, or an immovable guardian. And again, sort of maximum of two minutes. It may be possible that, within those two minutes, it's sort of broken up into little bursts of expression of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, voice</a></span> - perhaps up to fifteen seconds, then kind of gathering, stopping, regrouping. Another burst, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Human Angel Mythic Figure What are they protecting" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Human Angel Mythic Figure What are they protecting" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-6

It may be possible, and even in the name '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the immovable protector" class="internal-link">the immovable protector</a></span>,' it may be possible there's very little movement, but in the stance, in the gesture, in the feel of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, the being, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, that that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of an immovable protector/guardian is gathered and expressed and manifest. So there may be a lot of movement. It may be a little movement. It may be very little movement, or even no movement, but it's in the gesture. It's in the stance. It's in the posture. It's in the feel of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>. Or it may be in the voice. And again, if we were in a certain context, we would do this double assessment thing, or assessing twice. Okay, so that's the fourth one<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Modalities" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Modalities" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-1

**(3.5)** The fifth one, we're just going to call it '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the serpent" class="internal-link">the serpent</a></span>.' But I'm not going to say anything about it. What does it mean, '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the serpent" class="internal-link">the serpent</a></span>'? What _might_ it mean? What's the range of possibility that it might mean? '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="The serpent" class="internal-link">The serpent</a></span>.' Again, maybe up to two minutes, and may include vocal, maybe not - don't know. But '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the serpent" class="internal-link">the serpent</a></span>.' There are a couple of deliberate reasons I'm not saying anything in terms of what that might be. I'm just going to say that. [49:50] ^10-2

And also, as I mentioned, it might be that they're just spontaneous and improvised movements, gestures, vocalizations, or it might be they're quite rehearsed, and you know precisely what the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and voice are going to do beforehand.

So those are the five with the variations for this one, what I'm calling 'exercise number three,' or maybe 'exercise series number three'; I don't know.

And I have come to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a></span> recently whether it's even rarer in some <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma circles</a></span> - including _our_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma circle</a></span>, basically. Just the capacity to actually do that seems quite rare.

Like I said before, if the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking Dynamic" data-href="Soulmaking Dynamic" class="internal-link">eros-psyche-logos dynamic</a></span> is strong enough, and it's stronger, more powerful in its movement than whatever blocks are there or limits, or whatever holding is there, then an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> can arise that actually breaks open those walls, reconnects those <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="circuits" class="internal-link">circuits</a></span>. A flame, a spark jumps over, and in jumping over, connects two points, reignites, makes available again, reconfigures that circuit. And it comes from the power of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span> in constellating an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, and that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> _does_ something, the power of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> is allowed to do something, or has enough <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> power in it to do something, and it reconstitutes, it reconfigures, it reforms that circuit, if we're going to use the language 'circuit.' ^10-6

But oftentimes, as I said, that won't happen. This circuit is cut. Those particular <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Circuits" data-href="Circuits" class="internal-link">circuits are cut</a></span>. And certain kinds of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> and a certain <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">range of images</a></span> just won't arise. They don't arise in practice. They can't, because the circuit is cut. It's cut in relationship to - well, all kinds of things, but <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, voice</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> possibility, and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span>. There are all kinds of things in there. But also, then, there won't be <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> in that direction, because those <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> won't arise. So there won't be <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> in formal practice, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation practice</a></span>, in that direction without those <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>, because the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Circuits" data-href="Circuits" class="internal-link">circuits are cut</a></span>. But it also may well be the case that there won't be <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> in certain areas of one's life. There won't be the possibility of ensoulment, of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, in certain directions of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="duty" class="internal-link">duty</a></span>, and certain kinds of manifestation. And both these lacunae, both these gaps, both these impossibilities - of either the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> to arise, or of the impossibility of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> opening, travelling, moving in, manifesting in certain directions in one's life - all kinds of consequences come from that, regarding one's psychology, one's whole <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>, regarding the heart, regarding <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span> with others, regarding one's duties, so to speak, in life, one's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>-duties included, regarding possibilities for one's life, regarding work, regarding life choices that we make<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > This affects the whole psyche heart relation to others" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#This affects the whole psyche heart relation to others" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-1

And it may well be that we don't even realize that this is going on. Or, for instance, why am I making this choice and not that choice? I don't realize it's because this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Circuits" data-href="Circuits" class="internal-link">circuit is blocked</a></span> or it's cut. It's not available. Therefore, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> cannot move in that direction. And therefore, certain choices don't even occur to me, or I just make them, but I don't even know _why_ I'm making this choice over that choice. Oftentimes, this kind of thing is going on, but a person doesn't even realize. All kinds of consequences, as I said - psychological, emotional, relational, in terms of work, in terms of life choices, duties, possibilities, etc. Someone can say, "I hear about these exercises, but I don't know - this or that, it's just not me," or they say, "It's not relevant to me. I don't know. This thing - yeah, I participated, I did it a few times, but it just doesn't feel relevant." Or, "I don't know. I'm just not interested." It will _seem_ that way, but actually it's because the circuit is cut. It can be very hard to discern really what's going on here<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > It also affects the decision to practice these kind of excercises" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#It also affects the decision to practice these kind of excercises" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-2

All this is by way of saying: careful if you have resistance to some of these exercises, resistances to some of these exercises. It's probably very normal, and of course, you're free to do whatever you want, and pick up and put down. It's completely up to you. I'm just inviting you to take care, meaning to have a closer look. Have some questioning there. Have some real inquiring, rummaging around and wondering. And in this case, it's really wondering about one's whole life, and the whole patterns of one's life. It's not just wondering about how I felt in that moment when my friend suggested, "Let's do that exercise," and I was like, "Yeah. Okay." Or I listened, and then I felt like, "Mm. It's all right." Just an invitation to really ponder: is there something, a much larger trajectory, absence of trajectory here, in one's life - patterning, limitation, blind spots, incapacities, impossibilities? You can do what you want, but just the invitation to take care, and to really inquire into that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > So careful if you feel resistance to some of these excercises" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#So careful if you feel resistance to some of these excercises" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-3

If maybe you do this stuff, maybe once or twice, and then you neglect, again, the question: why? Why would you neglect this? And again, as a _real_ question, as a genuine inquiry. As I said, it's not that everyone needs to do all this, because some people may already have all that range available. If we just talk about these five we just talked about today, and include, let's say, the ones we did yesterday, they already have all that range available. It's all available vividly and vitally and juicily and soulfully, in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, in their <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a></span> and voice, in the manifestation there, available in their life. In some people, it's all there. It's like, "Not really interested in spending my time doing that," and yeah, why would you need to? You don't need to. I don't need to practise the C major scale again, or I don't need to practise that particular technique again, because it's as developed as it's going to be. I can move on to developing other things<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Why would you neglect to practice this" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Why would you neglect to practice this" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-1

There will be further consequences. And those consequences will include limitations on <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> in life. There will be consequences to neglecting, not picking up, and just kind of giving in to one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span> without really examining it and questioning it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > There are consequences to neglecting" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#There are consequences to neglecting" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-2

So always the choice must be yours. You must have that autonomy. But you can hear, it's a strong encouragement to inquire and to question: "Do I really know what's going on for me here?" And 'here' doesn't just mean 'here and now.' It means in my life, in the patterns of my life, the choices of my life, and the directions I end up taking and not taking<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Do I really know whats going on for me here" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Do I really know what's going on for me here" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-3

Some of these examples, we've said, take two seconds or three seconds or less to do, but the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="circuits" class="internal-link">circuits</a></span> they need may have been shut down or short-circuited, or chopped off, snipped or whatever, for decades. It can seem like the exercise is really not a big deal: "It's this two-second thing. Pff!" But the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="circuits" class="internal-link">circuits</a></span> that they need, or the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="circuits" class="internal-link">circuits</a></span> that are involved in these exercises, or that the exercises, in a way, are trying to re-instigate, may have been shut down for decades. And therefore, it may take repeated practice, certainly - maybe a long time of repeated practice; I don't know - to be able to do these exercises well, to do them properly, even that first one I was talking about, the sort of sudden, emphatic, thunderous gesture and movement and vocalization. To really show up there, congeal with force, with all my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-force</a></span> and power, not held back, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">embodied</a></span>, fully <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">embodied</a></span>, fully - not congealed; that's the wrong word - coalesced, congruent.

All this is not for the sake of self-empowerment. It's not for the sake of winning friends and influencing people. It's not for the sake of making you more attractive. It's not for the sake of making you more whole or more integrated. It's not for the sake of some kind of catharsis: "Oh, yeah. Get my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> out," or whatever it is. But it's primarily so that, as I said, if the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> wants to manifest in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, in emotion, or in life and in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="duty" class="internal-link">duty</a></span> in life, using these kinds of faces, expressing these kinds of theophanies, if that's what <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> wants through you, through <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, through <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, through emotion, through life and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="duty" class="internal-link">duty</a></span>, if that's what <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> wants, it _can_.

Secondarily, through that, I think, through doing these exercises and some of the ones we've done on other <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span>, as well, and some of the ones we did yesterday, it can also, as I said, begin to awaken and ignite the possibility of sensing our everyday <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture</a></span>, and vocalizations, of them being sensed with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, without them being in any way extraordinary. This is part of sensing ourselves and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing others with soul</a></span>. Other aspects of the being, other aspects of life begin to be dimensionalized in that way, as we said<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > And its about everyday sensing with soul" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#And it's about everyday sensing with soul" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-1

Why this business about the assessment and the sort of exam situation? Very unusual in _our_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> tradition, of course. In other <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> traditions, it's rare, but it does exist, absolutely, in other Buddhist <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> traditions. Why would I include that, if we were in a different situation, if we were actually <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span> and I was introducing this? Why? Because being seen and judged makes it usually, for most people, more challenging. One gets <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-conscious</a></span>. One holds back. All kinds of reasons. Sometimes one doesn't even know the reason. But that's actually part of it, because again, if we think about what the relationship here is between these exercises and the possible <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="manifestations" class="internal-link">manifestations</a></span> or duties or work, whatever it is, that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> will ask you to do, will want you to do, those, too, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="manifestations" class="internal-link">manifestations</a></span> of your duties, will be seen and judged in the world and by the world. And what happens then? What happens to our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, to our voice, to our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">expression through the body</a></span> when we feel or know that we _are_ being seen and judged in and by the world<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Why this business about assessment ^assessment-2" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Why this business about assessment ^assessment-2" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^13-2

Putting that piece in, the assessment, the sort of exam piece, actually makes it more difficult, usually, and more challenging, and that's actually part of it, because that reflects, mimics, the actual situation that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> finds itself in in life. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a></span> is in life.

And I still think, or I wonder if still it can be hard, not easy, to understand why: why these exercises? Why are we introducing this? So I've introduced it with a few people now, just a few, and sometimes some of the exchanges and trying to explain it - sometimes a person understands immediately, but actually it's often easier when _I'm_ demonstrating something, that they seem to understand immediately<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > It seems to be difficult to understand why we are introducing those excercises" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#It seems to be difficult to understand why we are introducing those excercises" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-4

But often, after that, they sort of forget, and they veer off into something else. Something has happened. The practice has diverted, or they forget it. Something that they understood instantaneously, with me, working one on one in a room with them, and showing them something, and they just got it immediately, through me sort of giving the example with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, voice, and gesture - they seem to get it, and it's all fine, and then it just kind of veers off into something else. They've lost the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> why, or they forget, or they drag in other kind of propensities or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span> of view, etc. Or what can happen is, if I'm not demonstrating, it's actually very difficult for a person to - it _can_ be, it seems to me - understand what it is that we're talking about or why this is important<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Sometimes yogis need me to demonstrate it and or they forget it" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Sometimes yogis need me to demonstrate it and or they forget it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-5

Sometimes, working with a person with their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and voice, it can feel very alien, or they're not really sure what we're getting at, or they can't really tell the difference in two, say, movements or vocalizations they made. They can't really even tell the difference between them in the regard of what we're talking about - how much one is there, how much it's radiating and filling a space, these kinds of things. Or sometimes I might suggest to a person, "Why don't you learn to sing that song, and sing it with the full <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> and really with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>," like we were talking about in yesterday's exercises, "and with the whole presence there and being and person coming through, not held back in the voice and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and all of that stuff?<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Sometimes theres a lack of sensitivity to the energy body" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Sometimes there's a lack of sensitivity to the energy body" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^13-6

I remember, with one person, sort of suggesting - the first time I suggested the idea, saying, "Choose something like a heavy metal song or a punk song or something." And that was a misdirection in terms of the teaching I gave. It can be that genre, but actually the singer (if we're talking about singers) is actually, they're quite held back and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">contracted</a></span>, and they're not really fully in their voice, or their <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> is not really expressing things. And it might [be], at a superficial glance, it's actually quite hard to even discern it, it seems, to discern it in other people. It might _look_ like, "Well, the guy's raging around, and jumping about on stage, and he's clearly very angry about something or other," but actually there's a tremendous amount of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> and block there, and the voice is almost being squeezed out through a tiny, little hole almost<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Loud Heavy Metal or Punk voices can still be contracted" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Loud Heavy Metal or Punk voices can still be contracted" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-1

Or, say, this song and that song, and we don't recognize where this singer is actually fully, let's say, not holding back in their voice; they're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">fully inhabiting</a></span> their voice, and their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">fully inhabiting</a></span> the space that they're in, and fully reaching the audience and the physical space that they're in, and their <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span> is involved, and their <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span> is emanating, radiating the sound and the song and the spirit of the song, etc. And it can be hard for someone to realize when that's the case and when it's not the case. Two songs - it's like, good songs, they're both good singers, etc. We're talking about something else here. Or, as I said, I might try this with people, and they just, "I don't know. That didn't land. I don't think that's relevant to me. It might be for other people. I don't think it's relevant to me." Or, "I don't think I need that." Or, "Yeah, I don't know. It just doesn't interest me." That's also something that I've encountered, in exactly the people that I would really disagree with their assessment there. It's precisely a small but absolutely indispensable piece that they don't have yet, that's very relevant, that they _do_ need, that they _should_ be interested in, would be my opinion<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > There are singers whose energy is fully inhabiting the space they are in" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#There are singers whose energy is fully inhabiting the space they are in" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-2

So it's really interesting what can happen here in terms of the whole sense and view of this whole area. It can just completely pass one by, as if we just don't recognize there's anything of significance or value or personal relevance here at all. Or, for other people, it can be [alien]. I think this _was_ the case when we did those exercises in that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, which, admittedly, some of them were quite intense, and some of them were comical.

To me, this is - not just the doing of it, but also the whole sense of it, and the whole capacity to discern both its significance but also its presence or its absence, as we were just talking about in the first of these five exercises and we could talk about any of them - it's something that can be strikingly undeveloped for practitioners who, in other ways, may be very well-developed. I find that really, really interesting<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Its something that can be strikingly underdeveloped for practitioners" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#It's something that can be strikingly underdeveloped for practitioners" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-4

Again, I'm still on the 'why,' really, or aspects of the 'why.' Sometimes I'm working with someone in an interview, one to one or whatever, and it might be there's an emotion or a _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ or a frustration, or something that's there that they brought in. Maybe they weren't even aware of it when they came in. Maybe they _were_ aware of it. Doesn't matter. This emerges, this emotion, this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>, this frustration. And with the guidance, with the one-to-one guidance, they're helped to relate to that emotion, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>, or frustration so that it kind of opens something and creates something and instigates something in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and maybe as an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. Maybe both. Maybe in any order. Maybe the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> comes first, and then the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body experience</a></span>, or vice versa. Here's this difficulty, and then, with the guidance and the kind of crucibilic care that's there, something emerges or it transforms it; the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="alchemy" class="internal-link">alchemy</a></span> there allows something to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Alchemy" data-href="Alchemy" class="internal-link">transubstantiate</a></span>, really, and manifest in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body as image</a></span>. And that manifestation in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, and/or as <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, opens up in that moment a whole new <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, and also a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of the body</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Interview situation opening up to a whole new sense of self wow" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Interview situation opening up to a whole new sense of self wow" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-5

I've given different examples of that over the years in talks. That would be quite a common occurrence. But often, then, what happens is that new <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> and opened <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of body</a></span> or whatever, and capacity, etc., will revert back to the usual shapes and structures, and oftentimes that reversion happens after not very long at all. Sometimes not. But that's also quite common. When it happens, working one to one, it's quite a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Experience" data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">dramatic experience</a></span>: this sense of something <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Alchemy" data-href="Alchemy" class="internal-link">alchemically</a></span> emerging in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>, and the sort of power of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> being touched by the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, and the new <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>. It's all like, "Wow!" But the purpose here in these exercises is not so much the 'wow' and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Experience" data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">dramatic experience</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > The new capacity often reverts back to the usual shapes and structures" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#The new capacity often reverts back to the usual shapes and structures" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-1

What we have in those examples from interviews, etc., is usually a dramatic emergence of something that _does_, very understandably, trigger a kind of 'wow' response, and is a dramatic, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Experience" data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">compelling experience</a></span>. But this is not what we're aiming for here. It's more like, as I said, we're talking about _études_, or even less than _études_. Certainly in these first three exercises, they're more like just scales, or technical exercises. They're not necessarily going to feel amazing. They probably won't. I mean, they might do. I really don't want to limit things. But the point is to view them more as scales and technical exercises<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > The excercises here are more like scales and technical excercises not wow" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#The excercises here are more like scales and technical excercises not wow" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-2

On that point - and again, thinking about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pedagogy" class="internal-link">pedagogy</a></span> in a larger way - if you were to ask me, looking back over my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma practice</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span> and all that, if you were to ask me about dramatic experiences and dramatic openings, etc., that I've had over the years, I could describe many, I'm sure. I could say, "Oh, that happened in this situation, and that other thing happened in that situation," whatever it is. I could tell you about dramatic experiences and dramatic openings. But if you ask me another question, "What has made really long-term differences, in terms of long-term openings, or being helpful long-term?", the answer would not necessarily be the same as dramatic experiences<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Dramatic wow experiences do not necessarily make long-term differences" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Dramatic wow experiences do not necessarily make long-term differences" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-3
###### 15-4
I think about, for example, different, let's say, week or ten-day <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span> that I've done, and there have been a number where I could say, "Oh, yes, it was on that week <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> where I had that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. That was pretty amazing.

Actually, what seems to have made long-term differences, if I'm answering this question just for myself now, is the possibility, or when I have been able to repeat something, repeat a practice, do it over and over again - a practice on a tack that's helpful, relevant, but also has some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> for me, that's alive for me, that's growthful and that's an edge, and that therefore is interesting and exciting<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > What does make a difference is a practice thats helpful and has eros for me" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#What does make a difference is a practice that's helpful and has eros for me" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-4

So either <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on personal retreat</a></span>, or in everyday life - just every day, getting on a track, something that I'm really interested in, and repeating it, developing it, growing with it. So that would be more my answer to what has really made a genuine, long-term difference in helpful ways, different kinds of helpful ways<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Just every day getting on a track" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Just every day getting on a track" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-5

So the answers to what has been amazing, dramatic, 'wow' experiences, how much does it overlap with my answer to what has really made long-term, genuine, genuinely helpful differences? If I asked you the same question, what would you think? What would you answer? And careful not to confuse the 'wow' factor, the feel-good factor, the dramatic factor, with what makes a long-term difference. That may be something you want to reflect on. Of course, you might have a different answer. But it may be something you want to reflect on<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > How much do wow experiences overlap with what makes long-term differences" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#How much do wow experiences overlap with what makes long-term differences" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-1

I've been on other <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span>.

They were all talking, and we were talking and listening. And a lot of them, it seemed, had come from backgrounds where they were really kind of - I don't know what the word would be - they partied hard, you know, and they had very little discipline in their lives, and some of them had addiction issues, or at least that's how they would put it. And then they came on a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Goenka" data-href="Goenka" class="internal-link">Goenka retreat</a></span>, and it's suddenly almost like being thrown into a high-discipline prison sort of structure compared to their life, where there was no discipline: sit, sit, sit. They don't even walk. Just sit, sit, sit. Sit through the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, again and again and again, many hours a day, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Goenka retreat as high-discipline prison" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Goenka retreat as high-discipline prison" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-2
###### 16-3
And for quite a few of these people, it seemed that doing this ten-day, ultra-disciplined <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Goenka" data-href="Goenka" class="internal-link">Goenka course</a></span> for them really did kind of dramatically break the momentum of the unhelpful patterns in their life - the lack of discipline in their life, and the whatever else, the really hard partying and whatever. Thrown into that context of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Goenka" data-href="Goenka" class="internal-link">Goenka retreat</a></span> with all this discipline, and the pressure of that, and the intensity of that, and - what's the word? - the kind of continuity of intense effort, etc., there, made it a dramatic break, and after the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, it was enough - that dramatic break could generate a kind of momentum for their everyday practice and life to be changed, to kind of keep up a discipline and good <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span> that they felt they had lacked, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > This can break the momentum of unhelpful patterns" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#This can break the momentum of unhelpful patterns" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-3

So it may well be, then, in those kinds of cases, the drama and the dramatic 'wow' <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> - even if it's a dramatic _unpleasant_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="[experience" class="internal-link">[experience</a></span>], but oftentimes there would be a break in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> and things would get a lot easier and pleasant, if you know those kinds of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span>, sometimes - but either way, some <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Experience" data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">dramatic experience</a></span> _did_ allow and _did_ support a more long-term helpful change, and life changes as well. But in other, let's say, styles or emphases of practice, is it going to be the same? So, for example, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking Dharma</a></span> is a very different flavour of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. The whole tenor of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, the whole atmosphere, what we're doing, how we're doing it, the flavour of softness as opposed to intense pressure and effort and hard - all these kinds of things, but particularly _what_ we're doing and _how_ we're going about it, it's not the same. So it may not apply. The fact that you go somewhere, you have an <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Experience" data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">amazing experience</a></span>, "It was so beautiful, this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> on that seven-day <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>," whatever, or it could be another kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>.

"It was so beautiful. The heart was so open." Or just a _vipassanā_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. There's something that touches one deeply. Of course that's important. That's lovely. But that doesn't necessarily translate as making a long-term difference<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > In this case wow can lead to long-term change - - but how about beautiful soulmaking or metta retreats" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#In this case wow can lead to long-term change - - but how about beautiful soulmaking or metta retreats" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-4

Something to think about. And there's something for us to think about as we go forward as a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sangha" data-href="Sangha" class="internal-link">Saṅgha</a></span> with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, and again, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pedagogy" data-href="Pedagogy" class="internal-link">pedagogically</a></span>, or with regard to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pedagogy" class="internal-link">pedagogy</a></span>, to think about here. Is it necessarily that this model of week-long <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">group retreats</a></span> is really the most fertile, the most <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> in the end? Beautiful as the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of that week can be, or some of the experiences on that week can be, and touching, might it be that something more steady - courses, classes, groups, etc. - actually provide maybe not _more_ support, but a different kind of support, and a necessary kind of support for making a real, more long-term difference in terms of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">what soul needs</a></span>?

But really, again, with these exercises, to think of them more as technical exercises, like practising scales, as opposed to something that's going to create, "Suddenly I had this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Experience" data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">amazing experience</a></span> because this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> came," or this something. I mean, it might be. But that's not the point so much, and that's certainly not how to judge them. That's not the way we should be judging them. It's something like practising scales or, to shift the analogy from the musician to the instrument, it's something like, I don't know, if you had a - no, this is not such a good analogy, but if you had a piano where, let's say, these keys here get stuck if they don't get played a lot, and they just get stuck, so you end up pressing them and it makes no sound. Then you go and you're trying to play or improvise something, or play your piano piece or whatever, and you reach that note, and nothing comes out because the key is just stuck. This is a very bad analogy. But maybe if every day it had been played more, you can free those keys up so that they don't get stuck. Then they're available for the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Simile stuck keys on a piano" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Simile stuck keys on a piano" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-2

But what we're really talking about, again, is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">what soul might need</a></span>. So yes, there are some (what we could call) psychological health reasons why these exercises are a good idea, or might be a good idea for some people, in some stages of their life. But even those psychological health reasons, we can conceive them as being on a continuum with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> reasons. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> might need that kind of psychological health. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, as I said, might need for those <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="circuits" class="internal-link">circuits</a></span> to be connected and working and available, in movement, in gesture, in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, in voice<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > The soul needs the circuits to be connected" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#The soul needs the circuits to be connected" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-3

As I said, there are consequences - or there _may_ be consequences; let's put it that way: there may be consequences, all kinds of consequences, which I think are not necessarily obvious at all. Sometimes what can happen is, or another way of saying what we've been talking about is, we don't let certain kinds of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body movement</a></span> or expression, or expressions of voice and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="manifestations" class="internal-link">manifestations</a></span> of voice, we don't let that into the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, into the possibilities of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement/gesture/voice</a></span>. And it might be certain - we use that word, 'dark'; it can mean so many different things, but some of the kind of examples I've been giving in this exercise, in exercise number three - that those kinds of darker faces and expressions (and again, that doesn't have anything to do with evil; I'm not using those words synonymously at all) are not let into the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. The <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> is not open to that. The expression, the voice, the gesture, and the movement are not open to that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Sometimes we dont let certain expressions of movement gesture voice into the body" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Sometimes we don't let certain expressions of movement gesture voice into the body" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-4

Sometimes those kinds of things may come as _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>_ for a person, but it may not be enough. It may be that their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> wants _more_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> like that, or a fuller range, or more depth to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> like that, and we're only getting a trickle of what could come through. Or it may be just that the fact of having <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> alone is not enough, and I'll come back to that. It may even be that in blocking the dark <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>, somehow there's also a kind of blocking of more, if you like, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">light images</a></span>, more kind of conventionally or traditionally angelic kind of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>. And that's not obvious at all. It's because I'm not letting this dark into the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> that actually then, in my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>, there's also a block of a certain kind of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">range of light images</a></span>. We want the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">whole range of images</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a></span> wants the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">whole range of images</a></span> to be available. And remember that talk - I hope you remember it - "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="The Spreading of Five Wings" class="internal-link">The Spreading of Five Wings</a></span>," I think it's called.^[Rob Burbea, "The Spreading of Five Wings" (28 June 2018), [https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/51534/](https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/51534/), accessedAug. 2020] Again, this very much has to do with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>, and limits, and blocks, and ideas, and stuck places, and contractions. Five kinds of range that we want to check that we're open to.

So there are consequences - consequences for our formal practice, consequences for our life, consequences for <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">what soul can do</a></span>. There may be other consequences as well. It might be that, for example, in not letting some of the kinds of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, and voice</a></span> that we've pointed to in the exercises today, in exercise number three, it may be that that also affects, for example, how we are with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. It might be that in not opening up the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="circuits" class="internal-link">circuits</a></span> in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and the voice in these ways, that actually affects the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> in terms of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, and a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> that's possible then doesn't have <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and voice in it. It might also not have a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">range of images</a></span>, as we said, in it. It has a very narrow range. And in that, it might be a couple of things. It might be then that the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> gets into quite black-and-white thinking and viewing. And that's something that often goes with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> when <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> is not so healthy: it gets very black and white, the thinking and the viewing. But there may well be a relationship between the prevention, the absence, the block, the non-existence of those <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="circuits" class="internal-link">circuits</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, and voice</a></span>, and the entrenchment and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> of black-and-white thinking and viewing - even when things are rosy, and we think something's wonderful. That's just all taken as 'the truth': "It really _is_ this way. This person really _is_ that way.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Closed circuit might lead to black-and-white thinking" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Closed circuit might lead to black-and-white thinking" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^18-1
###### 18-2
We never think, "What's the connection there?" I think there's a connection between what we allow to move through, and to open through, and open in and as <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement/gesture/voice</a></span>, what's available there, there's a connection between that and something like the kind of black-and-white thinking and viewing that's really not helpful - certainly not when there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, but also when there's a kind of positive assessment of something. Even if you're praising someone, they might end up feeling a little bit put in a box that they don't feel comfortable with. You're saying this or that about them or about something they've done, but actually it's black and white. It's something entrenched. This is connected with a second aspect I want to draw a link to, because something can be brittle here. Without letting things, without opening up the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement/gesture/voice</a></span> in these kinds of ways, something can then get not just black and white in our thinking/viewing when we're angry or when there's positivity, but also then brittle<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > It can also get brittle" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#It can also get brittle" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^18-2
###### 18-3
Again, if we're talking about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> can be merely cold <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, and that's all that's available to me, as opposed to a hot, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Juiciness" data-href="Juiciness" class="internal-link">juicy</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. Cold <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> is not far from hatred, in certain ways of using those words. But cold <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> is also kind of brittle. And again, there's a kind of brittleness that can come into the being, just through the non-availability of some of these <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="circuits" class="internal-link">circuits</a></span> with regard to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and voice. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> can be brittle and not have depth to it, not have juice, not have - I don't know, I'm thinking of a spicy, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Juiciness" data-href="Juiciness" class="internal-link">juicy</a></span> curry sauce. It doesn't have that in it. There's something cold and brittle in it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > The anger can be brittle and not have depth to it" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#The anger can be brittle and not have depth to it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^18-3
###### 18-4
And then, being brittle, it easily shatters. And something shatters in the being, not in a helpful way. And something shatters in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, in what we're trying to stand up against or for, what we're trying to express and the point we're trying to make, whatever. Something shatters, and there's a collapse, a collapse in the being, and there's no strength there. So the collapse because of the shattering, because of the brittleness, because of the non-availability of these areas and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="circuits" class="internal-link">circuits</a></span> and directions and possibilities in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, and voice</a></span>, and the connection with all that with black-and-white thinking, black-and-white viewing. So this is not, I think, obvious at first. Again, I would say in some cases, I think it's significant and important, to be investigated. I certainly wouldn't insist this is the only way things work, or it works like this for everyone. Not at all. But to be investigated. This is the kind of thing we would never think to connect, these aspects<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Something can shatter in an unhelpful way" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Something can shatter in an unhelpful way" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^18-4
###### 19-1
So there's a relationship here to everything that we're talking about. There's a relationship to the question which I brought up, I think several times, but recently - gosh, now I can't remember; it might have been in the talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, on _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="In Psyche's Orchard" class="internal-link">In Psyche&#x27;s Orchard</a></span>_.^[""[[Pain, as Void and as Sacrament]]"] But anyway, somewhere, a few places in the last while, I brought up this question _I_ have, at least, about, for example, ritual, and when is it necessary. We have this question in relation to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and movement; we've had it before, long before the questions about ritual. When is it necessary for, let's say, an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of ritual to be manifested and concretized in an actual ritual<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > When to concretize an image of a ritual in an actual one 🟢" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#When to concretize an image of a ritual in an actual one 🟢" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^19-1
###### 19-2
This whole question about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> - <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, voice</a></span>, vocalization - is connected with that. When is it necessary for an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> to be manifested, concretized, as an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, or if it's an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of dancing or moving or whatever it is, to be manifested that way? And then we can break that question down into two kind of temporal levels, if you like. One is: when is it necessary for the sense and the possibility of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> in the moment? Do I open up more of a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> right now by actually concretizing a ritual gesture, manifesting it, or a movement in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> that's connected with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>? Or do I get more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, does more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> open if I don't, and I just let it brew in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> and in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-resonances</a></span>, and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a></span> remains still<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > When does an image need to be concretized in movement gesture voice" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#When does an image need to be concretized in movement gesture voice" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^19-2
###### 19-3
But then there's a second temporal level: what about the possibility of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> in one's life, more long-term? What is necessary to, if you like, open up, support the most <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> right now, in this moment, and then what about in one's life and more long-term? Enactment? Concretization? Manifestation? Or not? And it can work both ways. It's not like there's one answer to this. It's complex. It's a question. It's a living question. It's, again, back to the question of subtle <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-discernment</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a></span>, openness of being, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Whats the most soulmaking in the more long-term" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#What's the most soulmaking in the more long-term" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^19-3
###### 19-4
So two temporalities to concern ourselves with. If we're talking about - let's take the example, this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> comes. And right now, with this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, what is it that allows it to become more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>? Is it moving the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, or is it being still? Is it concretizing, or not? And then the second: what is it that allows that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> to engender and open and instigate more, the fullness, or a fuller <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> in my life, over the long term<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > 2 temporalities" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#2 temporalities" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^19-4
###### 19-5
It may not need concretization or expression, a reflection of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> or voice, but it will at least need a kind of refraction into <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="duty" class="internal-link">duty</a></span>. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> needs to be refracted somehow into <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="duty" class="internal-link">duty</a></span>. And what will _that_ need? What will that need from <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, voice</a></span>, and are they available for that? Are they open? Are the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="circuits" class="internal-link">circuits</a></span> working<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > The image needs to be refracted into duty - - are the circuits working" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#The image needs to be refracted into duty - - are the circuits working" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^19-5

There are lots of discernments, lots of questions here. And, you know, sometimes the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul may want</a></span> to express itself through <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement/gesture/voice</a></span>, but those are blocked. And they're blocked so much - this relates to what I said earlier - that a person doesn't even _feel_ the want. Those <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="circuits" class="internal-link">circuits</a></span> are so cut, there's such an absence of electric flow there (if we use that analogy), that they don't even feel the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> wanting to express in that way, through <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement/gesture/voice</a></span>. It may be that if some of these exercises <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Circuits" data-href="Circuits" class="internal-link">re-establish the circuits</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Circuits" data-href="Circuits" class="internal-link">reconnect those circuits</a></span>, then we have an actual choice. Listening is possible. We will recognize a want. And then we can choose, we can discern what's right and how, etc. Sometimes something is so cut that we don't even feel the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>'s want. If the circuit is alive, we're more likely to be able to feel the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> want, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>'s want, if there is one.

It also, of course, as always, needs me to relate, to assent, and to relate in certain ways that allow that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> to become genuinely <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, so that it has its full <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-power</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Diamond Approach impeccability" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Diamond Approach impeccability" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^20-2

So sometimes things work that way round: from the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, so to speak, by the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">grace</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, still needing our work. But other times, it's the exercises themselves which will support <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> at the two temporal levels that we talked about, so that the exercises will open the possibility of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> that are <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span>, but that come, and that feel and are <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a></span> in that time that they're around, and maybe whenever they visit after that. But these exercises may also support with the longer-term, longer arc of manifestation and opening of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> in one's life, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">refraction of the daimon</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">daimons</a></span> in one's life, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="duty" class="internal-link">duty</a></span> to the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> in one's life. The <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>, living one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>; the capacity of the person to live one's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, to really live one's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, to embody it, to manifest, to refract. So sometimes we're helped by the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span> open the territory. The <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Circuits" data-href="Circuits" class="internal-link">reconnect the circuits</a></span>. And sometimes we have to do this kind of more exercise work, and that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Circuits" data-href="Circuits" class="internal-link">opens the circuits</a></span>, and then they're open for the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>. And our practice and our life is open for <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, for the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>, for the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span>, and for our human <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">refracting of daimon</a></span>, of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, for our expressions and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">manifestations of soul</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > Sometimes angels reconnect the circuits and sometimes we excercise to open the circuits" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Sometimes angels reconnect the circuits and sometimes we excercise to open the circuits" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^20-3
