###### 1-1
Hello, everyone. There are a few things I would like to offer, so I'm making this recording, these recordings. I think usually I would probably have waited a little longer to (1) gather a little more material around these topics, and (2) to just hope that I felt a little bit more capable physically and mentally. But despite the difficulties, I think it's probably wiser not to wait, and just take this window of opportunity as it presents itself right now, as I don't know what the future will bring<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Time is short thus these talks" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Time is short thus these talks" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1
###### 1-2
So a few things I wanted to offer. And really, mostly they're kind of exercises. That's the way I'm thinking about them, like _études_, or exercises, or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span>, if you know that word that's used in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tibetan Buddhism" data-href="Tibetan Buddhism" class="internal-link">Tibetan Buddhist</a></span> circles - preliminary exercises, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries" data-href="Preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminary trainings</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries" data-href="Preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminary requirements</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries" data-href="Preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminary developments</a></span>. Of course, it's a little strange, however many years we are into unfolding the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking teachings</a></span>, to start now putting out, beginning to accrue a set of preliminary exercises, but the teachings have grown very organically and, as we grow, we kind of recognize, "Ah, this is needed. That's needed. This is what we need to add here." So, it doesn't matter. Anyway<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Études Preliminaries" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Études Preliminaries" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2
###### 1-3
I'd like to offer some, what we might call '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span>,' some exercises. Primarily, these exercises involve, centre around, movement and gesture. So the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a></span>, in movement and gesture, or the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Experience" data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">bodily experience</a></span>, let's say, in movement and gesture, _and_ voice. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Movement, gesture, and voice</a></span>. And woven into that, hopefully, I'd like to kind of include some thoughts and teachings about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="personhood" class="internal-link">personhood</a></span>, and about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> - <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anthropology" class="internal-link">anthropology</a></span>, if you like - as it's very much woven into the way we're thinking about all this<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Its going to be about movement gesture and voice" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#It's going to be about movement gesture and voice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3
###### 1-4
So, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span> at this stage of development, of the growth, the organic growth of the teachings. This is a beginning, and a beginning, at least, to this offering of this. Whatever I will offer in these talks is a beginning that can hopefully be developed. It _should_ be developed. It will naturally, _should_ naturally evoke, suggest, elicit development. And hopefully that development will be very discerning, congruent, sensitive, appropriate, intelligent. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Movement, gesture, voice</a></span> - these are huge areas, and we can add all kinds of things willy-nilly, just because we like it, or we have a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span> there, or it makes us feel good or whatever. But hopefully these kinds of exercises can be added to, and can be developed. Naturally, this is the way of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, of things that get swept up into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span>: they _will_ develop. They have to develop<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > This is a beginning which should be developed" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#This is a beginning which should be developed" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4
###### 1-5
So this is a beginning. Hopefully, they will be developed and grown, become more sophisticated, wider, further, deeper, etc., more varied. Actually, it's not even a complete beginning, because I have, and many of you will already know that there have been other teachings offered that focus on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, voice</a></span>, etc. In a way, what we're going to say in these talks, offer in these talks, adds to that thread that's already there, in fact, through other talks, through other exercises I've given out in the past, through instructions and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditations</a></span> from the past - however long it is - five years or whatever, six years. And I can't remember the names. I remember - I had a quick look before, earlier today. There were a couple of talks called "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Voice, Movement, and the Possibilities of Soul" class="internal-link">Voice, Movement, and the Possibilities of Soul</a></span>", <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditations</a></span>, exercises, instructions on there. There's something called "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="The Movement of Devotion" class="internal-link">The Movement of Devotion</a></span>", if I remember, and a couple of versions of that. And perhaps there may have been, the first one - I think I explained, "Well, I just started it all too subtle, too difficult for a first teaching.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Earlier talks 🟢" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Earlier talks 🟢" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^1-5
###### 2-1
As I said, the teachings are growing kind of organically, rather than in any linear way. Their chronological order of presentation over the years doesn't necessarily match how one would, if one was starting from zero, so to speak, to unfold the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking Dharma</a></span>, doesn't at all match that. Anyway, so there's that one ("<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="The Movement of Devotion" class="internal-link">The Movement of Devotion</a></span>"). There are even things, for example, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditations</a></span> we did - "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Hearing All Sounds as Mantra" class="internal-link">Hearing All Sounds as Mantra</a></span>", things like that, those kinds of things that we've done, where there's a lot going on. There's a lot of instructions going out. I'm asking people in the room to chant, and move, and do this and that, and interact with each other. While they're doing that, I may have been giving instructions, kind of throwing them into the space at the same time. Very understandable if a lot of those instructions didn't get so well-absorbed, taken on, if that kind of practice didn't get built on and repeated, if the principles hidden in those instructions that were in the mix of this very complex, effectively intense social situation, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditation</a></span>, new experiences, etc. - very understandable if the principles hidden in the instructions, underlying the instructions, undergirding the instructions, were not drawn out and capitalized upon and made clear. Of course, very understandable<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Instructions then were difficult to absorb 🟢" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Instructions then were difficult to absorb 🟢" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
And also, too, similarly in rituals and ceremonies that we've done, we've played with, there are often background instructions thrown in, but there's so much going on in the choreography, in the sociality and the interactions of that whole larger situation there, that it would be very surprising if those were taken on board as instructions in a way that one would actually build on them, or even recognize that there was anything there to build on or to extract. So all that's completely understandable<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > A lot was going on then" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#A lot was going on then" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
And even recently, in the last few months, I remember - I think it was in one of those online seminars; I can't remember what it was called, but it was something to do with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Engagement and Activism" class="internal-link">Engagement and Activism</a></span> - and I remember just saying something about the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a></span>, and throwing something out, and intending it really as a set of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation instructions</a></span>, but it was way too quick. Way too quick in explaining that and expecting people to actually hear, "Oh, this is a set of instructions, and I can take this and practise it and do it a lot, like I do my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Breath" data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">breath meditation</a></span> a lot." So I didn't set it up that way. I didn't take the time that way, just because there are a million other things to talk about, or it _seems_ to me there always are, so I'm always in a rush! [laughs] And similarly on the Practising the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhanas</a></span>. Actually, on the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Practicing the Jhanas (retreat)" data-href="Practicing the Jhanas (retreat)" class="internal-link">jhāna retreat</a></span>, at some point - it might even have been in the opening talk, "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Orienting to This Jhana Retreat" class="internal-link">Orienting to This Jhana Retreat</a></span>" - I did guide people very briefly through a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, etc. But again, how many people will actually take that out, and extract it, and capitalize on it, and repeat it, isolate it and repeat it as something, as a practice, as a set of instructions that are developable, remains to be seen<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Im always in a rush! 😀" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#I'm always in a rush! 😀" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 3-1
Anyway, a beginning here that will be developable. Actually, not _really_ a beginning, because it ties in with other threads that we've put out in all these different talks. In a way, following on from what I've just said, an implication (which, here, I'm going to draw it out now): one could, if one gets really interested in this stuff, go back to all those talks, and listen again, and listen to what's being said in the background, and those instructions that one might miss. Take the material out. Extract it. Write it down. Make a set of instructions. Start practising it. So there's an invitation there. Of course, that's much more work for you as a listener, or as a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sangha" data-href="Sangha" class="internal-link">Saṅgha</a></span>, than if I just offer these instructions there, and it's a separate thing, and all you have to do is press 'play' and follow the instructions. But there's the invitation<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Make a set of instructions" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Make a set of instructions" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
So, why this area? I'm going to explain more why this area around <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, and voice</a></span>. I'm going to explain more later as we go on. But it's very much connected with this idea of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span>, and what's necessary, what's required to - if we use a certain analogy - be able to fly in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking practice</a></span>, to really be able to soar on the air currents, and glide easily and gracefully and freely, to wheel around and cartwheel and manoeuvre. A lot is required. And sometimes the pieces that are required, you know, they're really obvious, like "two wings are required," whatever that analogy might be in a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking Dharma</a></span>. We need these really big structural pieces<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > We need wings to fly in Soulmaking" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#We need wings to fly in Soulmaking" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
But other times, what's required may not be obvious at all. So in this beautiful bird's anatomy, there may be a tiny, little bone somewhere, that just connects, for instance, this part, this bone in the neck, let's say, to a bone, a particular bone in the wing. It's a tiny, little bone, and the muscles are a tiny, little muscle. It doesn't seem that significant, but take it away, and maybe the bird can even still fly a little bit, but its <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> of movement, its ease, its gracefulness, its security - severely curtailed there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Whats required may not be obvious at all" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#What's required may not be obvious at all" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3
###### 3-4
So to be able to fly, we need all kinds of things, some of which are obvious, and some of which are less obvious. There are some trainings which are really obvious, and some trainings which are really less obvious. And some which are obviously very central, and some which are really not - we don't actually notice them at first. That might be something like that, as an analogy: not central, but indispensable, really, in the long run, to really have that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> to fly in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking practice</a></span>, and the whole range of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking practice</a></span>, and the whole potential range of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking practice</a></span>. Or, you know, like an airplane - similar, same analogy. You look, "Oh, it needs its engine. It needs its propellers or whatever they are, and wings, of course. It needs this and that." But maybe there's just one bolt somewhere [laughs], and it's just a tiny, little piece, but if it's missing, it's a big deal. Maybe you only notice it when you're trying to do a certain thing, like - I don't know - land, or turn around, or whatever it is. So, that kind of thing<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Not central but indispensable" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Not central but indispensable" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-4
###### 3-5
[13:09] The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span>, it should be clear to you by now from past teachings, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span> will eventually expand. Because of the way the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking Dynamic" data-href="Soulmaking Dynamic" class="internal-link">eros-psyche-logos dynamic</a></span> works, it will expand. And it will expand to include within itself, to involve within its dynamic, within its creativity and discovery, it will expand to include every aspect of our being and every aspect of our life - even more aspects than we realize exist now: "I didn't even know I had that aspect to my being, or that aspect to my life." And then it starts to come to be involved, to be <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">ensouled</a></span>, to be involved in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span>. It starts to become involved in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span>, and included. That aspect becomes included<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Soulmaking Dynamic" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Soulmaking Dynamic" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-5
###### 4-1
Just so, as the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span> expands, it _should_, it wants naturally to start including <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, and voice</a></span>. And these areas (<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, and voice</a></span>) can also be particular areas where our relationship to them is also, without us even realizing it, a little bit blocked. We're blocking something there. We're holding back something there, so that the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span> _doesn't_ naturally flow in to open them further. It doesn't actually manage to quite reach them, and we don't quite realize it. I'm going to expand on this later. So there are a number of reasons why this particular focus (<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, voice</a></span>) right now<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Soulmaking wants to include movement gesture and voice" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Soulmaking wants to include movement gesture and voice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-1
###### 4-2
But again, by way of introduction - slightly long introduction - before we get on to the material, I want to say something also about listening. It connects with something I said just now anyway. Often, when I'm teaching, I probably go too fast. I speak very quickly. For me, it feels like there's a lot to say, a lot to put in a talk. There's so much I want to share, and there's so much I want to convey, and time is limited in all kinds of ways. But often I'm aware I go very fast. Occasionally, a person says to me, "Oh, I heard your talks. It's mostly repeat." And when I hear a little bit back about what they're thinking and how they're practising, etc., it's clear that they've just missed a lot. They're not hearing a lot of details. So I actually think the opposite is true: I'm going too fast, rather than I'm just lingering a lot and repeating. What I often _don't_ do is exactly stop and give you an exercise, give you homework - especially if I'm recording, like I am now, alone at home. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">On retreat</a></span>, we sometimes slow things down. You can feel what's happening in the room, and what's appropriate, what people need there. But often I don't stop and isolate something, extract something, and point it out: "This is a set of instructions. One, two, three, four, five. Right? Do that," and set it up, and give it a name, and make it a thing. And again, it's just not very skilful teaching to expect people to do that. Naïvely, a part of me was expecting that, or has been in the past. And I just think it's naïve<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Note that Im often going too fast" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Note that I'm often going too fast" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-2
###### 4-3
So, time is still limited. I'm going to try and do exactly that: give you exercises to do, etc. But still, when you listen to this, this set of talks, when you listen to talks that have already been given - maybe by me; maybe by another teacher - is it possible to think about listening more actively<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Is it possible to listen more actively" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Is it possible to listen more actively" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^4-3
###### 4-4
**(1)** Actually, there might be a job for you, or several jobs for you to do as a listener, and one of them might be for you to **actively extract meditations, exercises, from what's being said**. What would it be to listen to talks - even, maybe, a talk you've listened to before, and you just haven't listened with those kinds of ears on: "I just sit, and I kind of hear it, and it touches me, or I kind of get the ideas, or whatever" - what would it be to put the hat of that particular job on? You're actually actively extracting meditations and exercises, number one<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Actively extract meditations excercises from whats being said" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Actively extract meditations excercises from what's being said" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-4
###### 4-5
**(2)** Number two: is it possible to **actively extract larger principles**? Sometimes these are even _less_ obvious. Of course, sometimes I'll linger a lot on a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">larger principle</a></span>, and explaining something, and why it's important, and what the concept is, and how it all fits together, and even why it's important in our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span>, and all kinds of stuff. But sometimes not, or to differing degrees. So what would it be for you as a listener also to listen at times with the hat on, listening to extract larger principles (which are sometimes less obvious)? And they'll be, as I said before, especially less obvious if I don't even bother to explain why we're doing this or that in a certain ritual or a ceremony that we've just made up, and maybe we'll just do once. Of course that's not going to be obvious. But there are reasons why we choose to do this, or why I said that - all of it. So that takes quite a lot of intelligence, perhaps, to listen that way, and try and extract those larger principles<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Actively extract larger principles" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Actively extract larger principles" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-5
###### 5-1
So two possibilities for listening at different times: (1) extracting <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> possibilities and exercises, number one; (2) number two, extracting larger principles, which may be more or less explicit. Just like the exercises, I may make a very light suggestion, maybe explicit, but I just touch on it so quickly. It may just be implicit in what I'm saying, okay? So there's an invitation. Maybe think about doing that sometimes, experiment with that kind of listening. I taught a recent <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> at <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a></span> on the theme of the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a></span>_, _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice, and one of the things I mentioned there was about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>, and our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span> as practitioners, as students of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, but also as human beings. I would have, had there been more time, spent a lot longer really exploring that theme of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>, and really asking people to inquire into where does <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>, how and where and in what ways does <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span> operate for them - in the way they relate to their practice, in the way that they practise, in the way that they listen, in what they practise and how they practise, all that. To me, there's a huge, really, really important inquiry there, but I just mentioned it on the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and sort of pulled back from giving people too much to do. Even though we had three and a half weeks, it still felt like it would be a bit much. But in my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, it felt actually really, really important<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Example the concept of inertia" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Example the concept of inertia" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1

[21:14] Still on this theme of listening, recently Nic and Sarah were listening to some talks, a set of talks, and they were listening together, as people sometimes do. And they decided - I don't know if they decided, or it just spontaneously occurred - that they would listen, and then they would sort of ask each other, "Oh, can I press 'pause' for a sec?" And they would pause. Someone would press 'pause.' They would say, "Okay," and press 'pause.' And one person would say, "Should we just do that practice he just mentioned?" And sometimes it was just that I was implying a practice, as I was saying, or just mentioning it. It wasn't only that they pressed it when there was an actual <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditation</a></span>, that I would say, "Ah, now I'm going to do a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditation</a></span>." "Okay, let's do this." So they were really listening in quite a different way, and being together enabled them to listen in that way. They actually got into a kind of mode of listening where they were pressing 'pause' quite a lot, or pressing 'pause' to stop and actually discuss something that they'd just heard, or question something, if one person didn't quite understand, or just questioned, "That can't be right," or _da-da-da-da_, whatever<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Listening to talks together" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Listening to talks together" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2

Sometimes a talk, a two-hour talk, I have no idea how long it ended up taking them to listen to, but it certainly sounded like they were having a lot of fun doing it that way. Maybe it was _more_ fun. I don't know. Maybe other times, of course, it's much more fun doing it on your own and listening right through, straight through, without interruption. Maybe they were digesting more, assimilating more. So there's a question. But we can have, for instance, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="active listening" class="internal-link">active listening</a></span> modes, if we call that '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="active listening" class="internal-link">active listening</a></span>,' as well as <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Active listening" data-href="Active listening" class="internal-link">receptive listening</a></span> - to differing degrees, just letting it kind of come in, without interrupting, without turning the soil, stopping to turn the soil. But what is it to till the soil, to till the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>? It _will_ need tilling at some point, the soil of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. Whether that's actually while I'm listening, or after, at some point it needs that, and that cannot happen without you being active, and without you taking some kind of initiative and responsibility, and making choices, and being intelligent, sort of listening - I think I said on a recent <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> - listening on the tip of your toes or at the edge of your seat. "On the tip of your toes," I think I said<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Receptive listening tills the soil of the soul" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Receptive listening tills the soil of the soul" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-3
###### 5-4
Similar goes for reading. Some people - unfortunately, a surprising amount of people - sort of make it clear that they read _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Seeing That Frees" class="internal-link">Seeing That Frees</a></span>_ without doing any of the practices, or without really spending much time at all on any of the practices. To my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, it's like, how much can you hope to really get out of it? There's not the working of the soil enough. And even reading it just too quickly, that particular [book] - lots of books are, and lots of books aren't, but that particular book is very dense. There's a lot there. "Why _that_ word? What does it mean? What does it imply? What does it suggest about my practice? What does it suggest about what I'm thinking and how what's being written or said might be a little bit different, or even a lot different from what I'm actually thinking?" So anyway, just this question about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>, and in this case, an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span> about how we practise. Also an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span> about how we listen, or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span> in regards to how we listen. We get stuck in certain <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Active listening" data-href="Active listening" class="internal-link">modes of listening</a></span>, certain modes of reading. And it takes a bit of work to push ourself out of that particular kind of groove or rut, basically, that we're in. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Inertia" class="internal-link">Inertia</a></span> in physics takes work to overcome. It takes force to overcome<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Seeing That Frees is often read too fast without doing the practices" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Seeing That Frees is often read too fast without doing the practices" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-4

Again, there can be an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span> regarding what we hear, and what we read, and without even realizing it, we actually end up hearing and end up reading what we already think we know. I'm actually just chopping off, shaving off, just literally not hearing or seeing what doesn't actually fit into what I think I already know, and so I end up just reading something that's, in fact, quite different, or quite challenging to what I already know, but I think I've just read something that's completely confirmed it, or just has said what I already know in different words<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Listening with blinders on" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Listening with blinders on" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-1

So there are all kinds of possibilities here for kind of energizing and bringing some _oomph_ and some electricity and some fire and some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, some more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, really, into the listening and reading. All kinds of possibilities. There's also the question, when we're listening and reading, about - and this is related to what I've just said - we can't help listening and reading (and I think this is just the way <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> needs to work) without kind of, usually unconsciously, having a process where we're determining or trying to determine, judging the significance of this or that thing that we're hearing right now. So here's a talk. It's an hour or whatever it is, two hours or whatever. "This part's not that significant. _That_ part's significant." Or here's something I'm reading, whatever. So this, I think, is just natural to the way we need to listen as human beings, to structure, to make sense of what we're listening [to] or what we're reading: "What is the significance of this? How much significance does it have?<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Listening is automatically sifting for significance" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Listening is automatically sifting for significance" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^6-2

Some of what we're going to get into in this offering, this series of talks - I don't know how long it'll end up being - some of these exercises, they will not seem, or they probably will not seem that significant. So I'm going to say that right now: they probably will not seem that significant. But it's a bit like that tiny, little bone at the bird's shoulder, that just connects the wing, or one little bone in the wing, and set of little filaments of muscle in the wing, to a small bone or another bone in the chest, whatever it is. It doesn't seem that significant. Or that bolt in the airplane. Some of these exercises won't seem that significant. We can tend to think, especially with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking practice</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>, "Well, if there's an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, especially if I get a clear <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> and a clear sense of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, _that's_ significant." But if I'm just doing something, and there's no real moving or gesturing or voice or something, there's no real <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, it may not seem that significant<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > So be careful that topics might be not central but still are significant" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#So be careful that topics might be not central but still are significant" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-3

So something can _seem_ to have more impact, and it can certainly _seem_ to be more to the point of and in line with what <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span> is. Obviously, if there _is_ an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> and we're impacted, it can _seem_ that that's more significant. But in the long run, it may not be. You might think, "Oh, it's a 'wow' <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>." Maybe in the long run, it was just some 'wow,' and I definitely felt impacted and affected, and it was beautiful and everything, but in the long run, it may not be that significant. Just the fact that we talk about <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>, you think, "Well, obviously <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> must be significant." It may or may not be, relatively speaking. Sometimes it's hard to really be that wisely discerning in assessing: what actually is significant, and what is its significance? Hard. It's hard for us. All this is very normal<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Wisely assessing significance is hard" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Wisely assessing significance is hard" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-4

I think I remember at some point using the phrase - I can't remember how often, or even when it was; it feels like a long time ago - using the phrase 'structural listening.' Can we listen to a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> talk structurally, or read a book - like, for example, _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Seeing That Frees" class="internal-link">Seeing That Frees</a></span>_ - structurally? Again, very, very rare. Very rare to have that capacity to kind of listen for the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">larger structure of ideas</a></span>, and the sort of way it all hangs together, and the progress of ideas there, the larger <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>. What would it be to actually develop that capacity as well? That's a training. That's a big deal. As I said, it's very rare. What would it be to listen or read _for_ and _from_ the whole <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>? I'm listening _for_, or I'm reading _for_, to get a sense of, what is the whole <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>. And then, when I think I have that, I'm listening _from_ the perspective of the whole <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>. And that listening _from_ an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of the whole <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>, holding it there, it frames my listening - whether it's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking Dharma</a></span>, that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>; whether it's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> or mainstream <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, whatever it is. That frames my listening, and creates a kind of meta-view from which I can then discern with intelligence. I can then discern. It helps me to discern <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conventional reality" data-href="Conventional reality" class="internal-link">the relative</a></span> significance and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conventional reality" data-href="Conventional reality" class="internal-link">the relative</a></span> place of this or that thing that I'm hearing, or this or that instruction, or this or that word, even, that I'm hearing right now, or reading right now<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Structural listening" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Structural listening" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-1

This is hard. Or rather, it's very rare. It's rare for someone to have that as that's normally the way they go about things. It does exist, but it's very rare. It can be trained. Listen, read, for and from the whole <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>. In the end, it ends up being a lot _less_ work to do things that way, because things are ordered, because the very <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span> tells me where things will be. It informs me about what I might do in practice at any moment. It suggests. It tells me how ideas fit together, so they're not just a random sort of, "Here's another idea. Here's another idea. Here's another one," and I've just got this pile of stuff to sort through, random sort of objects - all of which, or most of which, maybe look a little interesting or glistening or kind of curious or whatever, instead of this big structure where they fit together and I can understand where things are, etc. Because I understand where things are and how they work, I can find them a lot easier. Things make sense. They're more accessible. I can make choices a lot easier, a lot more intuiltively eventually, and a lot more intelligently, a lot more helpfully<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Because I understand where things are and how they work I can find them a lot easier" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Because I understand where things are and how they work I can find them a lot easier" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-2

Even just now, up to now, we've thrown out this idea about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>, and this question. It's like, actually taking on this question, this inquiry: where's the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span> for me in relation to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma practice</a></span>, how and what I practise, in relationship to how and what I study or hear, or how I listen? Where's the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>? And how does that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span> balance with a need for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span>? I actually need to stay with something for a while. Then I can get too entrenched in something. So all this inquiry into <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>. Now, I would say that that inquiry into <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="inertia" class="internal-link">inertia</a></span>, even though we're not really going into it at the moment [laughs] - again, I'm postponing it, or just mentioning it; I don't know if I'll ever get back to it - I would actually say that's _more_ important as a teaching, as an inquiry, structurally it's more important, at the meta-level it's more important than anything else that I might say in this set of talks about movement and gesture or anything else<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Wheres the inertia" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Where's the inertia" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-3

What I think was much more important for most people (and if it _wasn't_ during those three and a half weeks, it _will_ be at some point, or it will have been at some point), much more important than all those little bits of really valuable technique was the whole relationship with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice being a goal-oriented practice.

And it's a subject that's going to pertain to any other <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma practice</a></span> I do, pretty much, and loads of stuff that's outside of my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation practice</a></span>, just pertaining to my life.

A little bit more introduction, actually, if you can stand it: as I said, I will hopefully unfold more about the 'why' of these exercises - why I am offering them now, why I'm emphasizing them now. That, as the talks unfold and the instructions unfold, I hopefully will include. I intend to include more about the 'why.' But just to say right now: of course the 'why' of these exercises is related to the 'why' of practice in general. It has to be, right? Of course. The larger question of why I'm practising informs the smaller question of why these exercises: "Why practise these exercises? Why might they be important?" The 'why' of these exercises is related to the bigger 'why' of, "Why practise? Why am I practising?" It has to be, of course.

Our ideas about why we practise, and our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasies of path</a></span>, goal, self, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>, etc., will have massive consequences, certainly in our practice, at every level of our practice, and also beyond our practice, in the rest of our life. And one of the questions, then, is: do we realize it? A second question is: do we realize that these ideas and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasies</a></span> can be limiting? They can also be nonsensical. So we can end up with a sort of conglomerate of ideas and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasies</a></span> about the 'why' of practice, and what practice is, and where we're going, that actually don't really make sense together. They're not very coherent. They're also limiting. That's possible. That's very, very possible. They will _always_ have consequences. The question is: do we want to unlimit them, if they're limited in an unhelpful way? Do we want them to be coherent and to make sense, if they don't actually make sense once we start looking at them, and questioning them, and prodding them a bit? Which, often, we don't. Often practitioners _don't_ really. We've talked about all this before in other talks. There will always be consequences. I have to realize that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Do we want to unlimit them if theyre limited in an unhelpful way" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Do we want to unlimit them if they're limited in an unhelpful way" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-1

I remember teaching in another country. This was quite some years ago now. And I was talking with a woman. I can't remember the context. I don't think it was in an interview. It was either before or after the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, or some other situation. It may have been <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span>; I can't remember. Anyway. She said to me, or to a group of us (I can't remember), "My husband doesn't need to meditate." She was probably in her late sixties then, is my guess. I could be wrong, but I'm assuming, and it sounded like her husband was a similar age. "My husband doesn't need to meditate." I don't know if she elaborated on that, but certainly my ears pricked up at that point. "My husband doesn't need to meditate." She may have said something like, or what she then said implied that what she meant was, "He's already calm. He's already kind of a very steady character and calm," or something like that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > My husband doesnt need to meditate i e is already calm" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#My husband doesn't need to meditate i e is already calm" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-2

And of course, implicit in that was her view that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> was the point of and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">goal of meditation</a></span>, and that's why she was coming to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and that's why her husband didn't need to, because he was already calm and steady. I think that the situation wasn't such that I was in the teacher role at that point. I can't remember the situation exactly, but it didn't seem appropriate for me to ask a question in response, or probe that a little more. But to me, it was very clear that she was holding a very limited idea of what she was there for <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span>, what she hoped to get from <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>, what <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> was for. And this was, in fact, borne out by other interactions I had with her and things that I saw<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Thats a limited idea" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#That's a limited idea" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-3

Now, that's fine, if that's her view, or rather, if that's her thoroughly investigated view, and that's where she arrives at, freely and independently: "This is all I want <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> to be. I know there's this option, and that option, that option, that option, and that option as well, but I actually just wanted to be calm and steady, because I've looked at my life, and looked at everything else, and all the other things, either I can get them elsewhere - I can understand the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> elsewhere" - which is highly unlikely, of course, but - "or some other kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> I can get elsewhere, whatever it is, or they're just not things that I'm interested in." But my sense was that she hadn't actually thoroughly opened up that inquiry, and so there was this quite small area delineated for the range and the purpose of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> and all that. And you could also, as I said, pick that up in other ways, in terms of her responses and reactions to teachings that went beyond that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > It maybe would not be if it was a thoroughly investgated view" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#It maybe would not be if it was a thoroughly investgated view" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-4

Or, "They have just unshakeable _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>.

Or, "They have incredible <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. This or that happens, and they're just really steady."

Very different situation: I remember talking to other people, and being in very different <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> backgrounds, and this woman I described who had been basically, also, to be fair, trained in from the beginning a presentation of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> that didn't actually present the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> as much more than that. So that's what she had been taught the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> was. She was trained in that. Very different <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> scene I'm thinking of. Different teachings. Sometimes people get into, again, certain ideas about what they're doing, certain <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasies</a></span>. The idea, because obviously the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> has to do with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">liberation</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>, and "therefore it has to do with not struggling." And if we're into something called '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">non-duality</a></span>,' then just drop the struggle right now, and don't struggle in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>.

Or that idea, together with the idea - and it often goes with, I would say, narrow ideas of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">non-duality</a></span> - "Don't deal with concepts.

All these kind of things. Then out of that comes a kind of mode of practising - effectively a technique (although one tries to think of it as _not_ a technique, because one isn't struggling, or supposedly not struggling and doing, and not thinking, etc., and it's non-dual). The idea is that it's open, but actually, it ends up being very closed, because we've cut off a bunch of possibilities: no struggling in any way at all. No thinking. We have to conceive, but only a little bit of conceiving is allowed: it's that conceiving isn't allowed, and try and be non-dualistic, etc., whatever that means<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Dont deal with concepts" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Don't deal with concepts" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-4

What that also means, if we link it to other <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasies</a></span>, is that there can be very little art, because there's very little doing. There's a shrinking of options. There's a shrinking of the possibilities for creation and discovery. It's not this infinite range and expanding sort of playground of creation/discovery, of artistic possibilities. Practice just ends up being almost like one thing. In all this rhetoric and convincing ideas and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> about openness and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">liberation</a></span>, etc., it actually ends up being quite narrow, just doing the same thing over and over. It's one thing, and it's not really leading anywhere, except to the same thing over and over. So what's supposed to be open ends up being quite closed, or closing possibilities, closing the possibility of art in the larger sense there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > There can be very little art when we are doing very little" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#There can be very little art when we are doing very little" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-5

Anyway, it _is_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Elitism" data-href="Elitism" class="internal-link">elitist</a></span> in the sense that probably - well, let's say it the other way round: I think that (and again, picking up the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> analogy a little bit) maybe a better <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, maybe a better way of thinking about what we're doing, let's say, when we're teaching <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking Dharma practice</a></span> (or we could actually say even teaching _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice or whatever), a better way of thinking about it, rather than the usual way, which is, "This is to do with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">liberation</a></span> from <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. This is to do with at least reducing <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. And as such, as a teaching about the reduction of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> or reduction of stress, it's for everyone and available to everyone. Therefore, we want teachings that anyone can apply and anyone can understand, and it's really important that they're accessible in that way.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Soulmaking is elitist" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Soulmaking is elitist" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^12-1

So there's a kind of legacy we get from the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Four Noble Truths</a></span>, which is that, basically, "This is for reducing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>," if we kind of water it down a little bit and just say _reducing_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. There's a legacy we get from that. Of course, it's a wonderful legacy we get from the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Four Noble Truths</a></span>. It's so rich and so brilliant as a teaching, and so powerful as a teaching. I've talked about that lots before. But it's actually a mixed blessing, this legacy. It has a shadow side, and I've talked about that as well. And particularly it has a shadow side when, in this day and age, we start to question: what does a reduction in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> actually _mean_? And what does it look like? And how noticeable is it at different levels? When we've kind of done away with the universality, or there is no more a universality of belief that the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">end of suffering</a></span> is the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Rebirth" data-href="Rebirth" class="internal-link">ending of rebirth</a></span>, then what exactly do we mean by 'ending <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>'? We've been into all that before<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > The legacy of the Four Noble Truths" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#The legacy of the Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-2
###### 12-3
But with all that, despite the massive confusion there, what actually do we mean by the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Four Noble Truths" data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Third Noble Truth</a></span>, and by implication, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Four Noble Truths" data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">First Noble Truth</a></span> (and of course, the second and the fourth, but principally the first and the third)? What do we mean by '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>'? What do we mean by 'ending <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>'? In the kind of swamp of confusion that has come with that, in the aftermath of this kind of dropping of a universality of what that looks like - whether it's even a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Theravada" data-href="Theravada" class="internal-link">Theravāda</a></span> universality, or a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a></span> universality or whatever - and then, coupled with that, that because it's reducing <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, it somehow needs to apply to everyone. It needs to be equally applicable to everyone, and accessible and everything. That model, it brings with it all kinds of issues and problems. It brings with it its own sort of stumbling blocks and limitations<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Suffering is not universally applicable to everyone and everything" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Suffering is not universally applicable to everyone and everything" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-3

Sometimes, and more recently, I'm thinking, well, why not just conceive the whole thing like <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music" data-href="Music" class="internal-link">music school</a></span>, or art school? And we teach all levels at this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music" data-href="Music" class="internal-link">music school</a></span> or art school - from beginners (never even put my lips to a recorder or whatever it is, never even banged on a drum with my fingers, whatever it is, shook a rattle). We teach all levels, and we teach right from that beginner level all the way - there's no end to it, in fact. There's no end, where we stop that. We can just keep going in this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music" data-href="Music" class="internal-link">music school</a></span>. But we understand: only some of the people who will want to take up <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span>, and come and learn, and play, and develop, and practise, etc., only some of them will have a really <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">deep desire</a></span>, or that really <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">deep desire</a></span> to just play at the highest, deepest, freest levels. Of course, only some people will have it. In that sense, it's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Elitism" data-href="Elitism" class="internal-link">elitist</a></span>. It's up to you. So, if 'elite' is etymologically related to 'elect' and 'choose,' it's _your_ choice. It's your choice how far you want to go. Everyone will be challenged by something, or in relation to something, within that whole range of what's possible there in practice and development. But it's your choice, and your choice about what you <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, and how far you want to go, and how much you want to develop things<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Elitist means to have the desire to play at the highest deepest freest levels" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Elitist means to have the desire to play at the highest deepest freest levels" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-4

That would be an example. Yes, it's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Elitism" data-href="Elitism" class="internal-link">elitist</a></span>. No problem. What's the problem with being <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Elitism" data-href="Elitism" class="internal-link">elitist</a></span>? It's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Elitism" data-href="Elitism" class="internal-link">elitist</a></span> in the same way that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music" data-href="Music" class="internal-link">music school</a></span> is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Elitism" data-href="Elitism" class="internal-link">elitist</a></span>. It's not refusing anyone entry. It's just saying, "Yeah, but if you want to do _that_, then you need to do _this_ first, because otherwise you won't be able to do that. We can teach you this, and after you do that, then yeah, let's talk about the other thing, if that's what you really want." Sometimes, or more recently, I've just thought that's a much better model. But we're hampered a little bit and tied to this. We keep thinking about words like '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">liberation</a></span>,' and 'ending <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>,' or 'reducing <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>,' and then there are all kinds of other accretions that go with that, particularly around <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Elitism" data-href="Elitism" class="internal-link">non-elitism</a></span> and accessibility and "it's for everyone," all this stuff. It might just be simpler to change the analogy<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > There is no problem with being elitist" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#There is no problem with being elitist" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-1

[1:03:48] This is all still introduction, by the way. [laughs] I want to extend the analogy, the musical analogy. It gets a little limited here. Or rather, extend one thread of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> analogy. There are limitations to any analogy, and it'll be clear here, but I think it's useful. I'm speaking about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> because obviously that's something that I have, as you know, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span> with, so I know that whole area. I was, well, different kinds of musician at different times. I was a composer, but before that, I was a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music > Jazz" data-href="Music#Jazz" class="internal-link">jazz</a></span> musician, and I studied <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music > Jazz" data-href="Music#Jazz" class="internal-link">jazz</a></span>, and worked to develop the art of improvising on the guitar in sort of different <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music > Jazz" data-href="Music#Jazz" class="internal-link">jazz</a></span> idioms. It was something that I was completely dedicated to and put an enormous amount of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> into. So I'll use that as an example. And, you know, sometimes what happens is, what you've got there in, let's say, learning to improvise <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music > Jazz" data-href="Music#Jazz" class="internal-link">jazz guitar</a></span>, is you've got a lot of different skills and arts within one thing. Learning to improvise <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music > Jazz" data-href="Music#Jazz" class="internal-link">jazz guitar</a></span>, improvising <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music > Jazz" data-href="Music#Jazz" class="internal-link">jazz guitar</a></span>, it's a lot of different skills and arts. It's not one thing. It's many, many. And again, it's just open-ended and it's infinite in the possibilities there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Example Rob playing the Jazz guitar" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Example Rob playing the Jazz guitar" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-2
###### 13-3
Sometimes what happens, if you really get into all this stuff and give yourself to it, sometimes there's a sort of sudden growth of ability, like of what you can do, what you can play or create or improvise, and you're not even quite sure how that sudden jump of level happened. Of course, it comes out of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. It comes out of loving what you're doing, and loving that whole area, and loving the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span>. And it comes out of listening, and listening with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, and listening with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> to other musicians and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> you <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. It comes, of course, out of playing. And it comes definitely out of practising. So it comes out of all those four things. But it's not necessarily the case that I practised X, and then I was able to _do_ X. Of course, sometimes it _is_: I practised X, and then, eventually, I was able to do X. Great. So now I can do X. It's added to my playground. It's added to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> that I have to create and discover musically in the moment<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Sudden growth of ability" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Sudden growth of ability" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-3
###### 14-1
But other times, I don't practise X. Sometimes I don't practise X, and I'm somehow able to do X by some way; I don't even understand how it happened. Probably more often than not, I don't practise X, and then I'm never able to do X, whatever X is. It will never appear in my playing. It will never appear in my creating/discovering, my improvisation, etc., because I never practised it. I could talk a lot about this, but I want to keep it short. You know, I'm looking at <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> now, and look back at my life and think, and realize, you know, there's one <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>. I think there's one <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>. I've obviously been in and out of lots of different <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span> and situations, and all kinds of things. And for me, there's one <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span> in my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> that I think I will take with me to my grave. It feels like a deep <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-grief</a></span>. And that is specifically around - how can I say this? - not developing certain things in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music > Jazz" data-href="Music#Jazz" class="internal-link">jazz guitar</a></span>, my ability to do certain things to a level that I would have liked - a level of virtuosity and fluidity, specifically, that I would have liked. Specifically, it's about technique, actually. I don't know; maybe that sounds very weird to some people, to look back at a life, and [they] think, "Well, that's a strange thing to have <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span> about." I don't know. But to me, that's what it is, and as I said, as far as I can tell, it's the one thing, and it goes very deep for me. It's a real <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-grief</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Soul-grief from not practicing being fluid" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Soul-grief from not practicing being fluid" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-1
###### 14-2
And in a way, there's a story behind that. I did develop all kinds of abilities on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music > Jazz" data-href="Music#Jazz" class="internal-link">jazz guitar</a></span>, and some very sort of rare abilities, I would say, and abilities to do things that are really quite rare. Other things that were maybe less rare, or more sort of obvious-seeming, I never got the chance to develop. And the reason I never got the chance to develop them was partly - well, mostly because they weren't taught, okay? There was no one at that time. There is now, however many years later - thirty years later or more; more than thirty years later. There are now people teaching electric guitar technique with a plectrum, with a pick. But back in those days, it wasn't really taught. So I went to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> conservatories and college. No one could teach that. They could teach it for every _other_ instrument, because all those other instruments had hundreds of years of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span> behind them for people to figure out, "How do you teach piano technique so that people can be very fluid and fly that way?" But on the guitar, it seemed like no one really - if they could do that, they didn't really know how they figured it out. It was something they just stumbled across, and they didn't even realize quite what they were doing. They never put it under a microscope. It just worked, so they went with it. But a lot of people didn't, couldn't actually do that stuff, really, to the level that _I'm_ talking about<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Fluidity wasnt taught then" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Fluidity wasn't taught then" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-2
###### 14-3
So I wasn't alone in this boat, and I had to kind of make do with what I could do, and kind of work around my inabilities, my incapacities. I feel really good about that. But there's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span> here, you know? And it has to do with just, again, this deep, unfathomably <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">deep, visceral desire</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">vocation</a></span>, for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> to come through, which was then not able, not enabled to be fully physically manifest. I'm going to say that again, because I'm not just telling a story here; this is really key to what I'm talking about in all these talks: it was not enabled to become fully physically manifest. Not enabled to become fully physically manifest. It was never explained to me. I couldn't find anyone to explain, to teach me those things, which, on other instruments, would be completely basic - completely, like, "Well, this is just part of how you learn the instrument - exercises, etc." So there's a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span> for me there. It's too late to go back. And I eventually gave up the guitar, got more into composing, partly because of that, because I felt the limitations, partly. I eventually gave up that, and became a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma teacher</a></span>. So who knows? Had I had available to me that enabling and that teaching of that technique, and was enabled to fully physically manifest that degree of musical creation in improvisation, maybe I wouldn't have taken those other steps, and I wouldn't be giving this talk today. I wouldn't be a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma teacher</a></span>. But that's also been very wonderful, of course. I know that you know that. And I feel very much that's, of course, part of my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a></span> too<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > It was not enabled to become fully physically manifest" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#It was not enabled to become fully physically manifest" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-3
###### 15-1
Anyway, the point here - actually, there's lots relevant here. But for this talk, there's one main reason for sharing this, and it's about this: exercises that allow something to become fully physically manifest, that enable that possibility, those possibilities. So just as there are lots of, as I said, elements or techniques and capacities and abilities that go together to make up being an improvising <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music > Jazz" data-href="Music#Jazz" class="internal-link">jazz</a></span> guitarist, there are many that go to make up <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma practice</a></span>. There's lots in there, and there's lots even that go to make up <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking Dharma practice</a></span>. When we come to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking Dharma practice</a></span>, when we come to wanting to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">live a life of soul</a></span>, we can hope that, "Well, I'll just practise, and I'll just <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> all this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> business, and I'll listen to the talks, and I <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> them for the most part, and I play, and I meet with friends, and we play <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> together," and all that stuff, and it may be, or I can _hope_ that it opens possibilities. And it _will_ open possibilities. But the question is, will it leave some possibilities not opened to me, to my practice, to my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking Dharma practice</a></span>, but also to my life, and my life in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, and my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> in life<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > There is hope that practice opens possibilities" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#There is hope that practice opens possibilities" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^15-1
###### 15-2
[1:13:44] So we can hope, and maybe it will to a certain extent, but maybe not. When we talk about exercises and techniques, they're not everything. Some of you will be musicians. You know that. You're playing a scale; it's not really <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> yet, you know? And some of these things that we're going to talk about, they're not necessarily even <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. I mean, they might be. But like that bone in the wing of the bird, or near the wing of the bird, or like just the ability to do certain things, they're crucial. They're absolutely crucial. They're not everything, but they're necessary for <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span>. They're necessary for the fullness of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, the fullness of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> formal practice, and the fullness of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> in one's life, and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> in one's life, and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> through one's life, and life in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Some of you will be Soulmaking musicians" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Some of you will be Soulmaking musicians" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-2

Okay, that's the end of the introduction. [laughs] What I want to offer is five exercises. And 'exercises' means they're for practice, which means, in this sense, like doing technical exercises on the piano or whatever it is, or this scale. The point is repeating them, maybe gaining facility through the repetition - not just something to do maybe once or twice, but actually doing them until you really don't need to do them any more. They're not necessarily <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, as we've just said. They won't necessarily, these exercises, bring a kind of sense of a 'wow' <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, or some kind of dramatic shift in anything: "Suddenly, I was doing this thing, this exercise, following the recording, and suddenly there was this shift." They won't necessarily - they _might_, but they won't necessarily do that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Five excercises" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Five excercises" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-3
###### 15-4
So five exercises. There's no prescribed order, I don't think, between these five. But, as I said, I'm regarding them as <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span>, in a way. I hope you can get a sense of what I mean by that. So even if you're well into <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking Dharma practice</a></span> by now, they will still be good to add, I think, and to explore. No prescribed order. They form part of what we might call a set of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span>, or might, hopefully, again, develop into a set of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a></span>. We'll talk about other ones more later on. As I said, I want to explain more about the 'why' as we go through<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > There are a lot of variations" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#There are a lot of variations" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-4
###### 15-5
Okay. So five exercises, no prescribed order. I need to choose to start, so I'll start with one which I'll call exercise number one, but not because it's really number one. We're just calling it that. And it's a movement exercise, okay? All of them have <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement, gesture, and voice</a></span>, and some of them are a lot more complex. This starts relatively simple, relatively simply. Okay, exercise number one. Now, immediately you're going to hear there are lots of variations possible. So there are five exercises, but lots of variations within each exercise, because _this_ exercise can be done in two ways, okay? It can be done as an actual physical movement. Your actual <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a></span> is moving, and someone else in the room can see that you're moving. Or it can be done just with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and the imagination, and there's no physical movement. Okay? All the different variations within this, exercise number one, can be done either physically, or just in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and the imagination, without the physical movement. Between these two possibilities - <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a></span>, or just <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> - there isn't an order, or I don't think there's an order. Try. If you're going to do these a number of times, at least, I hope, then experiment with different orders: first the physical, and then not, and then the other way round<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Excercise 1 can be done with the physical or with the energy body" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Excercise 1 can be done with the physical or with the energy body" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-5
###### 16-1
Okay, so two large camps: with physical, and just the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>. Also, then, starting in four postures. So already we've got eight variations, right? I haven't actually started yet. Four postures: sitting, standing, walking, and lying down - the four classic postures of the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Satipatthana Sutta" data-href="Satipatthana Sutta" class="internal-link">Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta</a></span>_. That already leads to eight. And then the actual parts of the exercise, we're going to say there are five. [laughs] Actually, even more. But you can see, just already, proliferating variations. I could [do this] just in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, standing, or physical movement starting in the walking posture, okay? They're **different variations** of these different kind of categories of choice, if you like. One category, whether it's **physical or** whether it's just **<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>**; the second category, **which of the four postures you're going to start in**. As an example, let's say you start standing<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Excercise 1 can be done in 4 postures" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Excercise 1 can be done in 4 postures" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-1
###### 16-2
[1:19:50, **exercise one** begins] ^16-2
###### 16-3
Then there are five parts of the exercise, okay<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Excercise 1 has 5 parts" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Excercise 1 has 5 parts" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^16-3
###### 16-4
**(1.1)** The first one is, you adopt your starting posture, and you feel the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>. Let's say it's standing. You adopt the standing posture, and you feel your <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> in that posture. Then you feel or imagine the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> extending to fill the room that you're in, so that it touches the walls. This isn't something we would always want to do with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> at all. Usually we talk about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> just a little bit bigger than the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a></span>, but here, with your primarily kinaesthetic imagination, you're feeling, imagining your <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> extending to fill the room and touch the walls of the room, and the ceiling, and the floor, etc. What does that feel like? Maybe there are some visuals to it, but primarily, you want it kinaesthetic. That's the first thing. You're just standing, and you're imagining doing that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > 🟡 Excercise 1 1 fill the room with the energy body" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#🟡 Excercise 1 1 fill the room with the energy body" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-4
###### 16-5
**(1.2)** Second (so this is the second of five options), you begin to move. You have to really take your time working through these. We really want the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. The intention here (I'll repeat this at the end) is sensitivity to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, and in this case, also the projected or expanded <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and the space you're in. So really feeling a sense of sensitivity to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, the sensitivity to the expanded <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, and the kind of inhabiting or filling of the space you're in. That's the intention. It's primarily about sensitivity<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Its about sensitivity" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#It's about sensitivity" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-5
###### 16-6
Okay, so you've adopted the starting posture. You've expanded. And you're feeling that. You've extended the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, and you're feeling that. Second, you start moving your hands and your wrists and your arms - slowly, just in an improvised way. Move your hands and wrists and arms any way you want, and feel your <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, and feel (and again, sense, imagine) the, so to speak, imagine the space - as if, like, you're pushing water or air, whichever you're doing, as you move. You're pushing the air or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> in the room. Or just imagine you're standing in a swimming pool or floating in a swimming pool, and you're alone in the swimming pool, and just the movement of your arms is going to send ripples out. The movement of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> will just automatically send ripples out through the space, through the water there in the pool, and they will reach the sides, and then they will bounce off, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > 🟡 Excercise 1 2 move hands and feel it in the energy body" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#🟡 Excercise 1 2 move hands and feel it in the energy body" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-6
###### 17-1
We're not just talking about the space of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. We're not just talking about expanding the space of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, okay? That's a different practice. We're talking about an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body sense</a></span> - expanding, moving, and feeling, sensing and imagining not just the space of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> in its usual size, but also the extended sense of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> in the room, and how that's connected with and impacted by and filled by the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> of your <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> movements. It's more than just the space of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. We're talking about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> sensitivity here. Of course the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> must extend, if we're going to do this exercise, from, for example, the palms of my hands to the walls. So actually, I first have to have that much expansion of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. But we're saying more than that. Then it's this sense, imagination, felt, kinaesthetic sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, through the movement, in the movement, with the movement, initiated by the movement, propped up by the movement, occupying, filling the whole space. The second part of this is your hands, your wrists, and your arms. Remember, this can be done physically; it can be just in the imagination with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, [and] there's no obvious physical movement there. It could be done from the standing posture. It could be done from the lying down posture, from the sitting posture. There are all these variations, okay? Spend some time doing that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > The kinaesthetic sense of energy fills the whole space" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#The kinaesthetic sense of energy fills the whole space" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-1
###### 17-2
**(1.3)** A third stage is to then move your head and neck. Now, you could stop moving your hands and arms and wrists, and _just_ move your head and neck, but the same thing - the same <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, the same sensitivity, the same expansion, the same kinaesthetic sense and imagination and feeling extending there. Or you could make it kind of cumulative, so now you're moving your hands and wrists and arms _and_ your head and neck, freely, improvisationally. Same thing - the sensitivity, the imagination, the projection, the inhabiting, the filling of the space<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > 🟡 Excercise 1 3 move head and neck" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#🟡 Excercise 1 3 move head and neck" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-2
###### 17-3
**(1.4)** And then, fourth stage, to add your legs, your feet, your ankles. They can start moving, slowly, improvisationally. And again, that could be everything else becomes still, and you just move them, or you add that to the other areas of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> that are already moving<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > 🟡 Excercise 1 4 add legs feet ankles" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#🟡 Excercise 1 4 add legs feet ankles" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-3
###### 17-4
**(1.5)** And then, a last stage: improvised movement including all the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span>, all the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. So the hips, pelvis, everything. Okay<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > 🟡 Excercise 1 5 add hips pelvis everything" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#🟡 Excercise 1 5 add hips pelvis everything" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^17-4
###### 17-5
[1:26:37] Lots of variations in there. Lots of possibilities in there. The intention is the sensitivity to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> in the usual-size sense, but also to the much more projected, the larger size - the projected, expanded <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, and the whole sense, if you like, of the space that you're in, and of inhabiting and filling that space with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, letting the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> project to fill that space<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > let the energy body project to fill the space" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#let the energy body project to fill the space" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-5
###### 17-6
Another variation is that actually we can do the same thing with faster movements. I would probably start it slower, because there's much more chance of the sensitivity. This really _does_ take a lot of sensitivity. This is the prime intention of this exercise - actually, a lot of these exercises. It's the sensitivity. Not all of them, but for this one. And actually, the capacity to expand, the capacity to project and not always be held back. I'll talk more about this later<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Variation start with slow movements then faster" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Variation start with slow movements then faster" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-6
###### 18-1
But when you've done this a little while, or when you've done this a few times, then you may want to experiment with faster movements. And it may well be that doing it faster is much more tricky to maintain, and really tune in and feel, and have a good kinaesthetic sense or imagination there. But see. See what happens. And if it's too fast, then you can just slow it down till you can find what does work, or maybe just stay with the faster a little longer, because maybe it will come alive. So that's the first exercise. You can see: lots of different variations there. I'm not going to repeat that, because you can just rewind and listen to it again<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Faster is much more tricky to maintain" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Faster is much more tricky to maintain" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^18-1
###### 18-2
[1:28:43, **exercise two** begins] ^18-2
###### 18-3
Okay, second exercise. I realize there are lots of variations, but relatively speaking, it's pretty simple. It gets maybe a little more involved later on in the exercise. The second exercise is a ==voice exercise==. So the first one is really movement, we could say. The second one is a voice exercise. Again, broadly speaking, we can do it two ways: we can do this voicing, making an actual sound that's audible to ourselves and to others, or we can do it only imagining making a sound and feeling that in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> (so with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body sense</a></span>; there's not a physical sound, and neither is there physical movement here). So two ways of doing it again, and two ways of doing any element of it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Voice excercise again physical or imagined" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Voice excercise again physical or imagined" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^18-3
###### 18-4
What we're going to do here is you're going to sound extended tones, extended notes - vowels, probably, or syllables, or they may be mantric syllables. In this exercise, it doesn't matter which. It doesn't actually matter that much which sound, or if it's a mantric syllable, which one. It doesn't matter for these purposes at all. You make an extended [sound]. You hold a note for a long time. Not till you're out of breath, but just the idea is long notes. And within that, you have notes, at different times, higher notes or lower notes. So use your whole range. Use your full range, however high you can go, however low you can go. It's not directly to do with stretching that range, but eventually it may be connected with that. But use your full range, without being uncomfortable - high and low<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > long notes full range" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#long notes full range" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^18-4
###### 18-5
**(2.1)** First thing to notice is, where in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> is the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centre of emanation</a></span> of this sound that you're making right now? Can you notice and feel? At the same time as you're, again, let's say you're standing there doing this, you're still feeling your <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a></span>, as we do pretty much any practice - feeling the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a></span> as at least a background. You've still got there that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body awareness</a></span>. But where in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> is the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> of the emanation of the sound? Can you notice, and can you feel that? Any trained singer, at least, anyone who sings really should be aware of this: different pitches will feel like they're coming from different places in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. A very high pitch comes from actually higher in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, or feels like it does - the top of the head. Right from the top of the head to the pelvic bone is the usual place where a singer will feel, or someone voicing will feel, is the sort of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centre of resonance</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centre of emanation</a></span> of the sound. First thing is, can you just notice and feel where it's coming from, within that range, from the top of your head, the crown of your head, to your pelvic bone, right down to your perineum? You've got the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body awareness</a></span>, and then you notice where the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> is<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > 🟡 Excercise 2 1 Feel where the sound is coming from against energy body background" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#🟡 Excercise 2 1 Feel where the sound is coming from against energy body background" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^18-5
###### 18-6
**(2.2)** Then, actually, is it possible to include the arms and legs, and the possibility that the sound may - or _can_ you feel; it's just a question - can you feel it as also emanating from your arms and legs as well? Can it come from the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a></span>? And again, usually <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> is bigger than the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a></span> a little bit. Do you notice that it's easier to feel and to sound from certain places than others? Not so much hit the note, but to feel the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centre of emanation</a></span> and be comfortable with it really emanating strongly and surely and full-bloodedly and embodiedly from that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span>? Over time, you might notice, "Oh, it's kind of like the lower belly, it's hard for me to really inhabit that, and fill it out, and let that really be a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span>. Something's - I don't know - blocked. Is it? Or just not available there? I don't know what it is." I don't have to figure it out, but just to notice, whereas something up in the throat is much more possible, or a higher note; other people, the other way round. Notice. And maybe, over time, with practice, it might be that the whole range becomes more evenly available, that the sound that you're sounding, that the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> is sounding, can emanate full-bloodedly, full-bodiedly, with full presence and full _oomph_ from any place in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, and you're comfortable. It doesn't feel like somehow it's a bit of a dead spot, or it's hard to get a feeling there or whatever. Okay, so that's the first part of this second exercise. It's five parts. Where in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> is the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">centre of emanation</a></span> of the sound? Actually, I've already mentioned the second one, which is: can I have the sense of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a></span> emanating<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > 🟡 Excercise 2 2 experiment with different centres of emanation" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#🟡 Excercise 2 2 experiment with different centres of emanation" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^18-6
###### 19-1
And again, this is something that I'm almost certain that I've thrown out at different times. I'm pretty sure I encouraged it in the instructions when we were doing the "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Hearing All Sounds as Mantra" class="internal-link">Hearing All Sounds as Mantra</a></span>," when we were doing that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditation</a></span>. You think, where's your voice coming from? "It's coming from my mouth and my throat," right? But what is it to really feel - let yourself imagine it at first, but have a kinaesthetic imagination, a felt sense, of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a></span> (which, again, means a little bit bigger than the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a></span>), the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a></span> emanating that sound? It's really coming from that whole space. Okay, so that's the second part of the exercise<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Energy body as centre of emanating" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Energy body as centre of emanating" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^19-1

**(2.3)** The third part of the exercise: can the sound that you're making, and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">sense of the energy body</a></span>, feel like they're mixed together (to quote from the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>) "like water in milk"?^[SN 36:19 https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN36_19.html] So they're not exactly the same thing, but once you mix them together, it becomes almost impossible to tell them apart. They're not going to separate like oil and water. Can you sense, get a kinaesthetic sense, and an aural sense as well, of the sound and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> mixed together, almost impossible to separate them apart? They almost become palpably the same thing. The sound _is_ the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, is vibration. The vibration is the sound. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> _is_ sound, has become sound, has become vibration<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > 🟡 Excercise 2 3 mix sound and energy body" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#🟡 Excercise 2 3 mix sound and energy body" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^19-2
###### 19-3
**(2.4)** Okay, fourth part of the exercise: we've got this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, as usual, and we've got the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> of the sound, of course. And, to add to it, similar to the first exercise, a sense of the space around you, and the waves in the pool, the ripples in the pool around you. Now, actually sound _is_, in fact, waves in the air. That's what actually makes sound. Sound is waves in air. What is it to have the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body awareness</a></span>, to have the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> of the sound, to be really in that, and open to that, and sensitive to that, and then also open the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> to the sense of the space around, the sense of the medium, if you like? And imagine, feel, hear that medium resonating with the sound, filled with the sound. That sound, that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> that _you_ are sounding, that's coming through you, is filling the space, is reaching the walls. Can you get a kinaesthetic, felt sense, a kinaesthetic <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>/imaginative sense, hearing it and feeling it as reaching the walls, the ceiling, the floor, etc., filling the space<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > 🟡 Excercise 2 4 hear the space filled with sound" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#🟡 Excercise 2 4 hear the space filled with sound" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^19-3

**(2.5)** We sometimes think, "Oh, well, I need to get louder." Not necessarily. So here's a little sub-variation. Sometimes it's good - get loud. Let yourself get loud, because sometimes (and this is very related to one of the reasons why I'm doing this) people really hold themselves back from being loud. I'll return to this. Sometimes let yourself get loud as part of filling the space. But you can also have this sense of filling the space, of projecting with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and the sound, and letting it fill, and letting it fill and impact and shape and flow through and penetrate the medium when you're not necessarily getting louder, even in a big room. It still feels like, you're imagining even, that it's projecting. You're feeling it as projecting and filling the room<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > 🟡 Excercise 2 5 be louder or not" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#🟡 Excercise 2 5 be louder or not" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^19-4

[1:39:23] So that was actually - again, I've said it - this is the fifth variation: sometimes to do it loud, and sometimes to do it soft. I've run through because I elided some of them together. Remember, all this can be with sound, or just with the imagination and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>. Extended tones, doesn't matter what. High and low pitches, different pitches over your whole range. First part: where in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> is the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> of the emanation of the sound? Can you notice that? Can you feel it? Whole tip of the head to pelvis. And then, actually, include more, and see: where is it easier? And what happens over time to that sense of where it's easier to have that sense of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> of the emanation? Second part: can you have a felt sense, a felt imagination, of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span> emanating, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span> radiating sound that way? Third part: can the sound and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> become mixed? The vibration, the resonance, and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> become mixed like water in milk, like milk in water. Fourth part: with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and the sound <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> of sound, can we also feel, imagine, hear, get a kinaesthetic and aural sense of the whole medium of the space that we're in, and the whole space that we're in resonant with that sound, filled with, filling that space with the sound and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, reaching the walls, etc.? And fifth: can we do that both loudly and softly, but it still fills, expands, radiates<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > Summary of the excercises" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Summary of the excercises" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^20-1

Okay. So I'm going to stop there now, and go through the other exercises in another part. As I said, these are relatively simple, but still, I think, really worth doing. They may sound completely boring or pointless to you. Hopefully I'll explain more about why they're important. But I hope that's clear enough for now. We'll stop there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1 > The excercises are relatively simple but still really worth doing" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#The excercises are relatively simple but still really worth doing" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^20-2
