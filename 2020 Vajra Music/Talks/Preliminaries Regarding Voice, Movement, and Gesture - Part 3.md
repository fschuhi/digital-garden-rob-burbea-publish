<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
 And I find more and more these days, when things are difficult, when there's challenge different ways, that the sense (and I mean that word in its double meaning: the sense, the actual [[perception]], and the idea) of my human being or another human being is more along the lines of this [[Image|image and analogue]], of having [[Dimensionality|angelic dimensions]] which are refracted into the human life more or less at different times, with a [[duty]] to that. <br/>
</div></div>

##### Finding in one's core the self, or stillness (Aspect 4)
<span class="counts">**[[0303 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#^3-5|3-5]]**: _[[Centre]] (10) · [[Dharma]] (3) · [[The Self]]_</span>
<div class="admonition important"><div class="title">Interesting</div><div class="content">
Think about this "Dharma 101" view of not being able to find a self anywhere (and therefore certainly not in the centre).<br/>
</div></div>

<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
One could think about centring as, "I need to centre because I need to encounter that self at my centre." Or it could be that what I'm expecting at the centre is a kind of infinite depth of still nothingness, of stillness and nothingness - which is a wonderful sense: one can look inside, and there are different kinds of nothingness, different kinds of stillness. <br/>

##### Looking deep inside myself, I encounter nothing

<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
This angel, in the mystery of their being, in the mystery of this angelic constellation, this angelic relationship, this angel is both other and self. But it's [[Divinity|theophany]]. It's a face of the divine. It's an expression of the divine, which is different than an [[emptiness]]. An emptiness is not a theophany. An emptiness is usually construed as an essence, usually construed as a transcendent essence beyond all attributes. A theophany is a face, ... a being in itself... <br/>
</div></div>

##### We have to delimit
<span class="counts">**[[0303 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#^5-3|5-3]]**: _[[Daimon]] (3)_</span>
<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
We have to delimit; we're not just open for any old ideas about angels and all that business. That's why I said the words, the concepts, are pointing us in a direction, and pointing us along a road, but that road is infinite. It has boundaries. It's not like _anything_ can fall under the scope of that road...<br/>

They're not living and choosing in their life in ways that really stretch their [[soul]] or that open them to kind of soul-risks, if we might use that phrase. There's nothing really on the line. And they might be stretched in all kinds of ways - might be very busy, might be stretched doing something very helpful in the world, whatever, but it's not actually a soul-stretch, and there's no real risk there. And maybe it's that the [[Daimon|angels]], the [[Imaginal|imaginal figures]], the daimons, don't need and won't choose someone who is not willing to stretch - stretch themselves, stretch their lives, stretch their soul.<br/>

### "Soul"
##### A teacher said: "I don't really relate to the word 'soul'"
<span class="counts">**[[0303 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#^7-2|7-2]]**: _[[Soulmaking]] (2) · [[Soul]] (4) · [[Dharma]] · [[Ways of Looking]] · [[Fabrication]] (2) · [[Insight]]_</span>

<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
Oftentimes it's the 'making' that people don't relate to, the word 'making.' Of course, if you understand the whole track of exploration of [[ways of looking]] and [[fabrication]] ('fabrication' is just another word for 'making'), and how that deepens, and how it opens out, and the understanding it opens out, then the word 'making' is almost an indispensable word in 'soulmaking.' But for a lot of people, it's very puzzling, because you'd usually think of the word 'soul,' or have a sense of soul, or use that in a very reified way: it wouldn't be something that we _make_. It would be something that _is_, or we discover, or that just is a level of being or whatever.<br/>

There's a mystery in the kind of impossibility of finally dividing them up as one or two, this being that I'm encountering, this being that I'm sensing with soul. ...

You're taking it to another level, really, dropping any idea of an attempt to express or convey any meaning, something that _could_ get put into words, or an emotion. You're not conveying or expressing an emotion, or an [[image]], or an event, or a story, or my story, or your story, or whatever it is. There's just [[Embodiment|movement, gesture, and voice]]. And dropping any sense of an attempt to express something with that, to convey something that _means_ anything with that.<br/>
