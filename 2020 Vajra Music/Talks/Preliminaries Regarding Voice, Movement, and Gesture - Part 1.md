##### So be careful that topics might be not central but still are significant

<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
What would it be to listen or read _for_ and _from_ the whole conceptual framework? I'm listening _for_, or I'm reading _for_, to get a sense of, what is the whole conceptual framework.

And that listening _from_ an understanding of the whole conceptual framework, holding it there, it frames my listening...<br/>

Now, I would say that that inquiry into inertia, even though we're not really going into it at the moment [laughs] - again, I'm postponing it, or just mentioning it; I don't know if I'll ever get back to it - I would actually say that's _more_ important as a teaching, as an inquiry, structurally it's more important, at the meta-level it's more important than anything else that I might say in this set of talks about movement and gesture or anything else.<br/>

Then out of that comes a kind of mode of practising - effectively a technique (although one tries to think of it as _not_ a technique, because one isn't struggling, or supposedly not struggling and doing, and not thinking, etc., and it's non-dual).
