So letting the movement/gesture/vocalization shape the action in time, as it goes, playing it by ear, so to speak, or creating the pottery, whatever you're making on the potter's wheel.

[W]e're letting that intention lead us, and just starting the movement, and kind of reading it, surfing the whole situation, responding with our receptivity, with our sensitivity, responding to what we sense in terms of the [[Soul|soulfulness]] and the blessingness, and letting that shape the movements, the gestures, the vocalizations we're doing. So we're letting the body and the [[energy body]] and the sense of the soulfulness in the moment guide the movements, the gestures, the vocalizations...<br/>

The meaning of this and the dimensionality, or the meaning of this and the sensing with soul of what's opened up through the meaning of what's being said in my voice, but also the dimensions that are opened up just through the sound, through the [[music]] of it, the mystery of it, the miracle of hearing and of sound. This particular sound, right now. This particular music. Different than other musics. Unique, particular.<br/>

##### In 4.1.x there is still meaning, in 4.2 we are opening up dimensionality and go beyond meaning

##### Witness is just noticing (albeit by bringing the whole energy body into sensual relationship) 🟢

##### Just noticing - it doesn't have to be this or that
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^5-3|5-3]]**: _[[Experience]] · [[Energy Body]]_</span>

---
##### In case of feeling uncomfortable, the blesser is allowing themselves to pause, sense the space they're in (Method 1)
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^5-4|5-4]]**: _[[The Self]] (2) · [[Energy Body]] (3) · [[Embodiment]]_</span>

<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
Allowing yourself to stop, pause, and sense, and taking the pressure off that way, but remaining attentive and connected and alive and attuned to the experience of self, other, world, energy body, and emotional body. And then, perhaps, out of that, out of that sensitivity and attunement in the pause comes the instigation, the seed of the next movement or gesture or [vocalization].<br/>
</div></div>

---
##### Just keep going (Method 2)
<span class="counts">[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^6-1|6-1]]</span>

<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
You're not taking your hands off the clay on the potter's wheel.<br/>
</div></div>

##### Also for Method 2, sense what you're doing

##### I'm just tuning in and sensing as it rolls along, and I follow, soulfully
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^6-3|6-3]]**: _[[Embodiment]] · [[Soul]]_</span>

<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
I'm letting the material shape the creation, rather than the sort of pause in the inner sense and silence.<br/>

#### Self-judgement
##### There might be self-consciousness arising
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^6-4|6-4]]**: _[[The Self]] (3) · [[Embodiment]] · [[Fear]] (3) · [[History]] · [[Soul]] · [[Mindfulness]] (2) · [[Anxiety]] (3) · [[Consciousness]] · [[Awareness]]_</span>

<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
The mindfulness expands to include that: "Oh, okay. There's self-consciousness going on as well. There's a bit of [[anxiety]], or even a lot of anxiety about looking silly or whatever it is, or sounding silly." Can there be a bit more space in the consciousness? Because anxiety will contract the space of the [[awareness]]. Sometimes just creating a bit more space can help.<br/>
</div></div>

---
##### Opening up counteracts the contraction that's inherent in self-consciousness

---
##### Sensing anything with soul also counters the contracted self-consciousness
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^7-4|7-4]]**: _[[Perception]] (2) · [[Dyad]] · [[Soul]] (6) · [[Contraction]] · [[The Self]] (2)_</span>

<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
Because when there's sensing with soul, it will tend to counter that kind of reified and [[Contraction|contracted]] [[The Self|self-consciousness]], self-obsession, because that's not really a soul-movement. It may be a kind of squeezed, impoverished reflection of what's, if you like, originally a soul-movement, but in itself, it's not. So when we sense with soul, something opens that out.<br/>
</div></div>

##### Place the affliction in the sight of the angels

#### Variation on Excercise 4
##### Rather than actual person, dyad partner is intrapsychic image

<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
You're doing this in dyadic relationship with an image. Same thing though: you take your turn to move the body and make gestures and vocalize to the [[Daimon|angel]], to your angel who is your dyad partner, to the image there, to the [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]]. And then you receive, in your imagination, the movements, the gestures, the vocalizations, the [[blessing]] and just the mystery of that communication from the angel, in your imagination.<br/>
</div></div>

##### Move/gesture/vocalize physically concretized, or just in the energy body

##### Less chance of self-consciousness arising if we do it with an imaginal dyad partner (Reason 1)

<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
So we really want to keep that range of things, the more subtle range, open, and keep exploring it - not at the exclusion of the grosser, but just a reminder that sometimes the more subtle is actually the more powerful and the more fertile and the more profound.<br/>

---
##### Can increase the range of what we're doing (Reason 3)

<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
Usually when the intention goes into that kind of thing, that's when I'm seeking information; usually that information is for the sake of a reified self, and what this self can get, or how it can aggrandize itself in some way. (...) The fullness of intention is a much more powerful, much more primal, fundamental, beautiful, sacred intention than these other intentions that are more to do with a reified self, and power, and what it can get, etc.<br/>

Now, okay, so here's a certain personality, a certain kind of style of expression. Certainly it's not to imply that the only way to stand firm is in a quiet and serene way. I don't want to imply that at all. But if this is the kind of iconic moment we're drawing on or we're focusing on for this part of this exercise, then that's actually part of the [[image]], that it is quiet and serene. So maybe you can get a sense of that, of what would it be to sense into that whole, the whole [[Gestalt Psychology|gestalt]], the whole configuration of that whole moment, that whole image, that whole time, that icon, that iconic moment, and then see how that wants to be mirrored or refracted or expressed with the body [[Embodiment|movement, gesture, voice]], or what wants to manifest or express in response to that or from that as a seed.<br/>
