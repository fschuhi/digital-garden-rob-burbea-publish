### 🟡 Exercises 4.2 revisited

=> [[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#0303 Preliminaries Regarding Voice Movement and Gesture - Part 3 13-4 13-4 🟡 Exercise 4 2 2nd part]]

##### The question "what does blessing look like" is culturally contingent (Mode 1)
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^1-1" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^1-1" class="internal-link">1-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">Blessing</a> (4) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">Dominant culture</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Before I introduce exercise five, or a fifth set of exercises, I'd like to say a bit more about exercise four, a few more things there, and add a possible variation for exercise four. Let's say a few things. Given the instructions for exercise four in the first part, with <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a>, it would be quite normal, perhaps, and certainly understandable, to sort of hear that, hear those instructions, and think - even if it's not a sort of very drawn-out, discursive thinking, but something like think in the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, "Okay, what does <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a> look like? Or what does <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a> sound like? What would that look like as a movement or gesture, or what would it sound like?" So there's a kind of process that's instigated by the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, maybe by past associations with <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a>, if we have any (because <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">in our culture</a> it's not a word that's in common currency any more, that has much currency outside of certain narrowing circles).</span>

##### "Blessing" in different traditions
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^1-2" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">Blessing</a> (6) · <a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a> (3) · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">But maybe we think, "What does <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a> look like?", and we draw upon past associations from here or there or whatever. So perhaps putting the hands on the head - in some traditions, that's part of how one blesses. One places one's hands on someone's head, and utters a <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a>, confers a <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a>. Or in other traditions, one sometimes marks a cross, a crucifix, a small crucifix on the forehead of the one blessed. Or just gestures in the air, marking the crucifix. All these very beautiful gestures from other traditions. Or I might think, "What does <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a> look like?", and it occurs to me there's a bowing involved. That would be a very understandable connection to have made, association to have. Or the hands in _namaste_, in prayer pose, pressed together. Or, for instance, the hands and the palms tracing over the <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a>, or even larger than the <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a> of the one blessed, and sort of conveying, conferring the <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> of <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a> through the hands, over and into that space, penetrating the <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a>, the <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> field, the being, with <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a> through the hands and through that tracing of that movement.</span>

##### Out of a traditional idea come particular movements, gestures, vocalizations
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^1-3" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">Blessing</a> (4) · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So in thinking, so to speak, if we use that word, 'thinking,' "This is what <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a> looks like or sounds like," out of that thinking and those associations, etc., comes the movement, the gesture, and/or the vocalization. All that's really great. And in a way, I think when we've done rituals and ceremonies on past <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a>, for example, and included these kinds of instructions with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Blessing" data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">blessings</a>, etc., that this is part of what's gone on for people, and it's wonderful, and it's beautiful, and it can be very, very powerful. But it's possible, or just to open up the recognition or the possibility at times, also, of the propulsion and the instigation of the whole <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement or gesture or vocalization</a> not so much coming from an idea. Not so much an idea leading to an action, an idea of <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a>, an idea of what <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a> looks like, or associations, etc.</span>

---
##### But the word "blessing" can also be a seed which can be blossom intosoulful direction (Mode 2)
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^2-1" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">Blessing</a> (3) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> (4) · <a data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">Imaginal</a> · <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a> · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So yes, that has its place, but just to invite, to open up a space for a possibility of a slightly different way of entering into this intention, that's starting, for instance, instead, just with the intention of <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a> - even if I'm not quite sure, as I said in the last talk, what that actually means for me. Let it be an open word. Go with what I've got. Let the word itself be a seed. Who knows what will germinate, what will sprout from that seed? Just start with the intention of <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a>, and just start moving, gesturing, vocalizing, whatever it is, depending on which part of the exercise you're doing and the instructions. So there's the intention, even if it's not quite clear what that exactly means, that word, '<a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a>,' for instance. And just start moving, with the intention. Just start moving, and almost like with the incorporating the feedback, so to speak, from the movements, from the gestures, from the vocalizations that you're doing. So sensing, as you're <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">moving/gesturing/vocalizing</a>, sensing: does this feel <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a>? If I do this, does it feel _more_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a>? If I do that, does it feel _less_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a>? So just as we do with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking practice</a>, a part of one's <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> is very attentive, refined, careful <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> on the sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a> in the moment, and what is supporting that, and what is not supporting that; where it opens and blossoms and grows and deepens, and where it shuts down a bit or gets a bit flat or narrow.</span>

---
##### Just start with an intention and just start moving with that intention
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^2-2" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> (4) · <a data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">Blessing</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So it could be the sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a>. It could, again, be the sense of <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a>, or both, of course. What you're really doing is you're just starting with an intention, and just starting moving with that intention. And whatever actions you're doing, whatever <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movements/gestures/vocalizations</a> you're doing, you're almost receptive to, attuned to, how that feels in line with the <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a>. ==So letting the movement/gesture/vocalization shape the action in time, as it goes, playing it by ear, so to speak, or creating the pottery, whatever you're making on the potter's wheel. Creating it as you're going, through the feel of it, through the feedback you're getting, through the signals of <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a> and of blessedness and blessingness that are coming back to you.== Slightly different than starting with an idea, and then kind of replicating that idea, and perhaps then not putting so much <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> on what feels <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a>, what doesn't feel <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a>.</span>

##### What helps to be in Mode 2?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^2-3" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a> · <a data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">Imaginal</a> · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> · <a data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">Blessing</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">They're both good, but I just really want to open up that space for that possibility, that second possibility. If we do it that second way, or if at least some of the time we're in that second mode, then a couple of things: one is, what helps me be in that mode? It's quite difficult. It's actually quite difficult to dance, for example, and really be sensitive to the sense of soulmaking, in terms of the genuine, authentic imaginal, and all the elements, and all that sensitivity. It's actually quite difficult to do. So what would support it? One thing - it may or may not be; you'll have to find out - do I need to slow down? Do I need to slow the whole movements down, for instance, or pause in between movements, or what? What's the kind of rhythm that allows me to read, to sense, to be attuned and receptive to the sense of soulfulness in the moment, and whether it's being opened and supported or closed and not supported, the sense of blessing?</span>
- slow down the movements
- pause in between movements
- rhythm

<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
What's the kind of rhythm that allows me to read, to sense, to be attuned and receptive to the sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a> in the moment...<br/>

##### It's just like doing walking meditation (pacing)
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^2-4" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^2-4" class="internal-link">2-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> (3) · <a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a> · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> · <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a> · <a data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">Blessing</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So what pace do I need to go at? It's just like doing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">walking meditation</a>, doing _any_ kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">walking meditation</a>. There's always this question: what pace should I walk at that, right now, most helps whatever <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> I'm trying to do, whatever <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a> I'm engaging in that walking posture? So one is a question of pacing. It might be slowing it down. It might not be. I don't necessarily assume it is. But sometimes going slower allows us, affords us, a greater sensitivity, a greater attunement and a greater reading of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a> and the sense of <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a>, the sense of <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a> that's there. So that's one thing that may be important.</span>

##### Is it possible to let go of "oh, it's silly"
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^3-1" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^3-1" class="internal-link">3-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> · <a data-href="Dyad" class="internal-link">Dyad</a> · <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">A second may just be - and this goes for so much, of course - to the degree that we're judging ourselves in the moment, that will usually, almost always, shut down my sensitivity, my capacity to notice the sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a> and blessingness in the moment. By conventional behaviour in our society, all this is pretty strange, some of these exercises, and this one in particular may be very strange. And then you're doing it in a <a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a>, so there are all kinds of reasons it would be quite normal and expected for <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> of judgment or self-judgment to arise: "Oh, it's silly," or whatever it is. "It looks silly. I'm not getting it. I'm not doing it very well," whatever it is. Is it possible to just let that go? Is it possible? It's a question. I'll come back to that, actually, a little bit later. But to the degree that there's judging there, self-judging there and <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> of judgment from another, to that degree it shuts down our sensitivity, generally speaking, but also in this particular exercise, and the kinds of sensitivity we need in this particular exercise.</span>

##### Leaning into Mode 2

<span class="paragraph">[10:53] But this second way of doing it, we're sort of just focusing on the intention, planting the intention, letting the intention instigate and lead our actions - even if the intention is not fully comprehended by us: "What does blessing mean? What does it mean to bless someone? I don't know, maybe, or I only know a little bit," or whatever it is. But in this second way of doing it, or second leaning, let's say, second emphasis, then we're letting that intention lead us, and just starting the movement, and kind of reading it, surfing the whole situation, responding with our receptivity, with our sensitivity, responding to what we sense in terms of the soulfulness and the blessingness, and letting that shape the movements, the gestures, the vocalizations we're doing. So we're letting the body and the energy body and the sense of the soulfulness in the moment guide the movements, the gestures, the vocalizations - at times, at least. Seeing if it's possible to lean into _that_ mode more, sometimes at least, more than the other mode, which is almost like a preconception, an idea, a notion, a memory, an association of blessing and what it looks like or sounds like, an idea of what movements, gestures, and vocalizations convey blessing. So both good, both fruitful, but see if you can sometimes get a sense of moving between those different modes, or at least between those two different emphases, let's say, because it might not be so black and white.</span>

##### We usually use voice to communicate something
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^3-3" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^3-3" class="internal-link">3-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">As I said, this is quite a strange exercise from the perspective of conventional <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understandings</a>, and the way we conventionally understand what the voice is, etc., and how we use the voice, for example, or how we communicate. Usually, of course, we use the voice, and we think of the voice as an instrument, a vehicle, through which, by which, we share or communicate something. And that usually implies describing something. Through our voice, we share, communicate, and thus describe what I'm feeling, or my story, or something that happened, or an idea, or an <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, or whatever it is. That's usually the way we relate to how we use the voice, and what the voice is: we're communicating something through trying to describe it, to represent it, re-present it.</span>

##### Mantras also don't necessarily have particular meaning either
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^3-4" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^3-4" class="internal-link">3-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Mantra practice" class="internal-link">Mantra practice</a> (3) · <a data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Avalokiteshvara</a> (3) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (5) · <a data-href="Seed syllables" class="internal-link">Seed syllables</a> · <a data-href="Om mani padme hum" class="internal-link">Om mani padme hum</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">And even, often, sometimes when we're doing <a data-href="mantra practice" class="internal-link">mantra practice</a>, or we introduce a chanting, and we kind of hear - okay, this is the mantra, we learn the melody and the syllables or whatever, and a part of us is thinking, "Okay, what does it mean?" Or if not "What does it mean?", "What's the character of this mantra? Whose mantra is it? Which deity does it belong to? Ah, it's (for example) <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Avalokiteśvara</a>." Then I know. Then I know it's invoking <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, because it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Avalokiteśvara</a>. So in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mantra practice" data-href="Mantra practice" class="internal-link">chanting of the mantra</a>, or the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mantra practice" data-href="Mantra practice" class="internal-link">reciting of the mantra</a> or whatever, I'm invoking, I'm thinking - I'm obviously concentrating on the sound, etc., and the voice, but I'm invoking the meaning of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, even if those syllables, I don't know what they mean. And some of them don't actually mean anything. They're <a data-href="seed syllables" class="internal-link">seed syllables</a> that don't have meanings. Others are kind of seed meanings as well in different mantras. But anyway, oftentimes we as Westerners will want to know, "Well, who am I invoking?", so that when I'm chanting the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Om mani padme hum" data-href="Om mani padme hum" class="internal-link">Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ</a>,_ and it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Avalokiteśvara</a> or whatever, "Ah, yes, <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. Okay." And part of me is thinking about the meaning of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. Again, I don't mean a lot of discursive thought, but I mean the whole vibe of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, and I realize, "That's what this mantra means."</span>

##### What if the sound itself was sensed with soul?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^4-1" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^4-1" class="internal-link">4-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">Blessing</a> (3) · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Now, of course, that's not _wrong_. It's not wrong at all for a mantra, and it wouldn't be wrong for the first part of this exercise, exercise four, where the intention _is_ towards <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a>, and letting that word, '<a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a>,' be soft and elastic and expandable. But what if the sound itself, as sound, was sensed with <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a>? Not to do with its meaning. This is where the second part of the exercise comes in. It may be there already, coming through, and predominating even at times, in the first part of the exercise where there _is_ the <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a>. So some sound itself, sensed with <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a>. We're moving towards a jungle of sounds, a landscape of vocalizations - mysterious, because not necessarily meaning anything, or at least, not _just_ meaning anything.</span>

##### There is a level of (the sounds of) my voice that transcends meaning
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^4-2" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^4-2" class="internal-link">4-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a> · <a data-href="Music" class="internal-link">Music</a> · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> (3) · <a data-href="Unfathomability" class="internal-link">Unfathomability</a> · <a data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">Dimensionality</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">I've said this before. I've mentioned it several times. I don't know how much it's landed, because again, I've been too quick, too brief in going through it. But the voice itself, my voice now, is trying to convey certain meanings, and there's a logical path through what I'm saying, and each sentence is structured grammatically, syntactically, and all that. But at the same time, there's a level of the sounds that you're hearing that transcends meaning. Yes, there's the meaning there, and hopefully you're listening for the meaning, and you're <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> it, so you can apply it in the exercises, etc., and understand <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a> and all that stuff. But there's also a <a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a> here. There's also just the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a> of the sound, the mystery, the ineffable mystery of the sounds themselves, the sounds right now of my voice. And there's an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfathomability" data-href="Unfathomability" class="internal-link">unfathomable mystery</a> in that, _if_ it's sensed with <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a>, if I can sense it with <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a>. It opens up other <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a>, but it opens up also a whole other direction of <a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a>.</span>

##### Dimensionality comes from both meaning and mystery
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^4-3" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^4-3" class="internal-link">4-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">Dimensionality</a> · <a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> (6) · <a data-href="Unfathomability" class="internal-link">Unfathomability</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So the <a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a> of any kind of verbal utterance can be through the meaning. For instance, when we convey something, and it's beautiful or poetic, or we convey an <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, or even convey our life story, or something that happened, or how we're feeling, or an <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, in the meaning of what we're conveying, we can convey mystery: the mystery of what we're conveying, the mystery of our being, the mystery of being in general, the <a data-href="unfathomability" class="internal-link">unfathomability</a> of it - for example, the <a data-href="unfathomability" class="internal-link">unfathomability</a> of the <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>. All that's conveyed when we share an <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a> and the person gets the <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, or starts resonating with the <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>.</span>

##### The mircacle of hearing and of sound

<span class="paragraph">So the person listening, also, the dimensions of what is heard, of the sounds that are heard, open up through meaning, but also _not_ through meaning, through just sounds themselves, the sensing with soul of the sounds themselves. Now, as I said, there can be there both at the same time, if we enter a certain mode of listening and mode of speaking. So right now, for instance. The meaning of this and the dimensionality, or the meaning of this and the sensing with soul of what's opened up through the meaning of what's being said in my voice, but also the dimensions that are opened up just through the sound, through the music of it, the mystery of it, the miracle of hearing and of sound. This particular sound, right now. This particular music. Different than other musics. Unique, particular.</span>

##### In 4.1.x there is still meaning, in 4.2 we are opening up dimensionality and go beyond meaning

<span class="paragraph">So both can be there at the same time, depending on both how one is speaking, but also how one is listening, whether we are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a>, of course. In this exercise, especially in the second part of this exercise, we really want to emphasize - really in both parts, because we're not using verbal sounds; yes, we're not using traditionally understood verbal sounds, or verbal sounds as traditionally understood in the first part of the <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a>, but there's still meaning there. But in this exercise, especially in the second part, we really want to emphasize that second direction of opening up <a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a>, beyond meaning, just in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a> of the sounds themselves, in the mystery of that, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mantra practice" data-href="Mantra practice" class="internal-link">incantation</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mantra practice" data-href="Mantra practice" class="internal-link">invocation</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mantra practice" data-href="Mantra practice" class="internal-link">spell-making</a>.</span>

##### Witness is just noticing (albeit by bringing the whole energy body into sensual relationship) 🟢
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^5-2" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^5-2" class="internal-link">5-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a> (6) · <a data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">Blessing</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (2) · <a data-href="Voice, Movement, and the Possibilities of Soul" class="internal-link">Voice, Movement, and the Possibilities of Soul</a> · <a data-href="Catherine McGee" class="internal-link">Catherine McGee</a> · <a data-href="Dyad" class="internal-link">Dyad</a> · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> · <a data-href="Emotions" class="internal-link">Emotions</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">In terms of instructions, for this exercise, number four, for the witness, the person who's just silently watching, sensing with all their senses, and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a>, remember, and listening and looking at the person <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a> or the person <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">moving/gesturing/vocalizing</a>, in a way, the exercise there, or the emphasis of the exercise, is really just on noticing. I think we demonstrated this at the beginning, if I remember, of that - I've forgotten what it was called now - "<a data-href="Voice, Movement, and the Possibilities of Soul" class="internal-link">Voice, Movement, and the Possibilities of Soul</a>" or something like that. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Catherine McGee" data-href="Catherine McGee" class="internal-link">Catherine</a> and I demonstrated as a <a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a>, and I asked her to move. She made very, very subtle movements, very subtle. In fact, almost none. She hardly did anything apart from blink a few times, if I remember. But if I'm open enough, and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a> in relationship, sensing with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a> (we talked about this several times), bringing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a> into sensual relationship there (without touching, in this case), then even the blinking of an eye, I'm going to notice that that has an effect in my <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a>, even in my <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">emotional body</a>, and in my <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a>. Actually, any movement, any gesture, any vocalization will affect the <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a> and, let's say, the <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a>. But we're talking now very, very subtle. If it's a very subtle movement, it might be very subtle. Of course, it might be very, very strong. It depends on all kinds of things, of course.</span>

##### Just noticing - it doesn't have to be this or that
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^5-3" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^5-3" class="internal-link">5-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">But there's no pressure for the witness for it to be this or that <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>. Really I'm just noticing: what are the effects I notice in my <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a> and in the field with these movements, gestures, vocalizations, pauses, silences, all the rest of it? Just noticing. It doesn't have to be _this_ or _that_. For the witness, so to speak, for that person in that role, it becomes really an exercise in relational sensitivity, and that's the emphasis. For the person who's moving or gesturing or vocalizing, it may be that one is really quite baffled by these instructions, or it goes along okay, and then one becomes just completely stumped, or a bit at a loss of what to do, or how to move, or what to vocalize, etc. So again, it would be very understandable, very normal, and completely okay.</span>

##### In case of feeling uncomfortable, the blesser is allowing themselves to pause, sense the space they're in (Method 1)
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^5-4" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^5-4" class="internal-link">5-4</a>**: _<a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> (2) · <a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a> (3) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">If that happens, one way of responding to that is just pause. Just stop, and just sense - sense <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>, sense the other, sense the space that you're in, sense the <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a>, sense what's going on emotionally, and just be with that sense. And out of that sensing in the pause, without pressure, then maybe - _allowing_ yourself to pause; in other words, not feeling like, "I have to keep doing something. I have to keep producing some kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movement or gesture or vocalization</a>." ==Allowing yourself to stop, pause, and sense, and taking the pressure off that way, but remaining attentive and connected and alive and attuned to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">experience of self, other, world</a>, <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a>, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">emotional body</a>. And then, perhaps, out of that, out of that sensitivity and attunement in the pause comes the instigation, the seed of the next movement or gesture or [vocalization].==</span>

##### Just keep going (Method 2)
<span class="counts"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^6-1" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^6-1" class="internal-link">6-1</a></span>
<span class="paragraph">So that would be one response. Another is kind of the opposite or complementary, which is: don't stop. Okay, so I'm baffled and stumped, and a bit at a loss what to do, but just see if you can keep moving or gesturing. And as I said before, let the material - in other words, the movement, the gesture, the voice - still be there. The material is still there. ==You're not taking your hands off the clay on the potter's wheel.== You're not taking your hands off the piano. You keep moving them on the piano. And there's making sounds as you move them, and you're responding to the sounds that you hear, and to how they make you feel, and your sense of them.</span>

---
##### Also for Method 2, sense what you're doing
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^6-2" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^6-2" class="internal-link">6-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So rather than stopping the vocalization, the gesture, or the movement, you actually just keep going. Don't stop. Don't let the bafflement or stumpedness or confusion stop you. Just keep going. But sense as you're doing so, and see if you can follow what feels in any way <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a>. Again, like on the piano, as I'm bashing away, and I'm confused: "I don't know, I'm not a piano player. What am I doing? I don't know. But when I do _this_, I press these ones down there, for example, in the low register, I press them, very soft - ooh, yeah, okay." Very soft and quiet in the low register, and it's kind of dissonant. Okay, well, that creates something, and I can kind of feel a certain mood with that, and there's a little something moving in my <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body and soul</a>.</span>

##### I'm just tuning in and sensing as it rolls along, and I follow, soulfully
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^6-3" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^6-3" class="internal-link">6-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">And then it occurs to me, just out of that very sensitivity, that something, little darts of notes high up on the high end of the piano will complement that, and so I do that. I'm not a piano player. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just responding to the feel, but I don't stop the flow of the material. In the piano analogy, I don't stop the flow of the sounds which come from the movement of my fingers hitting the keys, and in this exercise, 'the flow of the material' means I don't stop moving, gesturing, and vocalizing. But I'm just tuning in and sensing as it rolls along, as there's this flow of the material, and I follow, as best as I can, what feels in any way soulful. So like I said before, I'm letting the material shape the creation, rather than the sort of pause in the inner sense and silence, and then a sort of creation _ex nihilo_ sort of thing, or this kind of preconceived notion or idea of what it looks like, whatever I'm trying to do.</span>

##### There might be self-consciousness arising

<span class="paragraph">As I mentioned, it would be quite normal for self-consciousness to arise for the person moving, gesturing, and vocalizing. And it might be all kinds of things, variations on that: fear of looking silly, of sounding silly, of seeming silly, of being thought of as silly; a fear of being blocked, and then being judged as blocked, or just judging oneself as being blocked. It could be all kinds of things. Again, so much depends on background and history and conditioning and upbringing and all that stuff, as well as many other things - personality and soul-style. But it might be that we even _expect_ that. Just expect self-consciousness and awkwardness and a little bit of fear of judgment, etc., to come up. Maybe it's good to just expect that, and to include it. So include it as an expectation, but also include it if it comes up. And sometimes it may not need very much. We just keep going, and it's included just through mindfulness, okay? The mindfulness expands to include that: "Oh, okay. There's self-consciousness going on as well. There's a bit of anxiety, or even a lot of anxiety about looking silly or whatever it is, or sounding silly." Can there be a bit more space in the consciousness? Because anxiety will contract the space of the awareness. Sometimes just creating a bit more space can help.</span>

So that opening up the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> - for instance, to more sound, to the space of the room that you're in (especially if it's a large room), to the sky, etc. - just that opening out of more space for the <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a>, for the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, counteracts the <a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a> that's inherent, really, in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-consciousness</a>, in that kind of afflictive <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-consciousness</a>. And that also tends to be intrinsic to states of <a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a> as well. So sometimes just opening out the <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> - continuing the practice, what we're doing here, working with the dyads, but just opening out the <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a>. Still aware of the other, still aware of what one is doing, and movements, gestures, and the whole resonances of all of that, the vocalizations, aware of self, <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a>, all of that, aware of other, but all that in a larger space. Just that movement, that opening out of the <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to include more, to cover a broader space, to encompass and open to a broader space, can be really helpful as one continues with the practice.</span>

So as always with these kind of <a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a> exercises, we've talked about this before, but to stress it again: it can be so helpful as part of setting up the space, the field, setting up the <a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a>, setting up the <a data-href="temenos" class="internal-link">temenos</a>. We include, either deliberately and formally - or rather, formally, we include a specific _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice. And that can be just a few seconds, or a few minutes, or longer, whatever. We can set that up at the beginning. Or, as we said - we've been through all this before when we talked about <a data-href="temenos" class="internal-link">temenos</a> - sometimes you're with a person, and you can rest assured that there's [_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_] there; I don't have to re-stress it.

Taking care to actually put a little more emphasis and spend a little more time setting up the <a data-href="temenos" class="internal-link">temenos</a> at the beginning, or rather the aspects of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> within the <a data-href="temenos" class="internal-link">temenos</a>, can be really, really useful.</span>

Just pause: "Something's happening. It's getting in the way. I feel blocked here. There's a lot of judgment or a <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> of judgment or whatever it is." And just pause that, pause the exercise, and you can voice that. Then there is an actual articulation of something to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dyad" data-href="Dyad" class="internal-link">dyad partner</a>. Or not voice it. It could be silent, and one's just, "Okay, let's just spend a bit of time with _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>," and not necessarily telling the other what I'm doing right then, but just in that pause, however long it is, moving into a _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practice. I would suggest _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> for oneself, certainly, because that's where the affliction is, but also for the other. And maybe even, again, a sense of a larger space, the space that you're in, imbued with _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, a field of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> in which you are both sitting.

##### Sensing anything with soul also counters the contracted self-consciousness

<span class="paragraph">And then, to just briefly touch on or offer a few other possibilities, it may be, too, that there's something accessible, or a sense accessible, a perception accessible, in the dyad at that time, of oneself, of the other, of the space that you're in, of the whole environment, the world, that they can be sensed with soul. Some perception of sensing something or other with soul in all that, in all that configuration may be really helpful. So that may have perhaps started to happen, perhaps earlier in the exercise, and you can bring it back more deliberately, or lean on it a bit more. Because when there's sensing with soul, it will tend to counter that kind of reified and contracted self-consciousness, self-obsession, because that's not really a soul-movement. It may be a kind of squeezed, impoverished reflection of what's, if you like, originally a soul-movement, but in itself, it's not. So when we sense with soul, something opens that out.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And, as always, when something ignites, some constituent of the larger constellation, configuration, becomes <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, just like with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">elements of the imaginal</a>, when one of them ignites, then it's possible that the whole then ignites, and the whole thing is then perceived at a whole other level of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a>, with a whole other level of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a>, sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a> and <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a> there.

<span class="paragraph">Now, I said I wanted to introduce a variation for this, exercise number four. And in a way, it's kind of related to what I've just said, but it's a deliberate move, rather than something that might just occur spontaneously. That variation, that possibility, is that it still remains a dyadic exercise, an exercise in a dyad, but your dyad partner is actually a so-called 'intrapsychic' image. In other words, you're not doing this with another actual, physical human being. You're doing this in dyadic relationship with an image. Same thing though: you take your turn to move the body and make gestures and vocalize to the angel, to your angel who is your dyad partner, to the image there, to the imaginal figure. And then you receive, in your imagination, the movements, the gestures, the vocalizations, the blessing and just the mystery of that communication from the angel, in your imagination.</span>

##### Less chance of self-consciousness arising if we do it with an imaginal dyad partner (Reason 1)
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^10-3" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^10-3" class="internal-link">10-3</a>**: _<a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> (2) · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">Imaginal</a> · <a data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">Personhood</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Why? Well, there are a few reasons for opening up that variation, or suggesting that variation at times. One is, in relation to what we said before, that it may be that doing it on our own, especially if we're on our own in a room somewhere, that we're actually less <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-conscious</a>. If that's an issue, if that comes up, as it might for some people, actually just doing it on one's own, in the privacy of one's own <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> space, just with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a>, there's less chance of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-consciousness</a> arising because we're less under, or we _feel_ ourselves less under the scrutiny of another <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a>.</span>

---
##### Also, the practice can become more subtle (Reason 2)
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^10-4" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^10-4" class="internal-link">10-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">Imaginal</a> (3) · <a data-href="Dyad" class="internal-link">Dyad</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">But secondly, there's also a possibility - not necessary, but a possibility - that in doing it with an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a> as your <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dyad" data-href="Dyad" class="internal-link">dyad partner</a>, that the whole thing can actually become more subtle. It's almost like because, perhaps, we're in relationship with a more subtle entity (an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a>), our movements, gestures, and vocalizations can be allowed to become correspondingly subtle. We're less pulled into the gross. There's a related reason, a third reason, related to that, opening up the possibility of allowing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movements/gestures/vocalizations</a> to become more subtle, which I've said many times: in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking practice</a>, but also in other practices, oftentimes the movement into depth is a movement into more subtlety. ==So we really want to keep that range of things, the more subtle range, open, and keep exploring it - not at the exclusion of the grosser, but just a reminder that sometimes the more subtle is actually the more powerful and the more fertile and the more profound.==</span>

---
##### Can increase the range of what we're doing (Reason 3)
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^10-5" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^10-5" class="internal-link">10-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (2) · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> · <a data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">Personhood</a> · <a data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">Dimensionality</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Tied in, there might be a third reason for doing it this way sometimes, doing it intrapsychically, so to speak. It's that it may allow the movements, gestures, and vocalizations to be more unusual, stranger, in the sense that whatever we're doing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">in moving, in gesturing, in vocalizing</a>, it no longer has to look or sound so much like praising or anything recognizable at all. It may be, at least, that some of the pressure that may be constraining <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">movements/gestures/vocalizations</a>, and also <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a> of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a>, gets removed by removing the physically present other. It may be. For other times, or with other people, it'll work the other way: the actual presence of a physical <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a> with all their <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a> allows something, allows what comes through me and what I allow myself to do, it allows that to have _more_ range, both in subtlety and in the unusualness of what I'm doing.</span>

---
##### Some soul-secrets might be for the ears of the angel only (Reason 4)
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^10-6" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^10-6" class="internal-link">10-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">Personhood</a> (2) · <a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> · <a data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">Imaginal</a> · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> (5) · <a data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">Daimon</a> (6) · <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a> (2) · <a data-href="Materialism" class="internal-link">Materialism</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">Dimensionality</a> · <a data-href="Nature" class="internal-link">Nature</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">But do it both ways. Play both ways: with an actual <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a>, a physically present <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a>, and with an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">intrapsychic image</a>. It may be there are a few reasons why this helps, just doing it with an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a>, not with a physically present human. A fourth reason why, I'm just going to touch on this briefly and say: it may be that the <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a> needs some things that are, so to speak, only between me and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a>. They're secrets. They're <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-secrets</a>. They're treasures and precious confidences between me and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a>, and _only_ between me and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a>, only between you and your <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a>. And it might be, as much as the <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a> needs to realize its <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a> and its <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a> in relationship with '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Materialism" data-href="Materialism" class="internal-link">material reality</a>,' if you like, or physical beings, actual human beings, and again, the whole range and <a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a> of what that means - <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Materialism" data-href="Materialism" class="internal-link">materiality</a>, and <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a>, and human beings - as much as that's the case as a support and a foundation and the field for a lot of <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a>, it may still be that the <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a> still, at times, needs some things that are only between me and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a>, only between you and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a>.</span>

##### Remember: we are not seeking information

<span class="paragraph">So there's a variation there of this, exercise number four. And remember, if you _are_ doing it, particularly if you're doing it with [an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">intrapsychic imaginal figure</a>], this may be more likely - I'm not sure whether to call it a '<a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a>' or 'far enemy,' but certainly a deviation, a perversion a little bit from the intention of the practice - whether it's more likely to come up if we're doing it without a physical <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a> present, in a <a data-href="dyad" class="internal-link">dyad</a> with just the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a>, if it's more likely (I'm not sure) for it to come up: remember, we're not here seeking information.

Usually when the intention goes into that kind of thing, that's when I'm seeking information; usually that information is for the sake of a reified self, and what this self can get, or how it can aggrandize itself in some way. And then, what we referred to before, the Fullness of intention has slipped at that point, or it hasn't been allowed to supersede that other, narrower intention for the self: "What can _I_ get here?" The issues of power and, as I said, self-aggrandizement come in. When there's the Fullness of intention, those other intentions get pacified and they get hugely superseded.

<span class="paragraph">**(5.1)** Okay, so exercise five, again, it might be viewed as a series of exercises. I'm not really sure quite what to call it. I'm not sure it needs a name. But in a way, it's really thinking about kind of iconic moments, iconic movements and gestures, and entering into them: movements, gestures, moments that can become iconic for us, that can themselves become image, or have for a culture, at different times, themselves or for sub-cultures, become iconic. The exercise is to take one of these moments and embody it. Feel into the soul-sense of that moment, and then let your body and your voice and your gesture and movement embody it. Let the energy body and the soul-sense really get a sense. And then see what comes. In a way, this might sound, "Okay, that's a bit easier." But the level that I want to talk about it at is perhaps a little more unusual, perhaps even a little bit stranger than some of the other stuff.</span>

##### 🟡 Exercise 5.1: _Via Dolorosa_
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^12-1" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^12-1" class="internal-link">12-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Via Dolorosa" class="internal-link">Via Dolorosa</a> (2) · <a data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">Passion</a> · <a data-href="Death" class="internal-link">Death</a> · <a data-href="Christianity" class="internal-link">Christianity</a> (2) · <a data-href="Pontius Pilate" class="internal-link">Pontius Pilate</a> · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So the first one we might call - again, very tentative with names here - but something like 'the <a data-href="Via Dolorosa" class="internal-link">Via Dolorosa</a>,' if you know that name from the <a data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">Passion</a> of Christ, when Christ had been sentenced to <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a> by <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Christianity" data-href="Christianity" class="internal-link">crucifixion</a> by <a data-href="Pontius Pilate" class="internal-link">Pontius Pilate</a>. Then he was beaten, etc., and then was given this cross, this heavy cross. Those who were going to be crucified had to carry their own crosses. Weakened and injured from torture and mistreatment and imprisonment, etc., they had to still carry their crosses to the place, to Golgotha, where they were going to be crucified, going to be executed, basically. And if you know from the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Christianity" data-href="Christianity" class="internal-link">Catholic tradition</a>, there's the Stations of the Cross that they do every year, and there are certain moments on that whole path that get kind of contemplated and meditated upon, in that <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> on the Stations of the Cross. But that whole journey towards one's execution, that's the iconic movement or moment. So Christ carrying his cross. It could be on the <a data-href="Via Dolorosa" class="internal-link">Via Dolorosa</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">It doesn't have to be Christ. It could be someone anywhere about to be executed. It could be, again, borrowing from the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Christianity" data-href="Christianity" class="internal-link">Christian tradition</a>, the martyrs about to be thrown to the lions, or walking out into the amphitheatre before the lions. They know what's coming. Maybe they can even see or hear the lions, and they're just there, in that amphitheatre, in the moments before their execution, before their <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a>. What's key in this also is that they are surrounded - or Christ, or this person who is executed, or the martyrs in the amphitheatre, or someone before a firing squad - they're surrounded by those who are certainly willing one's <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a>, but even more than that, they're mocking and jeering. It may or may not be everyone in the crowd, but certainly a good portion, and maybe everyone is mocking and jeering the victim of execution.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Now, it's not that the horror and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> and the <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a> itself, themselves, or taken alone, so to speak, that form the <a data-href="telos" class="internal-link">telos</a>, that constitute the <a data-href="telos" class="internal-link">telos</a>. But rather, they are somehow part of, a piece of, a much larger <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-movement</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-duty</a>, because of how the <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a> is moving through the whole thing, how the <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a> is relating to it. It's _that_, together with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. And also because of what and whom the <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a> is standing with. Because of what and whom the <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a> is standing with and standing for. It's this standing with and standing for, and the _how_ of the ways in which the <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a> is moving through that _<a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a>_, that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, and seeing it, and sensing it with <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a>, and relating to it, that all this becomes somehow mysteriously part of a larger, wider and more profound <a data-href="telos" class="internal-link">telos</a>, movement of <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a>.</span>

##### Sense of rightness, and being stretched to the limit
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^12-5" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^12-5" class="internal-link">12-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">Daimon</a> · <a data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">Dimensionality</a> · <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> · <a data-href="Grief" class="internal-link">Grief</a> · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">And of course, it may well be, as well, that amongst all these - the sense of rightness, and the presence of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a>, and the <a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a> and all that - it may be that, it probably _would_ be that, amongst all that, there can certainly be, and probably _will_ be, some <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, some terror, some sense of torment, some doubt; a sense of loss and <a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a>, of course; a sense of the <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a> being stretched to its limits by what it's being asked to go through - almost, perhaps, to breaking point, whatever that might mean. So that kind of complex of emotional and <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a>-reactions can be there too. There's plenty here that can be very, very rich.</span>

##### The outer environment has the cruelty and jeering, the inner the faith, telos, duty

<span class="paragraph">It could be any of those. It could be Christ, if that works for you - Christ carrying the cross on the <a data-href="Via Dolorosa" class="internal-link">Via Dolorosa</a>. It could be the Christian martyrs to the lions. It could be just someone, somewhere, at some time, before a firing squad, being executed. Perhaps they're a political prisoner, and they're being executed for speaking the truth, speaking out against power. The outer environment of that whole <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a> has with it this jeering, and this incredible cruelty, but also jeering. The inner environment, so to speak, or the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-environment</a>, has with it <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a>, a sense of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a>, a sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a>, self as <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, or other, maybe the whole scene as <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>; a sense of one's <a data-href="telos" class="internal-link">telos</a>, one's <a data-href="duty" class="internal-link">duty</a>. Again, it could be really quite specific, or really not very specific.</span>

##### The practice is to sense the image in the energy body, with the soul-resonances, then receive movements, gestures, voice

<span class="paragraph">And the exercise here, this is the first part of exercise five, and they don't have to be in any order. I think there are four parts for now. We could add or change some or whatever. I'm just throwing out some examples here. But in this first one, then, one might just stand there. I'm just standing in the amphitheatre. I'm just standing before the firing squad. Or it could be the walking, walking towards the place where they put you to be executed or whatever it was, walking out to the middle of the amphitheatre. That's the <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, okay? And your job is, again, to sense into what, in that whole vague description that I've given, and those possibilities - and there can be plenty of other possibilities, that kind of thing - getting a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a> for it, sensing it in the <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a>, listening to the <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a>, listening to the emotional and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-resonances</a>, and then just seeing what movements, gestures, voice, or vocalizations want to come.</span>

==That's the practice prescription==

<span class="paragraph">**(5.2)** So I'm going to give the second one, and then I'm going to say something to qualify this whole exercise. The second one is an iconic moment from the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddhism" data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhist tradition</a>: the bhūmisparśa <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudra" data-href="Mudra" class="internal-link">mudrā</a>, which means the gesture (<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudra" data-href="Mudra" class="internal-link">mudrā</a> is a gesture), <a data-href="bhumi" class="internal-link">bhumi</a> is earth or ground, and sparśa is to touch. So it's the gesture of the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> touching the earth. Many of you will have seen this statue, with his right hand, sitting there in meditative posture, but the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s right hand touching the earth. This goes back to the mythological story: on the night of his <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a>, the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>-to-be was sitting there meditating, practising for <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a>, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mara" data-href="Mara" class="internal-link">Māra</a> comes and challenges him and attacks him in all kinds of ways. One of the challenges was, "What right do you have to sit there? What right do you have to sit in that spot, striving for <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a>, and to have taken that vow that you won't move from that spot until <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a>? What right do you have to sit there?" And the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> in response gestured, touched the earth, and asked the earth to bear witness - the earth, or the earth goddess to bear witness to his right to sit there, sit in that spot, on the earth, and work for <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a>. And the earth did exactly that, and obviated, countered <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mara" data-href="Mara" class="internal-link">Māra</a>'s challenge.</span>

##### Buddha touching the earth is calling it to bear witness
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^13-4" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^13-4" class="internal-link">13-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">Passion</a> · <a data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Awakening</a> · <a data-href="Mudra" class="internal-link">Mudra</a> · <a data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhism</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So this gesture of touching the earth, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a> on the earth to testify, to bear witness, to the right to sit there, to take a vow of immovability in one's quest for <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a>, and to sit there, and to strive, and to be awakened. So that's the _bhūmisparśa_ _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudra" data-href="Mudra" class="internal-link">mudrā</a>_. It's part of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddhism" data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhist iconography</a>, of course. It's part of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddhism" data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhist mythology</a>. It's another iconic moment. So that would be a second example for this exercise.</span>

##### It's not an acting exercise

![[Pasted image 20210724215453.png]]
<span class="paragraph">Let's qualify this a little bit, because what we're not doing here is a kind of acting exercise. This refers to some of the other exercises that I've been offering over the course of these talks: we're not doing an acting exercise. It's not like, "Oh, how convincing a portrayal can I give of this or that iconic moment?", or even, "If someone didn't know what I was acting out, if I was miming something, would they guess exactly what it was?" "Oh, that's Christ on the Via Dolorosa with his cross!" We're not interested in an exercise in acting, in developing our acting skills. We're not interested, therefore, in what it looks like to an outside observer. That, what it looks like to an outside observer, is much less important than your sense of the energy body, the emotional body, and the soul-sense of what's happening, okay?</span>

##### It's not important to recognise the situation from the outside, it's more important to resonate in the heart and the soul
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^14-2" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^14-2" class="internal-link">14-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (2) · <a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a> (5) · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> (5)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">What that means in terms of the movement is that movement, gestures, and vocalizations that you make may not be decipherable to someone else. Someone looking at you may have no sense that you're feeling into and letting come through your <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> and voice Christ on the road to Golgotha. They may have no sense that you're this kind of person, waiting to be executed. Much more important is that, so to speak, inner sense: the <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a>, the emotional sense, and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a>, and just how that wants to move the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>. The 'how' is I'm not moving it so that it can look like, so that someone could recognize and say, "Oh, it's _that_." It's just: here's the situation that I'm trying to sense into, the kind of moment I'm trying to sense into, and trying to feel that with my <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">whole energy body</a>, and all the resonances in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">the heart and the soul</a>, and then, what movement or gestures want to come, that express it, that are in response to it, that just hold it, that support the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a>? Even there, there are slightly different intentions. And again, I'm using my sense of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-resonances</a>, etc., and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body sense</a>, the emotional sense, to see: what _does_ help? What helps me cohere the movement, the gesture, the voice, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a>, the <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">emotional body</a> there?</span>

<span class="paragraph">If we go back to exercise three, I think the last part of exercise three was what I called '<a data-href="the serpent" class="internal-link">the serpent</a>.' If you remember, I was kind of careful to say, "What is that? What's <a data-href="the serpent" class="internal-link">the serpent</a>?" Again, one could hear that and think, "Okay, so now I have to move my <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> in a way that looks like a snake." Maybe I get on the ground, and I put my arms by my side, and I sort of wriggle around or writhe around or move, find a way of moving kind of like a snake, and then, "Oh, it's a snake," or it's a worm, or something someone could tell. That's not the point. That wasn't the point in that exercise either. And it may be, also, that in these kind of exercises, whether it's <a data-href="the serpent" class="internal-link">the serpent</a> or these ones that we've just talked about, it may be that there's - and of course, with the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s _bhūmisparśa_ _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudra" data-href="Mudra" class="internal-link">mudrā</a>_, one could actually just replicate that movement. And of course, that's very easy to do: just take your hand, and you touch the earth. But what we really want is the whole kind of arena and nexus and field of heightened sensitivity and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a> and resonance. And then one's open to all kinds of other movements, gestures, and vocalizations as well.</span>

##### What's happening in Exercises 5 does not have to transfer to movement or sound at all
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^14-4" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^14-4" class="internal-link">14-4</a>**: _<a data-href="The Serpent" class="internal-link">The Serpent</a> · <a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> (2) · <a data-href="Duty" class="internal-link">Duty</a> · <a data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">Daimon</a> · <a data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">Passion</a> · <a data-href="Telos" class="internal-link">Telos</a> · <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> · <a data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">Beauty</a> · <a data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">Devotion</a> · <a data-href="Nobility" class="internal-link">Nobility</a> · <a data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">Imaginal</a> · <a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">But it may be that actually in this exercise with <a data-href="the serpent" class="internal-link">the serpent</a>, or one of these from this exercise number five, that there's actually not much movement or sound at all. I'm just standing in front of the firing squad. But everything else that's endemic to that <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, in the larger sense of the <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a> - the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Duty" data-href="Duty" class="internal-link">sense of duty</a>, the sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a>, the sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a> and <a data-href="telos" class="internal-link">telos</a>, and also the mystery of that, as well as the sorrow, as well as the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>; the <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a> of that, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">sense of faith</a>, the sense of knowing one is doing the right thing, the <a data-href="nobility" class="internal-link">nobility</a> - all that is there. And it may or may not transfer to much movement or sound at all, but that's the key thing. So one goes from that, so to speak, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">inner imaginal sense</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body sense</a>.</span>

##### Holding an imaginal image and dancing at the same time is difficult
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^15-1" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^15-1" class="internal-link">15-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> (3) · <a data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">Imaginal</a> (4) · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> (3) · <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">This sensitivity is more important, and in a lot of these exercises, you know, the emphasis on the sensitivity even _more_ than a sort of clarity of an <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>. I've mentioned several times, it's actually quite hard to, let's say, dance, and at the same time, have a genuinely <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal image</a>, a fully, authentically <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal image</a>, at the same time as one is dancing. It's quite difficult. That's not to say that one might not feel a kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a> in dancing, or really enjoy it, or it's wonderful in all kinds of ways, or it's <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a> in some ways. ==But actually to hold a fully authentic <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal image</a>, and be in relation to that <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, and dance at the same time, in a way that both the dancing and the <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a> of both and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a> of both, is kind of mutually enhanced and mutually woven together and implicated, that's quite hard for most people - even most people who have a practice of dance, etc., and of the <a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a>. ==To really knead them together, stitch them together is actually quite difficult.</span>

##### Sensitivity is more important than clarity
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^15-2" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^15-2" class="internal-link">15-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So more important, I think, in a lot of these exercises, is the sensitivity. More important than, say, the clarity of an <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, or even the presence of an <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, in some cases. Sometimes it can be better, then, to start with the idea of developing the sensitivity to subtlety, and going from there. We've said that before.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(5.3)** I'm going to, like I said, throw out four possibilities for this fifth exercise of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">iconic moments</a>. And the third - again, I don't quite know what to call it; perhaps 'waiting for the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a>,' or '<a data-href="the hospitality to the angels" class="internal-link">the hospitality to the angels</a>.' Some of you may have come across, there are a couple of online seminars that I did some months ago, and they were filmed. They're somewhere or other on the web, I think. I think there's a set of eleven. But a couple of them have the title "<a data-href="Art and Dharma" class="internal-link">Art and Dharma</a>." And one of the illustrations I used for something I was trying to communicate was an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">icon</a> by Rublev. It's quite a famous <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">icon</a> in the Orthodox Church. It has two names: one is _The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Christianity" data-href="Christianity" class="internal-link">Trinity</a>_, and one is _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Abraham" data-href="Abraham" class="internal-link">The Hospitality of Abraham</a>._ It refers to an <a data-href="Old Testament" class="internal-link">Old Testament</a> story of <a data-href="Abraham" class="internal-link">Abraham</a> in his tent in the wilderness, in the desert, and he sees three travellers walking through the desert. He runs out to meet them, and makes them at home, offers his hospitality to them, and they turn out to be <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a>, three <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a>. So he feeds them, and gives them drink, and gives them a cool place to rest, etc., in the shade. That fragment of a story from the <a data-href="Old Testament" class="internal-link">Old Testament</a>, from <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Old Testament" data-href="Old Testament" class="internal-link">Genesis</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Abraham" data-href="Abraham" class="internal-link">Abraham&#x27;s hospitality to the angels</a>.</span>

##### It's about the moments prior to the scene in the Rublev's image
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^15-4" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^15-4" class="internal-link">15-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Art and Dharma" class="internal-link">Art and Dharma</a> · <a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> (2) · <a data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">Daimon</a> (3) · <a data-href="Abraham" class="internal-link">Abraham</a> (3) · <a data-href="Christianity" class="internal-link">Christianity</a> · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> (2) · <a data-href="Receptivity" class="internal-link">Receptivity</a> · <a data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">Imaginal</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">If you have come across, or if you do in the future come across, those "Art and Dharma" seminars, then what I'm talking about here, for the purposes of this exercise, is really the moments or the time prior to the scene in the icon. Because the scene in the icon is actually just the three angels. Abraham is no longer there, and the three angels, or the three, if you like, persons of the Holy Trinity, are just there at the table, having received Abraham's hospitality. This refers, in this exercise, we're focusing on the time prior to that, on Abraham and his openness of soul, his soul-antennae, his receptivity, his hospitality to the angels and the imaginal figures.</span>

##### It's the soulmaking-poise, making oneself available for the visitation of the angels
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^15-5" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^15-5" class="internal-link">15-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (2) · <a data-href="Old Testament" class="internal-link">Old Testament</a> · <a data-href="Abraham" class="internal-link">Abraham</a> (2) · <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a> · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> · <a data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">Daimon</a> · <a data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">Imaginal</a> (2) · <a data-href="Create-Discover" class="internal-link">Create-Discover</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">You think, "Well, what exactly is prescribed as a movement or a gesture or a vocalization there?" I don't know. But what would it be just to take that? As I said, at one level, some of these, and this exercise number five aren't meant quite as "I'm just acting something." But when it's not even obvious what movement goes with it, and I'm not even that interested in it looking like that scene, then it becomes an exercise at a whole other level, to do with sensitivity and attunement and openness and just seeing and connecting soul, movement, gesture, voice. It's not at all obvious what's the kind of prescribed movement/gesture/voice there. Can I feel my way in? And how do I feel my way into that? Maybe I don't even know the story. I'm not familiar with the Old Testament, or even Abraham and the rest of it. Well, Abraham's hospitality to the angels, another way of saying it, it's the soulmaking poise we referred to in some recent talks. It's the waiting in meditation for an image, making oneself available for the visitation of the angels, creating, opening, allowing and supporting a space, a psychic space that can be maybe visited by the imaginal figures, in which the imaginal figures can be created/discovered, born, can come.</span>

##### Elements which constitute the soulmaking poise
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^16-1" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^16-1" class="internal-link">16-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Old Testament" class="internal-link">Old Testament</a> · <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a> (2) · <a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> (3) · <a data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">Daimon</a> · <a data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">Imaginal</a> · <a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a> · <a data-href="Create-Discover" class="internal-link">Create-Discover</a> · <a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a> · <a data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">Devotion</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So another way, if you say, "Well, I don't know the <a data-href="Old Testament" class="internal-link">Old Testament</a>," etc., we're really talking about the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking poise</a>, or that stance. And that involves all kinds of factors. We talked about that. But humility, reverence, there before the <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a> has even come. There is, in relation to the potential of the <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, in relation to, so to speak, the place or the 'where' or the level from which the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a> come, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a> come, there is, in relation to that, a humility and a reverence. The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">elements of the imaginal</a> are already there. The sensitivity to the <a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a>, the recognition that it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Create-Discover" data-href="Create-Discover" class="internal-link">created/discovered</a>, that it's a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a> and therefore I have some work to do, as much as it is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">grace</a>. But it's definitely also a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">grace</a>. All this and more is part of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking poise</a>.</span>

##### The soulmaking poise has a range, is elastic with soft edges
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^16-2" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^16-2" class="internal-link">16-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> (4) · <a data-href="Abraham" class="internal-link">Abraham</a> · <a data-href="Christianity" class="internal-link">Christianity</a> · <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a> (4) · <a data-href="History" class="internal-link">History</a> · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> · <a data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">Imaginal</a> · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">This <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">icon</a> of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Abraham" data-href="Abraham" class="internal-link">Abraham&#x27;s hospitality to the angels</a> and, if you know some of the theology of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Christianity" data-href="Christianity" class="internal-link">Trinity</a> itself, there's a kind of openness to each other, an economy. They talk about the Trinitarian economy. It's the poise in relationship to that, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking poise</a>. And we can have, through the <a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a> of our <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking practice</a>, we can get more and more of a sense, more and more familiar with not _the_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking poise</a>, because like everything else, it's not a narrowly, rigidly defined thing; it has a range, and it will be elastic and with soft edges. But we get a sense more and more of that space. We get familiar more and more with that, the range of that space, what it can be and what it involves. And then that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking poise</a> itself can become sensed with <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a>. It, too, can become <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>. This is something I talked about, I think, even in the _Path of the <a data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">Imaginal</a>_, remember. Just the very <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> or occasion of sitting there in <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>, open to the possibility of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a> coming - that, too, can become <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>.</span>

##### Any element of the whole constellation of the imaginal can become imag (e.g. Shekhinah)
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^16-3" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^16-3" class="internal-link">16-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">Imaginal</a> (2) · <a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> · <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a> (2) · <a data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath</a> (11) · <a data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">Divinity</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">Blessing</a> · <a data-href="Abraham" class="internal-link">Abraham</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">In fact, _any_ element of the whole <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">constellation of the imaginal</a> can become <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>. It may be that the reverence itself, as a part of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking poise</a>, becomes <a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a>, or the humility, or whatever it is. Another way - and I touched on this the other day, just threw it out quite briefly - or another kind of iconic moment here that may help some people to find a way into this third part of this example is the preparation for the <a data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath</a>, on the Friday of the Jewish <a data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath</a>. The preparation for welcoming the <a data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath</a>, and the <a data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath</a> in its presence, its sort of visitation of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sabbath" data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Shekhinah</a>, the female aspect of God, sometimes also called the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sabbath" data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Bride of God</a>, the Bride of the Divine. And what the <a data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath</a> _is_ is a kind of visitation into our lives, into this plane of existence, of that level of the divine, of that aspect, of that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">face of the divine</a>. And so, what is _that_, to humbly and reverentially, and with sensitivity and care, open up the space, and create the space in one's house, in one's being, in the house of one's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, in the space that one's in, the physical space that one's in, and open that space for the immanent visitation, the <a data-href="blessing" class="internal-link">blessing</a>, arrival, of the bride, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sabbath" data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Bride of God</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sabbath" data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath Bride</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sabbath" data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Shekhinah</a>? So that would be the third one, something like that: <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Abraham" data-href="Abraham" class="internal-link">Abraham&#x27;s hospitality to the angels</a>, the preparation for welcoming the <a data-href="Sabbath" class="internal-link">Sabbath</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking poise</a> itself. Again, very hard to know what's prescribed there, or what it would look like, and it may be that not much movement or sound is involved at all. But it may be that there _is_ a lot. You have to feel your way into these things.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(5.4)** Okay, the last possibility I just want to offer for now - and you can hear in the kind of thing that I'm talking about that there are many possibilities here, but the last one for now is to take the example of <a data-href="Rosa Parks" class="internal-link">Rosa Parks</a>. Many of you know the story, obviously, and what happened. It's a significant part of - well, _human_ <a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a>, actually, but also certainly civil rights <a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a> in the US, and racial justice <a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a>. So in 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, there was, at that time, basically, in effect, racist laws - all kinds of racist laws, but also on public transport, and a kind of apartheid placed there by law. And at the discretion, in this case, of the bus driver, they could ask or demand, really, African Americans, sitting - the bus was divided into two parts: a so-called 'Negro/coloured section,' rather, and a 'white section,' and there was this basically apartheid going on. And if the whites-only section got filled, then the bus driver could extend the whites-only section, and basically make the African Americans have to get up and stand, so that the white people could sit down.</span>

##### Rosa Park not moving was an iconic moment

<span class="paragraph">So <a data-href="Rosa Parks" class="internal-link">Rosa Parks</a>, who was already an activist by that point and knew what she was about, was coming home from work one day, and this is exactly what happened: she took her seat in the so-called 'coloured section' early on in the trip, and then after a few stops, the whites-only section got filled, and then the bus driver told her to move - told her, and I think three or four others, to move, three or four other African Americans to move. They moved, and she did not move. She refused. And that's the sort of iconic moment, okay?</span>

What enabled her to do that, perhaps, was the integration of her <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">bodily sense</a> with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a>, integrated with the ethical sense - these three, almost not separate.

In terms of her voice, as I said, she was already an activist. She was already pretty outspoken, etc., and she continued to be for the rest of her life. Another interesting thing she said was that in that moment, when she didn't move, she said, "I just thought of <a data-href="Emmett Till" class="internal-link">Emmett Till</a>, and I just couldn't go back," you know, "where he was telling me to go," couldn't go back to the so-called 'coloured section.'^[_Library of Congress_, "Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words," [https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/rosa-parks-in-her-own-words/about-this-exhibition/the-bus-boycott/emmett-till-with-his-mother/](https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/rosa-parks-in-her-own-words/about-this-exhibition/the-bus-boycott/emmett-till-with-his-mother/), accessedSept. 2020: "Jesse Jackson asked her why she refused to move to the back of bus.

<span class="paragraph"><a data-href="Emmett Till" class="internal-link">Emmett Till</a>, again, many of you will know, or you should know, was a 14-year-old African American boy. Something happened, but it's very unclear what, if anything, indeed happened. But he was accused of 'offending' (I'll put that word in inverted commas), or perhaps 'flirting with,' or something like that - whether even _that_ happened or not, he was accused of 'offending' a white woman or a white girl in a grocery store or something one day. And he basically got lynched and murdered by four white men. There was a trial, but those four white men were acquitted of his murder. That was not that long before this happened with <a data-href="Rosa Parks" class="internal-link">Rosa Parks</a> in 1955. She said, "When that happened, that bus driver came back, I just thought of <a data-href="Emmett Till" class="internal-link">Emmett Till</a>, and I just couldn't move." And again, it's not for me to suppose the workings of her <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> and <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a> and heart there. But you recognize that she is also thinking of a figure, a dead figure, someone who has become very meaningful in her life because she was involved, to some extent, in the whole movement for justice there in relation to his trial. But she draws on an <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, the <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a> and the memory of <a data-href="Emmett Till" class="internal-link">Emmett Till</a>.</span>

So one of the consequences was that the African American residents of Montgomery, Alabama, boycotted the public bus service, and Rosa Parks's court case was actually being slowed down. They had to exercise tremendous tenacity walking to work, not taking the buses, car sharing where they had cars, whatever, really staying steady. It would have been much easier to take the buses. They boycotted the buses, putting indirectly financial pressure, then, on the bus company, because they weren't getting that business. Many buses just stood there empty in the garage because they weren't being filled, because the African American people who were boycotting the buses weren't filling the buses and paying for them. So eventually the city retracted, repealed the law requiring segregation on public buses. Of course, there's a larger story there with the whole civil rights movement and the US Supreme Court and all that.</span>

She was quite quiet, apparently, as a person, and serene, but dignified, without in any way being pompous or putting on airs or anything like that.

<span class="paragraph">Now, okay, so here's a certain personality, a certain kind of style of expression. Certainly it's not to imply that the only way to stand firm is in a quiet and serene way. I don't want to imply that at all. But if this is the kind of iconic moment we're drawing on or we're focusing on for this part of this exercise, then that's actually part of the image, that it is quiet and serene. So maybe you can get a sense of that, of what would it be to sense into that whole, the whole gestalt, the whole configuration of that whole moment, that whole image, that whole time, that icon, that iconic moment, and then see how that wants to be mirrored or refracted or expressed with the body movement, gesture, voice, or what wants to manifest or express in response to that or from that as a seed. As I said, you can hear three slightly different directions there, right? One is kind of embodying it. One is reflecting. One is more refracting. And one is just seeing: what happens in my soul, and from my soul or included in my soul - that's better: included in my soul - including the aspects of my soul, which are my movement, my body, my gesture, and my voice? Including those aspects of the soul, what wants to manifest? Either because it's refracting it, reflecting it, or thirdly, just in response to it or from it.</span>

And then I'm back to choosing, "Oh, Rob said the movements, it's not important. I don't want to get too rigid around the movements," and then I'm back to perhaps, for instance, just like the '<a data-href="borne aloft by angels" class="internal-link">borne aloft by angels</a>.' It's almost like the opposite kind of movement, just very fluid and watery. And I keep gravitating towards _that_ kind of movement. I've forgotten the principle. I might have understood it, the principle of why we're doing it. I might have understood it at one point, but I've forgotten it, and in not keeping the principle current, it has allowed the force of probably long-standing <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a> - and as I said, usually the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a> here go on, have been reiterated and strengthened over decades, and some other possibilities have atrophied, some other avenues have been blocked for decades.</span>

Oh, yeah, right," in the absence of reminding myself why, then the habit takes over, and the habit for the weaker movement, the kind of more flowy movement or whatever it is, the softer movement, the pink, fluffy angels, etc., perhaps. If I remind myself of the principles - this is what I said about structural listening and understanding things structurally - the principle tells me. If I understand the principle, then I understand, "Oh, yeah. It's about range. The principle is telling me it's about range of movement/gesture/voice, of having those avenues and pathways be fully open, fully available for the influx of soul and the efflux of soul, and the manifestation of soul in life." And I remember that's the principle, and so I want range there. I want them all to be open. If I just remember the principle, the range of what I'm doing will not shrink to just the ones that I'm used to doing, out of habit or indoctrination, or the cultures I've moved in, or whatever it is, or personal history, or trauma, whatever it is.</span>

<span class="paragraph">I can't remember; I think it was in the _<a data-href="Eros Unfettered" class="internal-link">Eros Unfettered</a>_ series. I quoted a Sanskrit line from the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Guhyasamaja Tantra" data-href="Guhyasamaja Tantra" class="internal-link">Guhyasamāja Tantra</a>.^["[[The World and More]]"] It's actually a line that's quite common. It's almost a stock phrase or stock sentence introducing some tantras. In English, it says, "Thus have I heard, on one occasion, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddha" data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Bhagavān</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddha" data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">the Blessed One</a>, was dwelling (vijahāra)," it says, in sarvatathāgatakāyavākcittaguhyahṛdayavajra. Actually, it's a longer compound. What you get there - okay, where is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddha" data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">the Blessed One</a> dwelling on one occasion? And then you get this compound, which is kind of like a jewel, multifaceted jewel that, because of the structure of the Sanskrit language, can yield so many different permutations of meaning.

Well, it means multiple things. It means many things at different levels. And even each one of the way we might kind of carve up that compound grammatically and syntactically, even that can mean many things at different levels.</span>

I mean, once in a while, but mostly he called himself the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddha" data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Tathāgata</a>.

In a way, I said part of it before, which is that we can have a preliminary exercise, or a sort of foundation exercise, and as we develop that, and as the <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a> develops, the range, both in terms of a sort of lateral scope, breadth, and depth and <a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a>, and the sensitivity and the subtlety and all the rest of it, of that practice really starts to expand as we practise the exercises, as the <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a> kicks in, in relation to those preliminary exercises, and that field, that arena or domain. What starts as a preliminary becomes in itself <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a> and gets stretched in all kinds of ways. I want to repeat that as well, here, now.</span>

##### Rinpoches spend most of their time doing Ngöndro, what are basically preliminary exercises
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^23-1" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^23-1" class="internal-link">23-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Tibetan Buddhism" class="internal-link">Tibetan Buddhism</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dzogchen" class="internal-link">Dzogchen</a> (2) · <a data-href="Ultimate truth" class="internal-link">Ultimate truth</a> · <a data-href="Mahamudra" class="internal-link">Mahamudra</a> · <a data-href="Ngöndro" class="internal-link">Ngöndro</a> · <a data-href="Preliminaries" class="internal-link">Preliminaries</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">A second thing, and very related, is if you ask, say, a Tibetan rinpoche, or someone with a lot of practice in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tibetan Buddhism" data-href="Tibetan Buddhism" class="internal-link">Tibetan tradition</a>, or who is even regarded as a master, and you ask them, say a <a data-href="Dzogchen" class="internal-link">Dzogchen</a> master or something like that, where there's so much emphasis in <a data-href="Dzogchen" class="internal-link">Dzogchen</a> on _not_ doing, sort of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ultimate truth" data-href="Ultimate truth" class="internal-link">the ultimate</a> practice in that kind of language, or some <a data-href="Mahamudra" class="internal-link">Mahamudra</a> traditions, etc., and you actually ask them, or they report what they spend most of their formal practice time doing, they still, even after many years, spend perhaps most of their time doing what are basically preliminary exercises. <a data-href="Ngöndro" class="internal-link">Ngöndro</a> is the Tibetan, some of you will know. So yes, 'preliminary' as in, "This needs to come first. This is what precedes." But it doesn't necessarily mean that then, "Okay, now I've done that, and then I stop. First we do this, then I stop doing that because I've done it, and I've accomplished what I want to accomplish, and I can just do my sort of more advanced practice." There's that whole relationship with this notion of <a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a> that's very much the kind of dominant one, actually, in people who take their practices in <a data-href="Tibetan Buddhism" class="internal-link">Tibetan Buddhism</a> very, very seriously, and rinpoches and masters, etc.</span>

##### I'm not really sure about the word 'preliminary'
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > ^23-2" data-href="0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^23-2" class="internal-link">23-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Preliminaries" class="internal-link">Preliminaries</a> (2) · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> · <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">I'm not really sure about this word, 'preliminary.' I'm partly picking it and using it because there _are_ <a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a>, as I've tried to explain, to certain areas, directions, domains of our being and our life's opening up with <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a>. So in some ways they _are_ <a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a>. But also, as we've explained, they can be expanded, stretched, developed. They can become <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a> in themselves. They can become extraordinary and not basic at all. So there's a whole range, and I think you will get that sense with all this.</span>

##### There are preliminaries, and there's soulmaking

<span class="paragraph">How does one relate to this, all these practices, over time, as one's developing one's <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a> practices? There are <a data-href="preliminaries" class="internal-link">preliminaries</a>, and there's <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a>. Maybe it's in parallel, these two, and going back and forth, and periods of one or the other, all that. So I don't know that that's necessarily universally formulaic. One might have to see. But for right now, we can use the word 'preliminary' with that, with that caveat.</span>
