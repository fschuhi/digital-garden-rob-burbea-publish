##### Summary of part 1 and 2
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > ^1-1" data-href="0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#^1-1" class="internal-link">1-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> (11) · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">Fabrication</a> (3) · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> (3) · <a data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">Dependent Origination</a> · <a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a> · <a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40192/20170117-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_3-40192.mp3#t=00:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Okay, so in the last part, in part two of this talk, we unpacked a little bit, outlined, laid out a different way of thinking about [[clinging]] and this teaching of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">non-clinging</a>, so that one is actually investigating the [[experience]] of [[clinging]], that movement of [[clinging]], and times of more [[clinging]], less [[clinging]], even less [[clinging]], becoming skilful at moving up and down on that spectrum. And opening up, through doing that, first of all, what that word '[[clinging]]' means, and seeing that it, too, is a spectrum of very, very gross to very, very subtle, and using it as an entry point and a tool, a key for investigation into the [[fabrication]] of [[perception]], the [[fabrication]] of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a> of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a>, and the investigation of seeming reality, the questioning of that reality through the mechanism of playing with [[ways of looking]] and [[fabrication]], centred on the concept of [[clinging]]. And opening up in that way, very deeply, momentously, the actual sense of existence (as opposed to trying to live without [[clinging]], somehow live a life that's free of [[clinging]], [[craving]], etc.).</span>

---
##### Life without clinging is impossible, but there is also a second problem with the ideal of living without it
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > ^1-2" data-href="0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> (4) · <a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a> (2) · <a data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">Fabrication</a> · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> (2) · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40192/20170117-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_3-40192.mp3#t=01:55" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And through that, we also saw that it actually, in a way, doesn't make sense to live without [[clinging]], to try and live without [[clinging]] and [[craving]], because [[clinging]]/[[craving]] are actually elements, if you like, necessary for the [[fabrication]] of [[perception]], for any <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a> to appear, for us to live in the world, [[experience]] a world. So in that sense, too, it doesn't quite make sense. But as I said, there's a second problem with this ideal of living without [[clinging]]. And in some ways, for some people, it will be very obvious. Maybe it's hard for them to articulate it, and certainly hard for them to square it and reconcile it with a more usual <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>, but the problem is obvious. For other people, interestingly, the problem and the difficulty here is not obvious at all, and that's interesting. I'll come back to that, actually, throughout this [[retreat]].</span>

##### Who would even want to live without clinging?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > ^1-3" data-href="0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> (5) · <a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a> (3) · <a data-href="Activism" class="internal-link">Activism</a> (2) · <a data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">Personhood</a> · <a data-href="Constriction" class="internal-link">Constriction</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40192/20170117-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_3-40192.mp3#t=03:08" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">But the second problem is, as I said, would we even _want_ to live a life without [[clinging]], without [[craving]]? And what would that look like? Have we actually thought out or explored what that would mean, what it would look like? What would such a goal, living without [[clinging]]/[[craving]] - I'm just going to use the word '[[clinging]]' for shorthand - what would such a goal imply and entail for the different domains or areas of our existence, areas and directions of our existence that we really care deeply about? So what would it entail, that kind of goal, and imply, for instance, for our <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Activism" data-href="Activism" class="internal-link">engagement</a>? Politically, environmentally, the world crying out for this. If I have this ideal, non-attachment, no [[craving]], no [[clinging]], very even keel, what might it imply for areas such as <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Activism" data-href="Activism" class="internal-link">engagement</a>? Or even our own [[personhood]], and the range of styles of, if you like, personality or persona or expression in the world? What does this rather simplistic and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Constriction" data-href="Constriction" class="internal-link">constrained</a> ideal of 'living without [[clinging]]' imply for these areas? What would it imply and entail for art, and our relationship with art, making art? I've talked about all of these in other talks, so I'm not going to dwell very long on this.</span>

##### Art, sexuality without desire?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > ^1-4" data-href="0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Music" class="internal-link">Music</a> · <a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a> (2) · <a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> (2) · <a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a> · <a data-href="Zen" class="internal-link">Zen</a> (2) · <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music > Jazz" data-href="Music#Jazz" class="internal-link">Music &gt; Jazz</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Romantic love" class="internal-link">Romantic love</a> (2) · <a data-href="Sexuality" class="internal-link">Sexuality</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40192/20170117-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_3-40192.mp3#t=04:55" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">But for instance, ==is it even possible to create a large form (say a long piece of [[music]], or a novel, or a film or something, or a painting that takes a long time) without [[craving]], [[clinging]], attachment, [[desire]]? Or training - the long, dedicated training it takes to develop that kind of mastery in spontaneity==, if you like, of the <a data-href="Zen" class="internal-link">Zen</a> calligraphist, or the <a data-href="Zen" class="internal-link">Zen</a> sword fighter, or the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music > Jazz" data-href="Music#Jazz" class="internal-link">jazz</a> artist? What would this goal of living without attachment, without [[clinging]], without [[craving]], mean for the way we [[love]] our families, family members, friends, deep friendships, [[romantic love]]? What on earth would it mean for the realm of [[romantic love]], for our [[sexuality]]? Even for food, and for the kind of care and [[attention]] to detail and loveliness that some people bring when they prepare food, cook food, and share it with others, offer it to others.</span>

##### Neither simplicity nor more Buddhist concepts is the answer
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > ^2-1" data-href="0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> (7) · <a data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">Letting go</a> · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> (2) · <a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">Brahmaviharas</a> · <a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> (2) · <a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">Habit</a> · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> · <a data-href="Activism" class="internal-link">Activism</a> (2) · <a data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">Personhood</a> (2) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (3) · <a data-href="Romantic love" class="internal-link">Romantic love</a> · <a data-href="Sexuality" class="internal-link">Sexuality</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So if we have this idea, 'living without [[clinging]],' how then are these areas, these domains and directions of our being and our existence, our life today, how are they then related to and viewed? What is implied about them? Certainly if I have too simplistic an idea of "just drop [[clinging]], just <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a>," that kind of thing, what then is implied about all that? But also if I kind of piece together and fit together a collection of other <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> concepts, and differentiate between them - attachment, [[clinging]], [[craving]], _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ and the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a>_, this word that I used, _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">hitacchanda</a>_, the sort of well-wishing, but also [[desire]], for decreasing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, we could say, in ourselves and hopefully in the world. If we differentiate also, the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> outlined [[clinging]] to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasures</a>, [[clinging]] to views, [[clinging]] to customs and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a>, [[clinging]] to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a>. If we bring that collection of concepts to bear on all these themes and areas and directions of our life - <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Activism" data-href="Activism" class="internal-link">engagement</a>, potential <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Activism" data-href="Activism" class="internal-link">engagement</a> of our [[personhood]] and the range of styles of [[personhood]], art, family [[love]], friend [[love]], [[romantic love]], sexual [[love]], [[sexuality]], sexual expression, food, all that - how is it viewed, if it's either viewed very simplistically, or through this collection of sort of more traditional <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> concepts? How would those areas be viewed?</span>

<span class="paragraph">We'll talk more about this. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">Fantasies</a> are actually also involved in the [[fantasy]] or the idea of "<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a>," that seemingly simple, pithy teaching. Actually, usually there's not just a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual structure</a> behind that, underpinning it, but there's also a whole [[image]] and [[fantasy]].

Maybe it's the [[image]] "<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a>," and we hold that as an ideal, but it's also a kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">iconic image</a> for us somewhere. Maybe <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hermit" data-href="Hermit" class="internal-link">the hermit</a>, simple man, simple woman, living close to [[nature]], wandering in the mountains, in the breeze of the air, and they're being light and fluid, because they're [[letting go]], light and fluid as the breeze, as the mountain stream that they sit beside. There's a beautiful [[fantasy]] wrapped up in that whole [[image]], maybe other <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasies</a>. And as I've said plenty of times in other talks, the way _I'm_ using that word, '[[fantasy]],' <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasies</a> are not a problem.

<span class="paragraph">So conscious [[fantasy]] is very much a part of our lives - well, unconscious and conscious. But we can make them conscious, and we can recognize, as I said, the necessity of that and the place of that for the [[psyche]]. I'm going to talk much more about this. But sometimes the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasies</a> that we have that come out of our <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> background and <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> set of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasies</a> or ideas are actually inadequate. So the idea and the [[fantasy]] of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, for example, being what is adequate for [[romantic love]] ... I'm saying that the wrong way. When we care about and are involved in or seek [[romantic love]], as so many practitioners do, of course, who are not monastics (and actually even some people who _are_ monastics), when that is present, and if we try and think of it, "What's happening here? Why is this [[desire]] justifiable?" "Well, it's _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>,_" or, "Well, it's _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kalyanamittata" data-href="Kalyanamittata" class="internal-link">kalyāṇamittatā</a>_. It's [[spiritual friendship]]. This partnership is basically based in _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>,_ and it's [[spiritual friendship]], and that's what my [[romantic love]] relationship, my marriage, is." I mean, certainly I would hope, we would hope, I think we would all hope that _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ is a basis, or at least a component of [[romantic love]] and [[spiritual friendship]]. It's beautiful. But is that _all_ of it? Does that actually suffice? Does that truly, adequately psychologically represent what's happening? And am I then going to say, "Oh, it's _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ and _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kalyanamittata" data-href="Kalyanamittata" class="internal-link">kalyāṇamittatā</a>_, [[spiritual friendship]], and just [[clinging]], basically"? Does that suffice as an explanation?</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(1)** So the first we could call, it's like, that [[desire]] for that piece of chocolate cake. I don't need it nutritionally. But I want it.

But then, actually, what we're talking about is not only <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a> here and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">cravings</a>, levels of [[craving]], but also levels of investigation of [[craving]]. It's important to investigate and have some facility with [[letting go]] of that [[desire]] for that cookie, or that chocolate cake, whatever it is, that cup of tea when I don't really need it, whatever. This is important, you know? That's one level and direction of [[desire]], and it's one level and direction of investigation then.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(2)** But then there's what we outlined in part two of this long prefatory/preface talk, the whole use of, the idea of and the movement of, whether we call it **[[clinging]] or [[craving]] or whatever it is, [[desire]], that whole movement, and exploring the subtlety of that, and how that unravels for us the [[nature]] of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a>**, the [[fabrication]] of [[perception]], and what that tells us about reality, etc. So we're talking about really, really subtle levels of [[clinging]], and a much more broad range of what '[[clinging]]' means. As I said, ==_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a>_ is [[clinging]], this belief in the reality of something existing independently from the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a>. It's a [[clinging]]. I need to refine my practice until I can actually play with the spectrum, actually move that [[clinging]] of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a> up and down on a spectrum, and see what happens.== That would be a second level, direction of what we might call '[[clinging]]' for shorthand, and the investigation.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(3)** And then there's a third, if you like, level or direction, what we might call - well, I'm going to call it **the movement of [[eros]]**. For instance, our [[soul]]-<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">passions</a>. Obvious when it's the bigger ones: falling in [[love]], or my [[passion]] for my art, or whatever it is, my [[passion]] for expression, my [[passion]] for <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Activism" data-href="Activism" class="internal-link">engagement</a>. They can be huge. But this movement, what I'm going to call the movement of [[eros]], without, unfortunately, in this talk, explaining too much what I mean (that makes it a little bit difficult, but), there are _other_ movements that are not just about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasure</a> and relief. Not just about, either, unpacking this notion of [[clinging]] so that it tells me something about the whole [[nature]] of seeming reality. The movement of [[eros]] and of [[soul]]-[[passion]] can be huge, marked, deep, or really quite subtle.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So then the question becomes: what is required of each of these directions or levels of investigation? What is the purpose in relation to all three? The purpose of my investigation relative to that extra slice of chocolate cake or whatever it is, it has one. It has a range of purpose. It's quite limited where it can take me, also, as we've been saying. The purpose of my investigation of that whole concept, from the most gross to the most subtle, of [[clinging]] and its relationship with [[fabrication]] of [[perception]] and apparent reality and world, that has a different purpose. And what is the purpose of my investigation of what we might call the movements of [[eros]] - those things that I'm passionate about, whether it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Activism" data-href="Activism" class="internal-link">engagement</a> or art or expression in life or [[love]], different kinds, whatever it is? ==What is the purpose?

It's just the wrong kind and level of [[desire]]. Investigation specific to that is important, to have some [[freedom]].

<span class="paragraph">==And, conversely, the investigation of my [[soul]]-<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">passions</a>, and my [[desire]] in relation to that, and that kind of [[eros]], whether it's really strong or much more subtle, won't be - it will actually tell me _something_ about [[dependent origination]] and [[emptiness]], _something_, but not enough for the full monty there, the full depth of that.== So each has its own - I don't know - door, direction, avenue.

Noticing ease when I let go of something that the [[mind]] is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a> onto or wanting, when I relax [[craving]], is only the start.

Does this suffice to sort of categorize our <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a> and what we're actually seeking from all our <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a>? Certainly sometimes we're seeking <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasure</a>. I'll talk about this. Certainly sometimes I'm trying to get [[happiness]]. Certainly sometimes I want _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_. Sometimes I want ease. What else? It's relatively easy to see that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasures</a> are not going to fulfil me.

I'm not talking here about, you know, the kinds of things we do which we can kind of acknowledge and accept as, "Well, I basically did that because of [[craving]]. I had that extra slice of chocolate cake. I overate just a little bit because someone put this really tasty thing in front of me." Or, "Yeah, you know, every winter I fly to France or Switzerland or" - I don't know where they go in the States - "Colorado or wherever to go skiing. And yeah, if I'm honest, I don't really _need_ that, and I can kind of see, if I really look, that I sort of justify it to myself, because I say, 'I work hard, so I deserve a rest,'" and that sort of thing. But basically, if I'm honest, I can see [[craving]], in that case, has trumped [[ethics]] in terms of the carbon output and contribution to [[global warming]] and other people's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the world. If I'm really honest, I can see that's just a movement of [[craving]]. I'm not really talking about all that.

But to varying degrees - and again, this is something we'll come back to - to varying degrees we want, human beings want _more_ than ease and peace. ==We want _more_ than ease and peace - certainly, probably certainly, than either the kind of ease and peace that is just a matter of stress reduction, or coping with [[pain]], painful sensations.

Even within the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, isn't it more than ease you want? Isn't it more than _that_ that you're looking for? Yes, there's ease.

##### Discrepancy-based processing (mindfulness-based cognitive therapy)
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > ^7-2" data-href="0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#^7-2" class="internal-link">7-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> · <a data-href="Discrepancy-based processing" class="internal-link">Discrepancy-based processing</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mode of mind" class="internal-link">Mode of mind</a> · <a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a> · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40192/20170117-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_3-40192.mp3#t=37:08" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">In the world of [[mindfulness]]-based cognitive therapy, and actually spilling over from there into the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, some people talk about this concept, term, called '[[discrepancy-based processing]].' Basically, it means when the [[mind]] is in what they call a [[mode of mind]], and the [[mind]] is in a mode where it notices the difference between where it _wants_ to be and where it actually _is_, something it <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a> versus how reality actually is. So, for example, very simple, there's a sensation of thirst, so there's a discrepancy - I don't want that sensation of thirst; it would be good to drink. There's a discrepancy between that idea of quenching the thirst, and the reality is, at the moment, there is no water. Therefore, I go to the tap or go to the well or whatever it is. The [[discrepancy-based processing]], that [[perception]] of differences, directs the organism to meet its needs, if you like, based on noticing differences and trying to minimize that discrepancy.</span>

##### There is the idea that discrepancy-based processing is the opposite of mindfulness
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > ^7-3" data-href="0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#^7-3" class="internal-link">7-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Discrepancy-based processing" class="internal-link">Discrepancy-based processing</a> (3) · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> (5) · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> · <a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">And that [[discrepancy-based processing]] is set in contrast to, quote, '[[mindfulness]],' which is, in a certain way of teaching about it, [[mindfulness]] is just being with things as they are, accepting, paying [[attention]] to, opening to, without wanting to change, without being interested so much in that discrepancy between how I would like things to be and what is. So these two things are kind of different gears, if you like - the gear of [[discrepancy-based processing]] and the gear of [[mindfulness]] - missing out, it seems, the fact that you can be <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a> of a discrepancy and of the [[desire]], etc., and of the movement, etc. But let's leave that aside. There's an idea of [[mindfulness]] as something that's, if you like, the opposite or complementary to [[discrepancy-based processing]].</span>

##### Discrepancy-based processing is useful, of course
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > ^7-4" data-href="0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#^7-4" class="internal-link">7-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Discrepancy-based processing" class="internal-link">Discrepancy-based processing</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">And it's acknowledged, in the way that they're regarding this [[discrepancy-based processing]], of course it's okay at times. Why? Because it's useful. It's functional. It's instrumental in that, look, if I need a toilet built, I need to first recognize there's a discrepancy between what _is_ and what _should_ be for hygiene purposes or whatever. Or there's hunger, and we notice the discrepancy between that and feeling satiated and nourished, so that leads us to cook. Or again, framing it more biologically in terms of evolution, as would be a lot of people's want, to do that, recognize the discrepancy there's no food, therefore we need to forage or hunt for food. So it's useful, this [[discrepancy-based processing]]. It's regarded as useful, okay at times, as long as we don't get too tight, too excited, too agitated.</span>

<span class="paragraph">But otherwise, the so-called [[mode of mind]] - this idea of '[[mode of mind]]' is something a little bit related to what I'm calling '[[ways of looking]],' but probably, I think, it's fair to say nowhere near as broad in the ranges and the diversity or the depth or subtlety of what can be involved in that. But otherwise, ==the [[mode of mind]], the gear, the circuitry, if you like, should revert to a kind of more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a> stance, a kind of neutral gear, which will be more easeful of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> that's inherent in discrepancy-based processing.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">What does it say about the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Eros" data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">gaze of eros</a>?

Sometimes we can be oversimplistic as human beings, and especially in regard to [[spirituality]]. Sometimes, you know, what can happen is a person can, for decades, kind of abide in and with an overly simplistic view in relation to [[craving]] and [[desire]], these ideas.

##### How can we conceive of a clinging which opens towards what is deeply important to us?

<span class="paragraph">So we're talking here about [[relationships]] with [[desire]], [[craving]], [[clinging]], [[eros]], whatever words you want to use, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> and relating to this whole aspect, area, these forces in our lives. I'm certainly not saying that every erotic [[desire]], a [[desire]] of [[eros]], the movement of [[eros]], needs to be physically acted upon, needs to be made materially manifest. You know that, if you've listened to some other talks. But the question is, what does this movement of [[psyche]] need? What does it need? Where does it lead? Or rather, ==are there ways of conceiving, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a>, [[relationships]] and investigations, that open otherwise closed doors for us? And doors that are deeply important to us, that it's deeply important to us to move through, because of what they open to, because of where they take us?== So this is really what I want to go into. How can we think about the whole domain and the different kinds of [[desire]], [[craving]], [[clinging]]? How can we conceive of all that? What [[relationships]] and what kinds of investigations can we bring to bear that open this up for us, and don't actually keep certain doors shut that are deeply important to us?</span>

<span class="paragraph">Some people will need more practice, do need more practice, with just the simple idea of [[letting go]] of [[craving]] that I talked about in part one - gross [[craving]], slightly more subtle [[craving]] in their life - so that one is less chained to pleasant and unpleasant _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a>_, being led or dragged around by the [[craving]] that comes towards or away from pleasant or unpleasant _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a>_, sensation.

It's possible, as I said, to take up this notion of [[clinging]], and actually explore the whole range of subtlety of what that means, and play with it, and learn to modulate it, and see what happens to the dependent [[fabrication]] of [[perception]] of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self, other, world, time</a>, etc., and unpack through that, or have revealed through that, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a>, the [[insight]] into the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a> of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self, other, world</a>, etc. Deep level of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a>.

And I'm not just meaning by that this _[[chanda]]_, this intentionality or [[desire]] for reducing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, for what is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a>. That might be one manifestation of [[eros]]. I'm not just talking about that though.</span>

<span class="paragraph">We need, the [[psyche]] needs, to bring [[attention]] to bear so that it recognizes this movement, recognizes [[eros]], delineates it, perhaps, has a way of conceiving and thinking that's actually supportive to the [[eros]], supportive then to the totality, the integrated totality of what we conceive of as practice. Because that investigation and that movement of [[eros]] also, just like the deep exploration of [[fabrication]] through the playing with the spectrum of [[clinging]], this deep and wide exploration, subtle exploration of [[eros]] also, but in a different way, opens up our sense of the world radically, widely, beautifully. Opens up the whole sense of existence.</span>

<span class="paragraph">But, you know, _you_ decide what you want. You decide. Some people (and for very different reasons) don't want much depth or much [[soulmaking]], much <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a>. And for different reasons. We'll actually go into these different reasons as part of the [[retreat]], because it's also quite interesting, what's happening there. But some people - and this needs to be respected - that's not what they want. They want some techniques of what we could call kind of self-help, really, and they want some ease, and they want a reduction in _[[dukkha]]_, and that's great. That's important. Others, though, this opening of the sense of existence, these radical and remarkable openings that are possible in the whole sense of existence, not just of self but of the whole of one's sense of existence, the deep <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> of [[emptiness]], and the deep and wide and eventually all-pervasive movement of [[eros]] and [[soulmaking]] - these, for others, are the most important things, the things they care most deeply and most passionately about.</span>

<span class="paragraph">But it's not for me, I don't think - I don't think it's for me, I don't think it's for anyone - to tell another person what to want. So, as I said, you decide what you want. But still, we can investigate this whole question of [[desire]] and [[eros]], and making [[delineations]] and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a>, and see where that leads, and then decide whether we want to go where it leads or not. We can still investigate. It's always up to us where we want to go. This is a little bit what I want to go into on this [[retreat]], a little bit of an introduction, and what we want to really fill out and expand and explore in the course.</span>
