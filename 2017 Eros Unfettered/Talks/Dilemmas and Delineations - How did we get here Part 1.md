[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 -|bare list]]

##### We will gradually unfold the semantic web of "eros"
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > ^1-1" data-href="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^1-1" class="internal-link">1-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> (2) · <a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a> · <a data-href="Alchemy" class="internal-link">Alchemy</a> · <a data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">Delineations</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40163/20170118-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_1-40163.mp3#t=00:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">This is really a [[retreat]], a course, on the theme, on the subject, exploring the themes of [[eros]] and [[desire]] and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Alchemy" data-href="Alchemy" class="internal-link">alchemy of desire</a>. I want to take a little time now, over the next few talks, to begin to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">delineate</a> what _we_ mean when we use this word, '[[eros]].' So to begin to do that. As you'll quickly see, the way we're using that word is actually woven in with a whole web, if you like, a whole dynamic web of other words that we're using quite specifically - related ideas, related notions, related experiences. So we'll have to kind of gradually unfold all this, unpack it, if you like, or gradually (reverse analogy) build a framework, an architecture that will help us here, build our ship or our vehicle.</span>

##### Why delineate?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > ^1-2" data-href="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> (2) · <a data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">Delineations</a> (2) · <a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a> · <a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a> · <a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40163/20170118-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_1-40163.mp3#t=01:25" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">In the course of doing that, and explaining or unpacking a little bit - 'elaborating' is a better word - elaborating a bit on, gradually, what we mean by '[[eros]],' and what it involves, what it implies, etc., where it goes, in the course of delineating, the question comes up: why? Why <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">delineate</a>? We touched on that briefly already, but there's actually more to say. Why make this extra delineation of something called [[eros]]? Because we have a lot of words, like we said. We have [[desire]], [[craving]], [[clinging]], attachment, [[love]], you know. So why make this extra delineation? I want to say a bit more about that. And I also want to weave into all this just some reflections on making [[delineations]] and definitions in general. So some general reflections on that, because actually it is very relevant to the whole project that we're doing and where it can go.</span>

##### Teaching is always contextual
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > ^1-3" data-href="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> · <a data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">Delineations</a> (2) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (2) · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40163/20170118-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_1-40163.mp3#t=02:29" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So, you know, unless you teach in some way or other, in some subject or art or whatever it is, it may not be obvious to you, but it's obvious to me that teaching is always, _always_ contextual. In talking about [[eros]] now, there is the context. There's a double context, at least. One is the context of: how did we get here? What is it that led up to these kind of [[delineations]], and making the [[delineations]] and the justifications and the explanations that we're about to go into slowly, gradually? That comes out of a whole trajectory, a whole progression of exploration and [[insight]] that, in a way, one thing led to the other, one thing unfolded another. So there's the context of where we're coming from. And, in a way - I'll go into this later - I'm coming from a background in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a>, but a certain way of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> and approaching what <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a> is, and what the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> is, and how to think of that.</span>

---
##### Our context is Buddhist / insight meditation
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > ^1-4" data-href="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> · <a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a> · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">Delineations</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40163/20170118-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_1-40163.mp3#t=03:53" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">But there's also the context of who one is talking to, who one is teaching, and the context in which one teaches. So that teaching about [[eros]] and [[desire]], and shining a different light on them in a Buddhist context and in an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a> context, _is_ a certain context. It's not necessarily the easiest or most straightforward context to raise these issues and hope to bring some fresh illumination or fresh turning of the earth, if you like. There are other contexts, for instance in - I don't know - psychotherapeutic contexts or philosophical contexts where, in a way, it would be much more straightforward. There would still be <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a> and things to make. But in some ways, the context that we're in makes it more challenging, but also we're lent certain advantages, I think, by our practice and by our <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>, that other disciplines and directions don't have.</span>

##### International meeting of Insight Meditation teachers, Gaia House, 2005
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > ^2-1" data-href="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> (2) · <a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40163/20170118-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_1-40163.mp3#t=05:09" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">About the context: I remember an international meeting of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a> teachers in 2009, I think it was. It actually took place at <a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a>. It happens every, I don't know, three years? Something like that. Three or four years. It kind of rotates between three, maybe four centres - IMS, and Spirit Rock, and maybe Beatenberg; I can't remember - around the world. That year, it was at <a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a>, and maybe eighty <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a> teachers. I can't remember. Very senior ones, all the way down to very, very new teachers. And they're from all over the world - well, actually, mostly Europe and America, USA. So part of that group, we had three or four days together, I think, and there were different discussion groups that were sort of offered. Periodically we would break, and certain themes would be offered, and then the people interested in _this_ theme would go and make a little group and discuss it for a while, and people interested in another theme would go and make their little group and discuss it.</span>

---
##### Eros was the biggest breakout group
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > ^2-2" data-href="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40163/20170118-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_1-40163.mp3#t=06:32" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">One day, one of the themes that was offered was [[eros]]. There are a couple of things to me that are interesting about what happened. One is that it was _by far_ [laughs] the biggest discussion group. So there was enormous interest in that topic, so much so that actually I think the group of people, the sub-group of the larger group that were interested in [[eros]] and elected to go into _that_ group, had to be divided into three to make them manageable discussions and interesting and worthwhile.</span>

---
##### There was no common definition of Eros
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > ^2-3" data-href="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40163/20170118-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_1-40163.mp3#t=07:09" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So I was in a group that I think had at least ten people in it, and there were maybe two others like that. That was the first thing: look how much interest there was in this topic in Buddhist practitioners, Buddhist teachers, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a> teachers, already in 2009. Partly it's because so little is said about it in our tradition. So that was the first thing that was interesting. The second thing to me that was interesting was, we gathered in our group of, let's say, ten people (I can't remember), ten teachers, and a few of us, several of us, said, "Hold on. Before we get into this, can we actually just kind of say or agree what we mean by '[[eros]]'?" And immediately it became very apparent that there was no common [meaning]. We had come to this group with quite a large range of what people thought '[[eros]]' meant, or what it meant to them. No one was particularly attached to "it means this" or anything like that, but there was really not a clarity or a common, shared meaning, even.</span>

---
##### Some equated eros with desire
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > ^2-4" data-href="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^2-4" class="internal-link">2-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a> (8) · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40163/20170118-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_1-40163.mp3#t=08:35" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">I remember one teacher just seemed to equate it with [[desire]] in general. If I understood her correctly, she was saying that her approach to this was - again, not very conventional <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, but it's more like, let the students have their <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a>. So if you want that chocolate cake, have the chocolate cake. If you want this or that, have it. And in having it, and feeling it, and exploring it, and going into that [[experience]], over time (this was the theory) their <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a> would mature. And so instead of being caught up with superficial and kind of unhelpful <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a>, there would be this maturation through actually going into the [[desire]], living it, experiencing, tasting, etc. Following the thread of [[desire]], there would be this maturation until they would get clear and centred on their deepest heart's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a>. So starting with the Mars bars, and eating them and whatever, eventually there would be this funnelling down, a natural maturation process that would happen. Now, that's probably not a fair summary of what she was saying, and I might have misunderstood. But anyway, she seemed to equate [[eros]] and [[desire]].</span>

##### One was more interested in Thanatos
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > ^2-5" data-href="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^2-5" class="internal-link">2-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> (3) · <a data-href="Thanatos" class="internal-link">Thanatos</a> (4) · <a data-href="Death" class="internal-link">Death</a> (4) · <a data-href="Sigmund Freud" class="internal-link">Sigmund Freud</a> · <a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40163/20170118-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_1-40163.mp3#t=10:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Another teacher made the distinction saying, "This is all very well, [[eros]]" (this was a little later in the group), saying, "what _I'm_ more interested in is in <a data-href="Thanatos" class="internal-link">Thanatos</a>_,_" he said. '<a data-href="Thanatos" class="internal-link">Thanatos</a>,' some of you will know, is another Greek word. '<a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a>' is a Greek word. And in, I think it's Freudian psychoanalytic theory, <a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> is sometimes equated with the life instinct (the instinct to want to live), and contrasted with <a data-href="Thanatos" class="internal-link">Thanatos</a> (the drive towards [[death]], the [[death]] instinct), which <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sigmund Freud" data-href="Sigmund Freud" class="internal-link">Freud</a> introduced later into his psychoanalytic theory. This teacher was saying, interestingly, he came to the group to hold the other pole, if you like: "I'm interested in <a data-href="Thanatos" class="internal-link">Thanatos</a>, in the [[death]] instinct." I don't think he meant [[death]], per se; more as in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unfabricating</a> that we were talking about, the movement towards a kind of dissolution, _nibbāna_, in the traditional sense.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Related, but very different to that (and I can't remember what order this happened in) - there were quite a few senior teachers in this group, by the way - another teacher said that the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s primary interest, or he was trying to persuade people that the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s primary interest was in addressing _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mara" data-href="Mara" class="internal-link">Māra</a>_, the sort of primordial, if you like, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Archetype" data-href="Archetype" class="internal-link">archetypal</a> villain in the <a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a>, _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mara" data-href="Mara" class="internal-link">Māra</a>_.

So what the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> is really teaching is "life, live, be in your life," etc., and the sort of elevation of - well, I actually pointed this out to him, but the elevation of this concept of Life, that it becomes a kind of substitute for an idea of God or divine, which this teacher was very much against. But there was this equation of [[eros]] with life, as opposed to [[death]], and the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> was very interested in life, and the sort of praise of life, if you like.</span>

<span class="paragraph">It turned out that the person, I think, who even suggested the topic in general at first, when it came to her turn, what she meant by [[eros]], she was actually quite unclear and sort of said she didn't know. We sort of just tried to elicit from her a little bit, and it turned out that what she really meant was that when she was teaching, she found that she kind of got into a mode where there was very little humour and very little sort of joke-telling, etc. There was not the [[juiciness]] of humour. So that's what _she_ meant. This was a huge range, and I don't think [laughs] we even came to a conclusion about what we were talking about, which is oftentimes a problem with these kind of groups. But that was another thing that was interesting to me: that there was no clarity even about what is meant.</span>

<span class="paragraph">This is why, a little bit, I want to go into this - partly because it's a topic that people are interested in, and maybe especially people who have been practising a long time. Why? Because they recognize the lacuna there, the gap, presumably, in the teachings, around this subject. And secondly, we can't really go into it until we kind of start to say, what are we talking about here? Or can we decide what we're talking about, and see where that leads us?</span>

<span class="paragraph">So [[eros]], as _we_ are using it on this [[retreat]], as _I_ would want to conceive of it, certainly has a relationship with [[desire]], with the notion of [[desire]]. The notion of [[eros]] and the notion of [[desire]] are clearly related. But let us say (and we can come back to this) that [[eros]] is a _kind_ of [[desire]]. It's still very wide, what it can mean, but it's a specific kind of [[desire]]. So a subset of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a> are erotic <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a>, if you like. And [[desire]], if it's not already clear to you or clear from the first few talks that we gave, [[desire]] is very interesting and not simple. <a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a> in the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> is also not simple. I don't think we really went into this in the first three talks, but the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> lists, in these great lists that he comes up with (the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening > Factors of Awakening" data-href="Awakening#Factors of Awakening" class="internal-link">factors of awakening</a>, and this and that), there's a list called the <a data-href="Four bases of power" class="internal-link">Four bases of power</a> - the <a data-href="Four bases of power" class="internal-link">Four bases of power</a>, sometimes of power, or success, or accomplishment.^[SN 51:20] And [[desire]] is one of those. It's listed, and the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> talks about it a lot. If you want _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, if you want to develop the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a>_, if you want to develop the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a>_, if you want [[awakening]], [[desire]] is a basis for that. He lists it and points to it: "This is necessary. It's important to develop this. It's important to give some [[attention]] to this. It's important to be skilful with one's [[desire]]." He does not say, "<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">Just let go</a>.

<span class="paragraph">Anyone just flicking through the <a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a>, the collection of the original <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s teachings, how often words like 'striving' and 'exertion,' etc., come up. I've forgotten the exact Pali words, but he uses the language of 'striving,' of 'ardent [[desire]],' etc., really, _really_ frequently. If you take the example just of his life, he's a paradigm, a paramount example of someone _really_ dedicated, _really_ desiring, with what most people nowadays <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">in our culture</a> would regard as an extreme [[passion]] for, in his case, realization. He taught the <a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a> between - well, actually different kinds of <a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a>, but his <a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a> in terms of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">passion for awakening</a> was not really what most people these days would consider a <a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a>.

<span class="paragraph">So, as I said, all this, what we're talking about on this [[retreat]], and the teachings about [[eros]] and [[desire]], has a context. Now, there are also the contexts of areas and themes in the teachings that have interested me very much over the years, and that I have tried to share with others over the years as well. I've talked in the past - I think, if I remember, there's a talk called "<a data-href="Passion, Desire, and the Path" class="internal-link">Passion, Desire, and the Path</a>"^[Rob Burbea, "Passion, Desire, and the Path" (16 March 2007), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/12343]; one was about "A <a data-href="Wise Relationship to Practice" class="internal-link">Wise Relationship to Practice</a>,"^[Rob Burbea, "A Wise Relationship to Practice" (28 Jan. 2010), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/9538] I think it's called; and "<a data-href="Wise Effort" class="internal-link">Wise Effort</a>,"^[Rob Burbea, "Talk Three: Wise Effort and Wise Attachment" (10 Aug. 2008), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/11516] looking at more the micro-movement of effort and [[desire]] in, for example, _[[samatha]]_ practice and _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ practice and that kind of thing; and other talks I can't remember. I think I might try on this [[retreat]] and do something that might be a little annoying, but hopefully it's more helpful than annoying, and mention other places where you can find more about certain strands or elements of teaching that are involved in what we're talking about. I'm going to mention, but maybe not fill out more, so that if you want more you have a place to look.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Why is it that some people have that [[passion]] and choose a version, among the different versions that are sort of on the spiritual supermarket shelf even within <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a>, choose a version of it that allows their [[passion]], and even allows the [[pain]] that can come with that [[passion]]? It's a [[pain]] the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> talked about. I can't remember his word for it, but the [[pain]] of the contemplative, I think he called it, in a [[sutta]] somewhere in the <a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a> about [[equanimity]].^[MN 137] He doesn't say, in regard to the meditator, the contemplative, who hears about other people [[awakening]], who wants [[awakening]] but is not there yet, he doesn't say, "Just relax. Let go. Don't [[desire]]. Drop it. Too much [[passion]]." He doesn't say that. He said, "Yeah, that's how it is until you realize. What you need to do is keep going until you realize. Then your [[passion]] will be quenched."^[SN 51:15] So it's oftentimes quite a different message that we're getting, or interpretation that we're putting on the teachings.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So why? Why all these differences in people? Is it just differences of personality? <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul-differences</a>, if you like? Is it conditioning, whether that's in terms of personality, or education, or what people have been exposed to, the kinds of teachings, or the kind of culture, or the kind of family? Is it early childhood wounding, for example - that in how one expressed one's [[passion]] and one's [[love]] and one's [[desire]], the nakedness of that that the infant has, often that comes out quite uninhibited in infancy? Is it that there was a wounding there, in school, or with the family, or whatever it is, that caused one to block and inhibit one's [[desire]], one's libido, one's [[passion]]? All of this, actually, we're going to talk about more. To me, these are interesting questions, the psychology involved in all of this: why some people are like that, why others different, why people go for this kind of path, or that kind of path, or that kind of notion of [[awakening]], or whatever it is. I want to include it over the course of this [[retreat]] very much. We'll return to that periodically.</span>

<span class="paragraph">In the past (I think a few years ago), I gave a couple of talks called "The <a data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">Beauty</a> of <a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a>," Part 1 and 2, I think.^[Rob Burbea, "The Beauty of Desire" [Parts 1 and 2] (19 and 26 Nov. 2011), [https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=the+beauty+of+desire](https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=the+beauty+of+desire)] And if I remember, in the second part of that, I introduced something that I discovered in practice, where there's a certain way of practising with [[desire]] - even if it's a [[desire]] not for [[awakening]], for something else - where it might at first be uncomfortable and bring _[[dukkha]]_, but there's a way of practising that doesn't dissolve it, that respects it, opens it up more. ==Practising in that way, actually respecting the [[desire]] and, if you like, empowering it - without necessarily acting on it; we're talking about a [[meditation]] here - practising this way leads to an [[experience]] where the [[desire]] does not bring _[[dukkha]]._ Quite the opposite: it brings a kind of fulfilment and opening of the being.== So again, the whole way we tend to think about [[desire]], and even if it's a good thing, it inherently brings some degree of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> because there's tension - not so simple, not so simple.

<span class="paragraph">In the first three talks, hopefully it was clear that the whole idea of trying to live a life of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">non-clinging</a>, trying to live without [[craving]] and [[clinging]], "just <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a>," etc., in that simplistically understood way, has several problems, which I'm not going to repeat now. So that, too, is part of the context. And also, again, what we're talking about on this [[retreat]] is very much in the context of the exploration, the elaboration, and the expansion of what I've been <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a> (related to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tantra" data-href="Tantra" class="internal-link">tantric</a> practice, but different). I've talked a fair amount already about [[eros]] in the context of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a>. One set of talks I remember - what's it called? - "An Ecology of <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a>," in I think three or four parts^[Rob Burbea, "An Ecology of Love" [Parts 1-4] (21 Dec. 2015), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=an+ecology+of+love+sense+of+the+Earth] - talked about this dynamic which we're really, really going to elaborate on a lot in _this_ [[retreat]], because it's so central, such a powerful <a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a>, and it opens up all kinds of things, allows and gives a basis to all kinds of avenues, what I'm calling the [[soulmaking dynamic]] or the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking dynamic" data-href="Soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">eros-psyche-logos dynamic</a>. I will explain more about that on this [[retreat]], and bring everything back to that quite a bit, but it's already been explored. So again, that's part of the context through <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a>.</span>

##### Eros in this retreat expands on imaginal practice, but also explores the role of eros for the path as a whole

<span class="paragraph">On this [[retreat]], in a way it's similar material to what I've explored before in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a>, but now I want to expand that piece about [[eros]], elaborate more regarding [[eros]] and its place and its potential - both in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a>, what we've been <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a>, but also _in_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a> and _for_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a> as a whole, and what that might mean for <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>, and what kind of paths that opens up. So that's a little bit of the context. But there's more, even, because we could say, why bother? ==Why introduce this other word, [[eros]], when we have lots of words, as we elaborated in part one of the first talk? Why bother? Well, that's a good question. It's really a good question. Do we really need another concept here?==</span>

I'll read you all the email, just because there's so much [[insight]] here in what he's saying. He captures a lot of the themes that we're going to touch on, and highlights their necessity, and in a way, answers this question of "Why bother?" So I'll read it all.

<span class="paragraph">> I'm quite new to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Buddhist path</a>, having only been formally practising for about three years now, but I dived straight into it. I've spent most of the last year as a monk, both in Myanmar and France, before disrobing with the idea of closing my worldly life and ordaining again this upcoming fall.

<span class="paragraph">> Now, obviously, from the monk's perspective, this is the worst thing I could have done. But somehow I can't really buy into that. Not just because romance is so sweet and compelling, but mostly because of my intuition that ==there is something deeper running underneath lust and [[love]], something wider than her and me, something so beautifully alive that maybe it shouldn't be renounced so quickly.== It's that same intuition that flared up every time I have fallen in [[love]]: the feeling that I'm playing a game that is beyond us; that the torrent in my chest is just running through me unaffected by matter or time, untamed by anybody; that ==I'm just here as a temporary vehicle for a [[desire]] that has never begun nor ceased stretching out towards the beloved, so my specific [[love]] [[stories]] become just some personified renditions of a myth essentially unspoken and inexhaustible.==</span>

There was another piece, actually, that this woman that he was involved with - this is part of the problem that initially instigated - this woman that he was involved with was wanting the relationship to be an open one (in other words, to be able to have sex with other people, etc.), that they both were okay with that. She wanted that, and he was very unsure about that, and very ambivalent about that. But I just pointed out to him that actually, although that's certainly an issue to explore and to ponder, whether it ended up being an open relationship or not, and even whether the relationship continued or ended, is actually _not_ the most deeply relevant thing.</span>

##### In the Insight Meditation tradition, sexual energies better not arise

<span class="paragraph">The more fundamental and universal questions he was asking in all this, they won't go away whether or not the relationship's open, or whether or not it continued. So when we say "why bother with all this?", well, that email articulates really, really well one of the reasons. It wasn't enough; the contact we had was not enough to really allow those kind of questions and the wrestling that he's talking about to really be opened up and supported. And hence this [[retreat]], and hence the teachings on this [[retreat]], and the attempt here, because usually in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a> - that's the tradition he's coming from - in terms of sexual <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a> and energies that arise, you know, as we talked about, either they're just regarded essentially as _kilesa_, defilement, or distraction in [[meditation]]. Or there's a sort of slightly more charitable and open, softer view that just says: notice them, allow them, certainly don't encourage them. So notice, allow, in this spirit of openness, but not the encouragement. Sexual and erotic-<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a> and energies are _not_ regarded as having any real positive place on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>; only so much in the context that _anything_ has a place on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a> because we're attempting, in a certain framing or vision of what <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> is, to be open to all things. Still, underneath that (this is the subtext), we can be open to all things, but it's _better_ if these things don't arise. It's easier, and basically just kind of let go of them. Maybe there's a kind of view of equality: "They're just like anything else to be opened to, to be let go of." But essentially it's like everything else: don't <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a>, don't get involved, don't create anything there.</span>

##### Our definition of "eros" includes sexuality, but it's more fundamental and often more subtle

<span class="paragraph">So again, there's a kind of lacuna there, certainly around [[sexuality]] and that kind of erotics. But I really want to say, when _we_ use the word [[eros]], it _includes_ [[sexuality]] in what we're meaning by [[eros]]. So we include [[sexuality]]. ==We include sexual attraction, sexual [[energy]], etc. But it's actually much, much more than that. We're talking about something much more fundamental, and also that can be both very intense and very subtle.== Well, sexual [[energy]] and sexual attraction can also be very subtle, but even more subtle than that. We're talking about something, as a notion, that's actually more basic and often more subtle.</span>

#### 1. Because eros is already active in our life, and by delineating it we get a handle on it
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > ^9-3" data-href="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^9-3" class="internal-link">9-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> (4) · <a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a> · <a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a> · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">Delineations</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">But again, you know, not to over-labour the point, but why introduce this concept of [[eros]]? Why distinguish something called '[[eros]]' from [[craving]] or greed or [[desire]] in general? Well, it's there already. <a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a>, as _we're_ meaning that term, what _we_ mean by [[eros]], is already functioning every day in our lives. {It's already part of our [[experience]], as we'll explain. Making the distinction draws out something that otherwise might not be so clear to us.} And, as I said, that might shut doors if it's not so clear, if we don't draw it out. Making a distinction, or any kind of distinction, amplifies something. By distinguishing this from that, A from B, A and B get amplified, or one of A and B gets amplified, gets magnified. It's like you get to put it under a magnifying glass. It gets clearer. ==Setting it apart allows us to investigate it, to take it as a theme of investigation. If I don't <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">delineate</a> it in the first place, I can't take it as a theme of investigation.==</span>

##### Eros is connected to divinity, cosmopoesis, soulmaking (to be covered later)
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > ^9-4" data-href="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^9-4" class="internal-link">9-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> (2) · <a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> (5) · <a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a> (2) · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> (2) · <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a> (3) · <a data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">Divinity</a> (4) · <a data-href="Meaningfulness" class="internal-link">Meaningfulness</a> · <a data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">Dimensionality</a> · <a data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">Beauty</a> · <a data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">Passion</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">Cosmology</a> (4) · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">The delineation is the beginning of opening something up, like a - what would an [[image]] be? I'm not sure if this would work as an [[image]], but like a tear, or like getting your foot in the door, you can begin then to pry open the door, or tearing a fabric, a veil, to reveal something. ==Setting it apart allows us to investigate it, to become interested in it, and then we can see how it works. What is this thing? How does it work? And where does it lead, this thing that we're going to call eros?== Because, and this is one of our central contentions, [[eros]] will lead to different experiences, to different ends, than [[craving]] leads to. It leads to ends and experiences other than the ones [[craving]] leads to. It opens up, if you like, regions of [[soul]], to use a certain language. <a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> is very connected with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a>, with what we're going to call '[[soulmaking]].' I'll explain more what we mean by that, but for now, let's just say the widening and deepening of a sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a>, the widening and deepening and diversification of our sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a>. But also this word, [[soulmaking]], has much to do with [[meaningfulness]], and resonance, and depth, and [[dimensionality]], [[beauty]], and all kinds of things. <a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> is connected with a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sense of divinity</a>, and with what we've been <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a> in past <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a>: the very sense we have, the vision, the [[perception]], of the world, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmos</a> we live in, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmos</a> about us, our very sense of existence. We're going to go into these terms, [[divinity]], <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a>, [[soulmaking]], etc., later in much more detail, because they're very woven into this whole theme of [[eros]].</span>

#### 2. Opening to the recognition of the sacredness of eros itself

<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40163/20170118-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_1-40163.mp3#t=48:12" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So that's one reason. It's in our life already, [[eros]]. We already [[experience]] it. We just need to draw it out and investigate it and see where it leads, because it _does_ lead to somewhere other than where what we might call '[[craving]]' leads to. A second reason why, why make this delineation, is to hopefully establish, or at least highlight the potential of, opening to a recognition of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a> of [[eros]] itself. Again, this is something we're going to come back to a lot: the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a> of [[eros]] itself. We can see that, and it's very different to see [[eros]] as sacred rather than as a defilement. And that includes also the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a>, or at least the potential <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a>, of [[sexuality]]. ==<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">Sacredness</a> never resides in this or that object or thing; we sacralize. We make something or other sacred through our relationship with it. So there's the possibility of sacralizing [[sexuality]], rather than just viewing [[eros]] or [[sexuality]] as a defilement, or as leading inevitably to defilement.==</span>

##### All this is not really adequately addressed in the Dharma at present
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > ^10-2" data-href="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^10-2" class="internal-link">10-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> (2) · <a data-href="Sexuality" class="internal-link">Sexuality</a> (2) · <a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a> (3) · <a data-href="Precepts" class="internal-link">Precepts</a> · <a data-href="Romantic love" class="internal-link">Romantic love</a> (3) · <a data-href="Relationships" class="internal-link">Relationships</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> (4) · <a data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">Passion</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">All this, as I said, is not really so adequately addressed in the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> at present, for the most part. We talk about [[sexuality]] and [[desire]]. We talk a lot about [[desire]], but in a negative way mostly. We talk about [[sexuality]], but very little, except in terms of ethical prohibitions - for example, the [[precepts]] - or it's admitted, within sort of typically assumed limits, that it's an aspect of life (predominately lay life, but still there for monastics). But there isn't really this exploration, inquiry. It's not really opened up, as I said, as part of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>. As we mentioned already at least once, you know, most people have a [[desire]] for [[romantic love]], or most people are involved in [[relationships]], or in marriages, perhaps, and a finer discrimination is needed there. This is not _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ . ==I cannot reduce a [[romantic love]] relationship or a marriage to _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ . There's something more involved, or that needs to be involved. Part of that 'more' is what we're going to call [[eros]], what we're <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a> eros.== If I'm interested in that, if I'm really interested in bringing a fullness of investigation, and if I'm really interested in [[romantic love]] and romantic partnerships being really integrally part of the practice, then this brings all kinds of inquiries. For example, in a long-term relationship, what keeps the [[eros]] alive? What stifles it? What kills it? What erodes it? What just allows it to fritter away? And what keeps the [[eros]] alive in a long-term relationship?</span>

#### 3. Opening a direction of investigation
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > ^10-3" data-href="0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^10-3" class="internal-link">10-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Sexuality" class="internal-link">Sexuality</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> (4) · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> (3) · <a data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">Divinity</a> · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> (3) · <a data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">Dependent Origination</a> · <a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a> · <a data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">Fabrication</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So there's that second reason, the re-sacralizing of [[sexuality]], [[love]], but also of [[eros]], and making it more part of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>, integrally, fully, richly. Really, with all this, a third reason why, what are we doing, why make this discrimination of something called [[eros]], is related to what I said before: I'm interested in creating or opening an area or a direction of investigation. I certainly don't want to just sort of, for instance, _assert_ something like the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a> of [[eros]]: "I am telling you [[eros]] is sacred," and then, you know, so what? Some people will agree, some people will disagree. It's pointless. What I'm much more interested in is a domain and a dimension for a much freer, more open and penetrating inquiry, <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> inquiry. ==And always in <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> inquiry, always, there's something really fundamental to see: there's a principle that how we view something - always we see that how we view something affects the [[perception]] of that 'something.' The ideas that I have, the preconceptions, the conceptions, the relationship with the 'something' that I'm investigating, the area of inquiry, affects my [[perception]] of that 'something,' and affects the related experiences that unfold, that can unfold, or that will unfold. All that's to do with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a>. The view, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a>, affects. It shapes the [[perception]], fabrication.== We've talked about that. It's part of what we talked about before.</span>

<span class="paragraph">We really have to see this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a>. How I view something affects my [[perception]] of that thing, so that must be part of the way that I'm inquiring. And a part of that, a part of the investigation, is perhaps this question: what happens, how does it affect this whole thing called [[eros]], if I view it as sacred? Even if I just _try_ and view it, even just a little, just entertain the idea that it might be sacred? So that's a sort of subset of a subset of the investigation: what happens _if_ ? I'm not asserting anything here. This is all really in the spirit of investigation.</span>

You can have, there exists, there arises for us, an erotic connection or erotic connections (plural) with the earth; with a tree, or a piece of land; with the stars; with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmos</a>; erotic connection with the divine; erotic connection/relationship with the senses; an erotic sensibility, an erotic connection with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Materialism" data-href="Materialism" class="internal-link">materiality</a>; certainly with another <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a>, but not only humans - with other living beings. Certainly also not just with others, but we can have - and hopefully we _do_ have, and we're going to elaborate on this - an erotic connection with oneself, or erotic connections (plural) with oneself and aspects of oneself, faces of oneself, or the selves' faces, or self faces, whatever. ==There can be and hopefully is an erotic view, an erotic connection, with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>, and with the idea, or the vision, the [[fantasy]], the notion, the concept of awakening.== Certainly always there's an erotic connection with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figures</a>, even when it seems like there isn't. And there's even the possibility of erotic connection with ideas and concepts.</span>

##### Eros involves energy, embodiment, the imaginal, and logos

<span class="paragraph">So [[eros]] pervades very broadly. We mean much more than '[[sexuality]]' here. <a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> can also be or can seem to be, at different times, primarily energetic, or primarily physical, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">embodied</a>, if you like, or primarily [[imaginal]], or primarily intellectual. It can, at different times, be or seem to be primarily all those things. Actually, I would say it always involves all of these aspects. <a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> always involves [[energy]], what we're going to call the '[[energy body]],' and the energetics; it involves some kind of [[embodiment]], or relationship with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> and views of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of the body</a>; it always involves the [[imaginal]]; and it always involves ideation, intellect, concept, what we're going to call '[[logos]].' It always involves all that. So it's already something multidimensional, and we're going to go into this more. As I said, ==whenever there is a sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a>, that kind of richness, resonance, depth, [[dimensionality]], [[beauty]], [[meaningfulness]], in our existence, in the being, whenever there is [[soulmaking]], <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a> in our existence, [[eros]] is involved. <a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> is involved whenever there is soulmaking.==</span>

##### Different people, different characters, also how eros expresses in their lives

<span class="paragraph">Now, I think it's fair to say, I think it's obvious and maybe important to say as well, that different people at different times will find these investigations that we're going into around [[eros]] and [[soulmaking]] more or less interesting. So this, to me, is interesting in itself. It seems to me, it does seem to me, that ==people differ in the flavours or the characters, if you like, of the ways [[eros]], or libido, or if we say <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Eros" data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">life force</a>, expresses in their lives. They differ in the flavours, the characters, the ways [[eros]] expresses in their lives. The fire, if you like, if [[eros]] is a kind of fire, the fire of [[eros]] looks and burns differently.== People's [[soul]]-fire burns and looks differently, one to another. There's quite a range there, you know - the flaming [[passion]]. And also at different times, a flaming [[passion]], a very steady, quiet, small, but unquenchable flame; or the raging fire, whatever, leaping from one thing to another, the flames. It looks and burns differently.</span>

##### People also different in the strength and depth of eros itself

<span class="paragraph">But people also differ, it seems to me at least, in the amount, strength, and depth, if you like, of [[eros]], of the [[eros]] or the libido that flows through them in their life or into them. Differ in the amount, strength, or depth. So this also is complex. Some people are like this, and some people are like that. There's a range. But it's also a fact (we touched on this before) that, for all kinds of reasons which also are interesting, ==[[eros]] and libido or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Eros" data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">life force</a> _can_ be and often _is_ blocked in our lives in different ways==, inhibited at times or in certain situations, or certain expressions or along certain lines are blocked, whereas others are free. Or there can be a more chronic and more pervasive blocking or inhibition of the [[eros]] and the libido. It's not so much that person really, so to speak, _is_ just a certain character or style; something is blocking or inhibited, or crushed or whatever, there.</span>

##### Eros is a necessary part of soulmaking

<span class="paragraph">Still, despite all that, and despite the varying differences of interest between different people at different times and all that, I'd say that [[eros]] is a necessary, an integral aspect or element of what we're going to be <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a> '[[soulmaking]],' what we have in the past called '[[soulmaking]].' And therefore, an inquiry into [[eros]] is important for anyone interested, at all interested or devoted to [[soulmaking]].

##### On this retreat, the intention is to open doors and offer a map

<span class="paragraph">On this [[retreat]], on this course, the intention of the teachings is really, if you like, to open a door, or open doors. I mentioned that it's possible that certain doors are actually shut or even locked shut in the way that we're conceiving - not just of <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, but of life, of existence, and of who we are, and what the world is, and what existence is. So the aim, broadly speaking, of these teachings, this set of teachings, is to open doors, and to sketch - at least sketch, begin to sketch - a path for those who would move through these doors and move into new territory, for those who would like to travel certain paths, and to offer a map - at least the beginnings of a map, loosely speaking - a frame of reference, and light certain beacons for navigation for those also who already find themselves in uncharted territory around [[eros]], around [[desire]]. They're already there, and they need some kind of orientation, some kind of way of thinking and ways of practising, practical tools, subtleties of practical differentiations and navigation and steering, as all practices need.</span>

##### The sense of the holiness of desire is tricky, so help is needed

<span class="paragraph">Some, as we mentioned, already see that maybe the more usual or narrow sort of ways we can interpret the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understandings</a> of <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, or frameworks, may not be enough, or _are_ not enough, to open up this territory. Some people already sense - as in the beautiful email I read earlier - already sense a holiness in [[desire]], the holiness of [[desire]] in life or in certain areas or directions of [[desire]]. And also in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a>, this is very common. They sense that holiness, but it's tricky. It's tricky, and not easy, and it's complex, and it's rich, and help is needed, and a <a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a> is needed, and tools are needed, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a>, and practice instructions are needed, etc. - both on the cushion, and in life, and in relationship.</span>

##### These teachings fit into the ones about imaginal practice and soulmaking, but also those more typical Dharma teachings about craving and dukkha

<span class="paragraph">Again, back to context: these teachings sit within a larger context of wanting to open a path that integrates a lot of elements that we've already talked about over the last few years - <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a>, [[soulmaking]], <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a>, this re-enchantment of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmos</a>, the [[poetry]] of [[perception]], the experiences and the senses of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a>, of [[divinity]], [[eros]]. All this we touched before, and in fact, I'm going to - probably in the next talk - attempt a kind of brief glossary of all these terms. Hopefully that's helpful too. This [[retreat]], as I said, is a slightly different angle. It's coming from the angle of [[eros]], emphasizing more the [[eros]], and expanding on more what that means. But all this, hopefully you can see how it is integrated with, it sits fitted into, tessellated with, our usual - maybe the more typical - <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma teachings</a> about [[craving]], and [[letting go]] of [[craving]], and how [[craving]] leads to _[[dukkha]]_ .</span>

<span class="paragraph">It sits with that, alongside, mixed with that, in complement to that, and also the much more radical teachings about investigating [[clinging]] and the whole spectrum of what that notion, that word, means, =='[[clinging]],' and all the subtleties and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Beauty" data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">beauties</a> of working with that in practice: [[letting go]] of [[clinging]], moving up and down the spectrum of [[clinging]], and seeing what it does to the [[fabrication]] of the [[perception]] of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self, other, world, time</a>, etc.==, really going deeply in practice and in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>, in the realization, the [[insight]], into the teachings of [[dependent origination]] at a very deep level - not the more common level; the very deep level - and unfolding, if you like, the [[experience]] of the <a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a> and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of all things</a>, so that existence is opened, and radical [[freedom]], radical opening of the sense of existence. And also (I've talked about this before) ==that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> of [[emptiness]] ... well, let's say this: it can provide a non-realist basis for all these other explanations and explorations that we're going into.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">So that to the degree, to the depth that we kind of have taken to heart, understood the teachings of [[emptiness]], how much they've penetrated the heart and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>, to that degree we can really practise a flexibility of [[ways of looking]], and also of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a>. We can entertain different ideas and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a> without having to believe in the reality of any of it, that any of these [[ways of looking]] are revealing a reality of, "This is how the world is. This is how I am. This is what the [[nature]] of things is," or "This idea, this <a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a>, is the truth of things." So there's a real facility and flexibility of just moving between [[ways of looking]], all kinds of [[ways of looking]], a really broad range, and all kinds of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a>. It's woven into, integrated - ==these teachings are integrated into the usual <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma teachings</a> about [[craving]] and [[letting go]] and releasing _[[dukkha]]_, and the much deeper teachings about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a> and [[emptiness]], and that forms a non-realist basis.== ==All that is partly what allows us to open up teachings of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a> and, if you like, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tantra" data-href="Tantra" class="internal-link">tantric</a> teachings== - although I make a distinction there, but [[tantra]] _is_ based on that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> of [[emptiness]], absolutely.

##### It's not eclecticism but integrated into an inevitable way the Dharma unfolds

<span class="paragraph">So I hope you can see in all of this, and if not right now, at least at some point, you can see that this isn't really an [[eclecticism]]. I'm not sort of interested in just drawing different things together, tossing them in a pot for the sake of being interesting, or just being restless in a more superficial way. I hope you can see at some point how integrated, as I said, all these teachings are and, if you like, how necessary, how inevitable many of these teachings are, because, as I said, one way of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> unfolds a certain depth and a certain possibility, and that just keeps unfolding in a kind of very necessary way. So they're necessary to what's gone before, but also necessary to our existence and to our practice and for the future.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Maybe more typical <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> psychologies - let's say just the teaching of the links of [[dependent origination]]; we talked a bit about that. ==One of the immense strengths of the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s teaching and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma teaching</a> is that he kind of gives us a set of concepts, and in a way, they become [[ways of looking]]. That's what these concepts are; they become [[ways of looking]]. But they serve to simplify. So <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> concepts serve to simplify, simplify because they <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricate</a> less.== When I use a certain set of concepts, for instance, there's less _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a>_ . There's less of this crazy complexifying and nonsense-making, if you like, entanglement. But at a deeper level, too, they simplify in the sense that the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> concepts become [[ways of looking]] that move towards less and less [[fabrication]], and less and less [[fabrication]] is a state of simplicity. He's saying, "Don't think about _this_ . Don't think about _that_ . Think in this way, and look in this way. Adopt these [[ways of looking]]," and there's a disentangling, a certain amount of simplifying - both of the [[ways of looking]] (by constraining the [[ways of looking]] to certain concepts), but also then in what is seen, of course. There's a simplifying in the [[perception]] of things. And that simplifying just goes deeper and deeper. So not just the simplicity of the 'is-ness,' the so-called '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness > Suchness" data-href="Emptiness#Suchness" class="internal-link">suchness</a>' of things and the vividness of that, but the simplicity of our life, and then the simplicity of [[perception]] _beyond_ the thing-ness of things, as we go deeper and deeper into unfabricating, and eventually into something that is, in effect, so simple that even 'is' or 'is not' doesn't apply to it: the <a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a>.</span>

##### The soul wants disentangling, but also something else

<span class="paragraph">So again, if I use a certain language, the [[soul]], the [[psyche]], wants and needs, obviously, a kind of disentangling. It certainly wants that journey into perceiving less [[fabrication]]. But there are, so to speak, other <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a> or strata of the [[soul]] (we could use that language), of the [[psyche]], that want something else. And so other <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a> and [[delineations]] become necessary, rather than just simplicity, simplicity, simplicity, unfabricating, unfabricating, unfabricating, unfabricating, <a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a>. Rather than just the simplifying of that direction, which is so much the power of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma practice</a> and <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> concepts, other <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a>, other [[delineations]], become necessary. What is the difference between _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a>_ and [[fantasy]] or [[image]] in the way _we're_ using it? Difference between daydreaming and [[fantasy]] and [[image]]? What's the difference between [[soulmaking]] and the kind of simplicity of [[freedom]] that I've just talked about? What's the difference between [[eros]] and [[craving]], or [[desire]] and [[eros]]? What's the difference between [[eros]] and [[love]], or the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a>_ ?</span>

<span class="paragraph">I'm going to make this contention (it's something I'm really going to come back to a lot on this [[retreat]]): something in us, something in the [[soul]], wants to know, wants to [[experience]], not just [[oneness]], not just transcendence or the <a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a>, nor just (quote) 'life as it is,' as if there really even _is_ a 'life as it is,' as if such a thing exists, such a thing is possible to behold. We don't _just_ want [[oneness]], transcendence, or that freshness of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Attention" data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">bare attention</a>, certainly.

<span class="paragraph">So we need a kind of more elaborate, you could say, or a slightly more sophisticated psychology. We need a <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> psychology that both recognizes that which is already present, but which needs to be, as I said, drawn out, amplified a little more, recognized - the fact, for example, that ==[[eros]] is more than _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ ; it's not the same as [[craving]]; it's not even just <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> [[desire]], _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">hitacchanda</a>,_ or [[desire]] that leads to less suffering.== We need to recognize something that's already present in our life, that hasn't been drawn [[attention]] to yet, highlighted, drawn out, investigated. And ==we need a slightly more elaborate <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> psychology because of the different kinds of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a> and the different realms of [[experience]] which are slightly more involved.== A psychology that involves concepts like [[eros]] can open up for us, without which either these realms don't open up, these directions don't open up, or they just get dismissed.</span>
