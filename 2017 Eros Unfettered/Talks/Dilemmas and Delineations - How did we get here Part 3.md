Interesting footnote, added to the [[0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#4-1]]

> Editor's note: please see the [[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Hermeneutical circle|beginning of Part 2 of this talk]]  for more information on the caveats of definitions. Rob wishes to encourage steering a middle course between, on the one hand, the illusion of comfort one might get from having precise definitions, and on the other hand, a too-quick dismissal of 'conceptuality' and definitions that are too loose - so loose that they let in too much, and the power of the idea is lost. This is tricky, and particularly for beginners, who, in the sea of new ideas and practices that they are being exposed to, might understandably want 'textbook'-like definitions to hold on to, but which may then become rigid, etc. In Soulmaking Dharma, all concepts, as well as images, need to have 'soft and elastic edges.'

## Paragraphs
[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 -|plain list]]

##### A whole web of relationships and implied meanings around "eros"
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > ^1-1" data-href="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#^1-1" class="internal-link">1-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> (2) · <a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a> (2) · <a data-href="Relationships" class="internal-link">Relationships</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40165/20170120-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_3-40165.mp3#t=00:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">As I've already said, what _we_ mean by '[[eros]],' the way we are using that term, is actually woven in and related to and indissolubly bound up with and connected to a whole range of other terms that we're using with specific meanings to form a kind of larger <a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a>. There's a whole web of [[relationships]] and implied meanings there, so we can't really unpack what we mean by '[[eros]]' without beginning to say and include more of those terms, and say a little bit about those other notions, and a little bit about what the [[relationships]] are. But this whole edifice, this whole architecture, <a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a>, is something we'll unfold gradually. There's quite a lot to it, in a way.</span>

##### It's quite a large body of work, which would puzzle anyone just picking one talk
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > ^1-2" data-href="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (2) · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> · <a data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">Dependent Origination</a> · <a data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">Imaginal</a> · <a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> (2) · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> · <a data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">Divinity</a> · <a data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">Cosmology</a> · <a data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhism</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40165/20170120-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_3-40165.mp3#t=01:08" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">I want to begin doing that now. And just before I do, you know, just to say: I'm aware that I'm referring to what is now really quite a large <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> of work. I think about all the material on [[emptiness]] and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a>, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a>, and re-enchantment and all that - it's actually quite a large <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> of work together with this piece, this course on [[eros]]. So if someone who is coming from the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a> tradition or something like that were to just pick a talk at random and listen to that talk, they would probably be just baffled, puzzled, probably even maybe shocked, perhaps even outraged: "What is _this_? What is he talking about? What are they talking about? How on earth did we get _here_, these words '[[soul]],' '[[eros]],' '[[divinity]],' even the word 'God,' '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a>' (whatever _that_ means)? What on earth is he talking about, and how did he get there? This is really pretty far out. Is this <a data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhism</a>?"</span>

##### What soul-styles can we approach this material with
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > ^1-3" data-href="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">Fantasy</a> · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> · <a data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">Imaginal</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40165/20170120-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_3-40165.mp3#t=02:33" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Now. [laughs] I've touched on that last question before. It may be, in some respects, quite an interesting question. In other respects, it might not be interesting at all. What's more interesting about it to me is, why is a person asking such a question, and what assumptions and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasies</a> are operating for them? And in our language, what <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-styles</a> can we approach this material with and its relationship to, let's say, more conventional interpretations of <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>? I've talked about that before; I'm not going to repeat it here. But just to say: ==I would say this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> of material needs listening to, studying, practising with - all that material around the [[emptiness]], but certainly around the [[imaginal]] material, in series. In other words, it adds up. In that way, only then can a person kind of see and understand what is meant in these teachings.==</span>

---
##### There is a natural evolution of the material
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > ^1-4" data-href="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">Phenomenology</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">Personhood</a> · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> (2) · <a data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">Phenomenon</a> · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> · <a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a> (2) · <a data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">Fabrication</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40165/20170120-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_3-40165.mp3#t=03:51" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">But we'll also, hopefully, understand - if a person does that, listens, studies, ponders, and practises in series - that there is kind of, I would say, an almost inevitable or natural evolution of this material now. It evolved, if you like, naturally. ==The doors were presented one after another. The consequences, the avenues, were travelled in a kind of logical or inevitable order - one [[insight]], one opening led to another, etc., all based on what we might call the '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a> approach,' which is how I would base my approach to the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>. It's very, very simple, starting with very, very simple practices, including the ideas of [[mindfulness]], but not based on the usual assumptions.== This is what makes a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a> approach. It's not based on the usual assumptions, but based on just, what do I have as a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a>? I have [[experience]]. I have what appears to me. '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">Phenomena</a>' means <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a>. And just basing it on, "This is experienced. Now, what can I discover about [[experience]]?" And introducing into that very quickly - one discovers, "I can look at it this way, and I can look at it that way. I can relate to it this way, that way," so the ideas of [[ways of looking]] and [[fabrication]] eventually come out of that, because I see some [[ways of looking]] <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricate</a> differently than others, [as] we touched on.</span>

---
##### Very simple practices and the suspension of usual assumptions lead to the availability to look in different ways
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > ^2-1" data-href="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> · <a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a> · <a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (3)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40165/20170120-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_3-40165.mp3#t=05:30" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So all this unfolds. Very, very simple practices, just _not_ based on the usual assumptions, just suspending them, opening them, relating to what actually is here - [[experience]] is here, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a> is here - without other assumptions. All this leads to other concepts, other ways of framing what's happening, and out of that comes a [[freedom]], and certain <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a>, or the availability to look in different ways and to conceive in different ways. If one doesn't understand all that, and see it through practice, almost like stage by stage, probably a person won't understand what we're saying now in these teachings - probably; there are always exceptions, of course. Without that practice and without those <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understandings</a> and those <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a>, there's not going to be an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>. So that's one thing.</span>

---
##### "Divinity" is a whole range of experiences
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > ^2-2" data-href="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> · <a data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">Divinity</a> (4) · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> (4) · <a data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">Dimensionality</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40165/20170120-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_3-40165.mp3#t=06:37" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">A second thing is, related, regarding these words like, for instance, '[[soul]]' or '[[divinity]]' or 'God,' this is interesting, why some people react to these words. Just to point out, everyone - unless you're a real weirdo [laughs] - ==everyone uses the word self: I, you, self, etc. And everyone experiences selves. Everyone experiences selves - their own self or selves, and the selves of others. It's just the same, or rather it's similar with the notion of [[divinity]]. We're talking about [[experience]], okay? Just as 'self' is a word that we use, an [[experience]], so is '[[divinity]]' - or rather, '[[divinity]]' is a whole range of experiences, a whole range of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a> of experiences, if you like, that will become evident, that will appear in one's [[experience]], _if_ we do not block, dismiss, or rule it out.== In other words, if I'm closed to the very notion of it, just a priori absolutely no way, rule it out, and if I don't open my practice in a certain way, I _won't_ have that [[experience]], and then it will seem like, "What are you talking about?", or "You're talking about something you're making up," or "It's not real," etc.</span>

---
##### Ideas about divinity are historically and culturally contingent
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > ^2-3" data-href="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">Divinity</a> (2) · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">Dominant culture</a> (2) · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> (2) · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">Centre</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40165/20170120-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_3-40165.mp3#t=08:12" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So we use the word, and we're referring to a whole range of experiences, just like self. And just like self, the experiences of [[divinity]] or [[soul]] and the ideas of it, we acknowledge just like self are historically and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">culturally contingent</a>. The selves that you and I [[experience]] now and assume to be real, the kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">modernist self</a> of Western civilization, was not in many ways at all similar to [[the self]] that the people that the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> was addressing 2,500 years ago in India would have experienced. A lot of what we take for granted, and the complexity, and the kinds of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">interiority</a>, just didn't exist for them. Same with medieval Christendom - very different. So just like self, experiences and ideas of [[soul]] or [[divinity]] are historically and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">culturally contingent</a>, conditioned. We acknowledge that, absolutely.</span>

<span class="paragraph">If it seems to someone listening, if it seems like, "Okay, but one of those, [[the self]], refers to a reality, and the others, like [[soul]] and [[divinity]], are just <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metaphysics" data-href="Metaphysics" class="internal-link">metaphysical</a> speculations. They're unnecessary, they're unreal, and they're ungrounded," well, such a bias or assumption may just be reflecting a kind of indoctrination or brainwashing, if you like. The assumptions there and the actual [[experience]] may be determined by just what is the current dominant _Weltanschauung_, world-view, of Western modernist society, culture. It's not so much that a person saying that has any very deep [[insight]] or radical, cutting, innovative idea. Actually, they're just adopting, indoctrinated by, the assumptions of the current dominant world-view, and their [[experience]] and their assumptions are determined primarily by that.</span>

##### Soul, God, divinity, self, are empty on many levels

<span class="paragraph">But even more than that, again, just like the word 'self' and the notion of [[the self]] and the [[experience]] of [[the self]], notions of [[soul]], God, [[divinity]], are empty in many other ways apart from just being historically and culturally conditioned and contingent. There are many ways to reveal the [[emptiness]] of [[the self]], and on many, many different levels. I've talked and written a lot about that. The same is true of [[soul]], God, [[divinity]]: empty, and in many ways, and at many levels. Now, someone with a little bit of [[insight]] will say, or maybe a lot of [[insight]] will say, "I use the language 'self.' I use that term. But I know it's empty." And again, same regarding '[[divinity]]' and '[[soul]]' and 'God,' etc. We use the language, but we know it's empty. ==Someone with perhaps broader [[insight]] will also say something like, "Although it's ultimately empty, it's important to respect [[the self]] and to care for [[the self]]." Okay, so there's a psychological <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> there that's quite important. But again, just the same regarding [[divinity]] and [[soul]]: although it's ultimately empty, it's important to respect the [[soul]] (what does that mean?), and to care for the [[soul]] (what does that mean?).==</span>

##### Even something like "matter" is quickly revealed to be without secure foundations
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > ^3-1" data-href="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#^3-1" class="internal-link">3-1</a>**: _<a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">And we can press this a little further. If we were to ask someone, this hypothetical person who uses happily words like 'self,' or 'matter' (which is almost unavoidable, another unavoidable word), or 'life' (some people use that quite a lot: life this and life that), and if we were to ask someone, "What do you _mean_ when you say 'self'? What is [[the self]]? And what is matter? What do you mean by 'matter'?", at first, they would just sort of point: "Well, I mean this, or I mean that, or I mean this here." [knocks on something] Or life - they might sweep their hands around the room or around the outside or whatever. But if you just said, "Yes, but what do you mean by that?", and you kept pushing this question, probing with the question, without a doubt, it would pretty quickly reveal just how vague the notions of self, certainly the notions of life, and even matter are; how full of assumptions, how often not well thought out, full of assumptions/presumptions that don't really bear much scrutiny, much probing, and that can be pretty quickly revealed to be without secure foundations. Even matter - you just have to know, well, maybe a fair amount about modern physics. ==It's like, "Matter? It's the most obvious thing," but at a certain point, hmm, what are we actually talking about here? And what, when we talk about it, are we assuming and presuming? And what is the basis for assuming that? Can we be absolutely secure in those assumptions? Or we find out that it's resting on a set of assumptions, or the definition itself - of self, of matter, of whatever it is - is full of contradictions.==</span>

##### There is a kind of incoherence about every concept or experience

<span class="paragraph">All this applies equally to notions of [[divinity]] and [[soul]]. They're vague notions. They rest on other assumptions. Any assumptions, you push them deep enough, and you're going to come to something that you just have to assume without knowing it's an absolute truth - in other words, it has no secure foundations. And a lot of notions actually end up being kind of circular in the definition, as you'll see when we talk about [[soul]], etc. And in fact, that's probably true about everything, that there's a kind of assumptionality and vagueness and kind of incoherence or circularity, self-contradictoriness, about everything - anything you might name or point to or use as a concept or [[experience]].</span>

<span class="paragraph">Okay, so all that as a kind of precursor. And I'm also aware, of course, that, as I said, there's a lot of material here. There's a lot of material on this [[retreat]], and then you add it to the other <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a>, and the whole thing about [[emptiness]] and the [[imaginal]] - it's really quite a lot. And it's hard, you know. I appreciate it's hard to kind of keep it all in [[mind]]. Especially hard, I mean, if you're not practising with this material in a really exploratory way. And also a lot of these ideas are not necessarily always so simple or easy to understand. So I fully appreciate that.</span>

##### This talk is somewhere between an exploration of the whole web of ideas and a glossary

<span class="paragraph">And by now what's happened is, someone very often says, "What do you mean when you say X, or when you say Y, or when you say '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a>'?" And I _know_ that that person has heard me explain it or unfold it at maybe even some length in other talks in the past, and yet still they're asking. So this is very normal, very understandable. Partly, what I want to do now in exploring this web is also to - hopefully it can function as somewhere between a kind of exploration of the whole web of ideas, and a glossary, a kind of glossary of terms, which is a pretty strange thing to try and do in a talk, in a recorded talk format, rather than a book, where you can just flip to that page and quickly look it up, but I'm hoping it will be helpful. I'm hoping you'll just remember this is the glossary talk, and I can just go there and find it, and it's about this time in or whatever. But it is pretty strange as an idea, so I hope it's helpful. I hope it's not too dry. Hopefully it will serve.</span>

##### Twenty terms

<span class="paragraph">So I made a list of twenty terms. It's also strange because each of these terms, I'm going to be pretty brief. That's the whole point, trying to be quite brief. But each of these terms refer to a wide range of [[experience]] and the things I've talked about at much more length, so it's not always easy to kind of sum them up very succinctly or as succinctly as possible. So somewhere between a very brief glossary, and a sort of looking at the [[relationships]] and filling it out a little bit. All righty? So twenty terms.^[Editor's note: please see the beginning of Part 2 of this talk for more information on the caveats of definitions. Rob wishes to encourage steering a middle course between, on the one hand, the illusion of comfort one might get from having precise definitions, and on the other hand, a too-quick dismissal of 'conceptuality' and definitions that are too loose - so loose that they let in too much, and the power of the idea is lost. This is tricky, and particularly for beginners, who, in the sea of new ideas and practices that they are being exposed to, might understandably want 'textbook'-like definitions to hold on to, but which may then become rigid, etc. In Soulmaking Dharma, all concepts, as well as images, need to have 'soft and elastic edges.']</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(1)** Number one is - actually, we just used it a minute or two ago - the **<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a> approach.** '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">Phenomena</a>' in Greek (_phainómena_) means '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a>,' 'that which appears.' Now, in my life, as I said, what I have is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a>. ==The assumption that this or that is underneath <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a>, or it's really matter, or all <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a>/<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a> come from the brain, these are all assumptions. What I have is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a>/<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a>. I use the word <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a>, experiences, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a> interchangeably.== So what I have is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a>, what I have is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a>, what I have is experiences. That's what I have as a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a>. I don't go then, in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a> approach, and add the assumption that everything comes from the neurophysiology of the brain, and that's what gives rise to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a>, etc. And I don't also come from a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metaphysics" data-href="Metaphysics" class="internal-link">metaphysical</a> perspective that first there is God or beingness or whatever or something like that. It's just there is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a>. Let's just relate to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a> and see what we can find out.</span>

<span class="paragraph">That's the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a> approach. Why it's so powerful is that, for me, it's a very powerful way into <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> [[emptiness]] and also the [[imaginal]]. One of the sort of proto-phenomenologists, if you like, <a data-href="William James" class="internal-link">William James</a>, the psychologist and philosopher, for him, anything that arose in [[experience]] was worthy of a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a> approach. That includes <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a>. That includes things that appear to be psychic <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a>, etc. But basically, ==whatever appears to me, I can relate to as a [[phenomenon]] and investigate it==, and investigate what kinds of [[relationships]], and how it works, how [[relationships]] function around that thing, whether it's an [[image]] or a worldly [[perception]] or whatever, of the different senses, etc., or an idea. All that is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a> - an idea, even, is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a> - and it's worthy of investigation. Of course, there are differences between those domains, kinds of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a>, but still. I'll just put this in now; it's something we'll come back to. What I think is ==if we go deeply enough and radically enough with this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a> approach, actually there are ways that it can end up opening what we might call <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metaphysics" data-href="Metaphysics" class="internal-link">metaphysical</a> philosophy.== But we'll come back to that. So first one's the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a> approach.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(2)** The second one, and we've talked about this before: **[[ways of looking]].** For me, this is another really fundamental, really powerful and pervasive concept, by which I mean not just looking with the eyes, certainly, but ways of sensing, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of knowing</a>, ways of perceiving. So it involves any senses. But really it refers to what is the perspective that's being employed now, and included in that is the relationship with the object that I'm perceiving, whatever that is (internal, external, etc.). Am I, for example, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a> at it? Am I pushing it away? Am I seeing it as self or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a>, etc.? All these are different [[ways of looking]]. Wrapped up in that, always in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a> is the <a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a>. ==So the whole kind of mishmash of conditioning factors in the perceiving makes the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a>. And there's _always_ a way of looking.== Most of the time, unless you're really into this way of practising (and even then), the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a> is not conscious. We're not actually conscious of everything that's involved in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a>, and most human beings have very little range or leeway in the [[ways of looking]]. In other words, they can just kind of, on a very gross level, shift the [[ways of looking]] a little bit. I would see <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a> practice as the practice of a whole range of [[ways of looking]], really developing that flexibility and that range of [[ways of looking]] in practice, in ways that really have a powerful effect. So that's number two, [[ways of looking]].</span>

<span class="paragraph">What is empty? Everything is empty, without question. So not just all selves and all things - and that means _any_ notion of self, so even [[the self]] as process, not a real thing. It's just arising as a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a>. It's a relative degree of [[fabrication]]. But [[awareness]] is empty too. Actually, even the notion of [[fabrication]] is empty too. In other words, it's not really real. It's a kind of construct that we see - there's actually a way of going deeper and deeper into the whole teaching of [[fabrication]] as a practice, and you find out that [[fabrication]], too, is kind of incoherent. It cannot be a reality. [[Dependent origination]], similarly, is empty - all those <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">twelve links</a>, or thirteen, or ten, or whatever system you're using. All of them are lacking inherent existence. They don't refer to real units of existence or units of being or realities or entities or whatever. The <a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a> actually also turns out to be empty, and the whole distinction then between what's [[unfabricated]] and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a>, also illusory. <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a>, as well, is also empty. So [[emptiness]] is a very radical, pervasive concept. Everything, without question, is empty. What we end up with then - ==we start with this notion of [[ways of looking]], and we end up with this really radical, thorough [[insight]] that in the end there are only [[ways of looking]]. The [[ways of looking]] are empty, too, but all we have is a range of [[ways of looking]], which we can expand. And those are not realities; those are [[ways of looking]]. Those [[ways of looking]] also don't inherently exist. But all we have, all we come to, the [[freedom]] that we come to, is there are just ways of looking.== Something very beautiful, very radical, very profound in that [[insight]], and extremely far-reaching.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So in a traditional <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> approach, as I said, the idea of [[ways of looking]], we channel that into the direction of: which are the [[ways of looking]] that bring more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, or lock <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> into place or whatever, and which are the [[ways of looking]] that ease <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>? The whole concept of [[ways of looking]], in the sort of narrow <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> sense, is tied up very much with the <a data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Four Noble Truths</a>, with what leads to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> and what leads to the ease of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. But in exploring [[ways of looking]], we also see that there are other directions that don't have - or at least don't _obviously_ have - much to do with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">end of suffering</a> that can open up. So a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a> can open up, for example, [[soulmaking]] more or less, or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a> more or less. They _are_ related to [[freedom]] and ending <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, reducing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, but sometimes not in a very obvious way.

<span class="paragraph">**(5)** The fifth, the words **[[imaginal]]** and **[[image]]**.

It can involve any of the senses, and quite unusual <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of knowing</a> and ways of perceiving things.

It may not be [[imaginal]]. ==An [[image]] is an [[image]] for me, or imaginally functioning for me, it's [[imaginal]] for me, if, for me, at that time, it has a kind of [[unfathomability]] to it==, a depth to it, just, for example, in the way that a person does. We would never, hopefully, say, "This person, my friend X, she means this to me," or "She _is_ this." I mean, we might say that, but we always know that that never captures her entirely. There's something I can't get to the bottom of her. Why? Because she's a person. She's a person. There's something unfathomable there. I can't reduce her. If I do start reducing her, what's going to happen to my relationship with her? She's probably not going to stick around much.</span>

##### Seeing the image as an image

<span class="paragraph">Now, I'm going to throw in one more thing here in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a>, which is that it involves also what I call seeing the [[image]] as an [[image]], knowing it's an [[image]]. In other words, we're not taking this literally. If I have an [[image]] of - well, certainly if I have an [[image]] of having sex with someone, it doesn't mean I have to have sex with someone, or I'm going to have sex with them. It doesn't mean that at all. I don't have to take it literally. ==But actually _any_ [[image]], it might have an outflow into life, but often that outflow is - it's almost always _not_ literal; it's always subtly kind of refracted or modulated in life in the way that it's expressed.== Seeing [[image]] as [[image]]. It doesn't mean, if I have this [[image]], that I'm picking up some kind of ESP, either, or whatever (although, of course, there's that possibility too). I'm not going to go into that distinction on this course. Seeing [[image]] as [[image]] also means that the ideas and the concepts that are perhaps wrapped up with the [[image]] are not taken as truth claims. I'm not saying, "This is the reality," or "This is true" about whatever. Okay, so that was the fifth one, [[image]] and [[imaginal]].</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(6)** The sixth one, very related, is **[[soulmaking]]**, which I used already. ==What's [[soulmaking]]? It's anything, any activity or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a> or way of being, that gives rise to a sense of soulfulness.== So we could use it in the way of meaning it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a>-making; it's making the [[experience]] of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a>. And again, it could be anything. It could be anything, in relationship with anything at all. The way of being with it, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a> at it, the thing that I do with it or in relationship to it, gives rise to a sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a>. Again, this is very related to the definitions of '[[imaginal]],' but ==when there is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a>, there is a sense of importance, of deep importance. This thing is important to me.== Strange as it might seem to someone else, this is important to me. It has a deep importance. It has a [[beauty]] to it.</span>

<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > ^8-2" data-href="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#^8-2" class="internal-link">8-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (3) · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> (7) · <a data-href="Meaningfulness" class="internal-link">Meaningfulness</a> · <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a> (5) · <a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> (5) · <a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a> · <a data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">Dimensionality</a> · <a data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">Fantasy</a> · <a data-href="Logos" class="internal-link">Logos</a> · <a data-href="Gestalt psychology" class="internal-link">Gestalt psychology</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">There is [[love]] involved, and often very different kinds of [[love]], a large range in the kind of expressions of [[love]] that are involved in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a>. <a data-href="Meaningfulness" class="internal-link">Meaningfulness</a>, resonances. So [[soulmaking]] is recognized through its resonances in the heart, in the emotionality, its resonances in terms of [[image]]. An [[image]] has resonance with other [[image]], and an [[image]] itself is resonant with the [[energy body]] (which I'll come to in a little bit) and with ideas. <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a> also gives a sense of [[dimensionality]]. It involves [[image]] and [[fantasy]], and also idea, what we're going to call '[[logos]]'; all of that. So [[soulmaking]] means <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a>-making, in the sense it makes that kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Gestalt psychology" data-href="Gestalt psychology" class="internal-link">gestalt</a>. The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Gestalt psychology" data-href="Gestalt psychology" class="internal-link">gestalt</a> of those kinds of experiences refers to a sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a>. ==But [[soulmaking]] can also mean making [[soul]], making something called [[soul]]. So not just <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a> as an adjective to describe a set of experiences, but also making something called soul.== Okay. So the sixth term here is '[[soulmaking]].'</span>

##### (7) Soul - either a way of looking which gives rise to soulmaking, or an entity
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > ^8-3" data-href="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#^8-3" class="internal-link">8-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> (15) · <a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a> (3) · <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a> (6) · <a data-href="Citta" class="internal-link">Citta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> · <a data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">Fantasy</a> · <a data-href="Meaningfulness" class="internal-link">Meaningfulness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">Dimensionality</a> · <a data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">Beauty</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(7)** The seventh term is indeed that word, **[[soul]]**. What does this mean? Here, again, I can use it in two ways. I can use '[[soul]]' not in the sense of referring to an entity, but referring to a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a>: [[soul]] is just a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a> that gives rise to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a>, that gives rise to [[soulmaking]]. When I say '[[soul]],' I'm just referring to it as a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a>. But I can also refer to [[soul]] as if it were an entity. We'll talk about it as an entity, an _empty_ entity, going back to what we said earlier about self. We talk about self as if it's an entity, but it's not. It's empty, yet we still use the concept, and we feel it as an entity, etc., at times. Similarly, we can talk about [[soul]] as if it was an entity. ==What kind of entity? Well, it's that entity, that aspect of _[[citta]]_, if you like, that facet of _[[citta]]_ or being, that which sees or senses in a [[soulmaking]] way. That's the entity of soul.== It's that which sees in a [[soulmaking]] way, in what I meant in all that before - with [[image]], with [[fantasy]], with [[meaningfulness]], with depth, with [[dimensionality]] and [[beauty]] and all that. That's [[soul]]. So [[soulmaking]] increases [[soul]], it makes [[soul]], in the sense that it reinforces, it strengthens, it widens and deepens that entity or that capacity or that tendency to see in a [[soulmaking]] way, to see in a way that gives rise to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a>, to see imaginally, and with [[meaningfulness]] and resonance, and depth and [[beauty]], and all that. ==<a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a> _builds_ [[soul]]. It _makes_ soul.== Okay, so that's the seventh, the term '[[soul]].'</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(8)** The eighth is the term **[[energy body]]**. It can sound like we're talking about some _thing_, some kind of New Age idea or esoteric idea. Really ==I'm referring to a mode of attending to the [[experience]] of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> - a way of looking==, again, if we go back to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a> approach. The [[energy body]] really refers to that: a way of attending to this space, actually a little bit bigger than what appears to be my <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a>, and the feeling of that, the sense of that; yes, the [[image]] of it, but also ==the palpable sense of that field of vibration, texture, [[energy]], etc.== Really important to stress here: there is a real spectrum, there's a wide spectrum, in that [[experience]], so that we can [[experience]] a very, very refined field of [[energy]], very insubstantial, ethereal, and that's lovely and actually very important. Sometimes even _that_ goes, and there's just a sense of space, which is really at the edge of what we might call <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body experience</a>.</span>

##### The energy body refers to the whole spectrum of sensitivity

<span class="paragraph">But at the other end, there's also just the sense of something really dense and earthy and solid and very substantial. We can feel the [[energy body]] there. So the [[energy body]] refers to that whole spectrum. And it means more than just what many people are familiar with from, say, [[mindfulness]] practice or more conventional kinds of or more common ways of teaching <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a> practice - what can seem at times just like this pulsing or flickering field of sensations, or field of hot or cold or pressure, etc. Yes, that's a certain kind of, let's say, mode of [[attention]] or feeling of [[experience]] of the [[energy body]], but it actually is much broader than that. There are ways of paying [[attention]] and experiences of [[energy body]] that are not like either that or the regular sort of solidity we feel. There's really a whole range there. That's [[energy body]]. That's the eighth.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(9)** The ninth is **[[eros]]**, which we've already defined in a small way, and we're going to expand it and kind of make a bigger definition as we go along. So it's the [[desire]] - [[eros]] is a kind of [[desire]]. ==It's the wanting more contact, more connection, more touching, more [[experience]] of or to [[experience]] more of, to know more or to know more of, to penetrate more or to penetrate more of, or to open more and to open to more of==, to have more intimacy with some object, some erotic object (either in everyday [[perception]] or in [[imaginal]], intrapsychically). Note that this is multidimensional, multifaceted. We're not just talking about a mental faculty here - I'll come back to this, but ==some kind of _vitakka-vicāra_ thing where you're just probing the object==. I'll come back to that relationship. First of all, it's not just mental. ==It involves all the senses. And it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">embodied</a>, which doesn't mean that it needs to manifest in action.== More importantly, and this is where the definition starts to get bigger, it involves and it pulls in and stimulates the [[imaginal]] and the ideational. So actually when we talk about [[eros]], we're talking about something that includes the [[imaginal]] and the ideational in certain ways, in ways that expand them and moves towards [[soulmaking]]. So [[eros]] is the ninth term.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(10)** And you can see [[eros]] is one kind of [[desire]], if we use that word, **[[desire]]**, as the tenth term. And [[desire]], we can maybe use it in a way that's more neutral, or as a more broad term, perhaps similar to the Pali word _[[chanda]]_. So [[desire]] would then include [[eros]] as a subset in the way that we've just described. When it does that, when the [[desire]] is of that kind, it's [[eros]]. But [[desire]] would also include [[craving]] and [[clinging]] and these kind of words we've used before, which I'll come to in a minute. But the tenth is just [[desire]] as kind of a broad term of which there are different kinds, and it's kind of a neutral term.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(11)** That word, **[[craving]]**, is the eleventh. We'll come back to this more. I'm going to say ==[[craving]] is a kind of [[desire]] that does _not_ lead to [[soulmaking]]. Actually, it leads to a kind of [[contraction]]. <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a> is an opening movement, and [[craving]] brings contraction.== As I said, you can actually feel that in the being, in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, in the [[energy body]], in the [[mind]], and in lots of other ways, which we'll go into. <a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a> brings _[[dukkha]],_ in the way that _we_ might use it, okay? So to distinguish [[eros]] and [[craving]], different kinds of [[desire]]. But [[craving]] is the eleventh term.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(12)** Maybe if I use the term **[[clinging]]** as the twelfth term, what I'm really referring to is that whole spectrum that I talked about in the first few talks, where you're really talking about something that can be very, very gross, gripping, like, "Don't leave me! I need you!", that kind of [[clinging]], to something really, really subtle, talking about actually _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a>_, just the belief, the unconscious assumption, that this thing (whatever this thing is, this emotion, this fingernail, this foot) is me or mine, unconsciously, without even thinking about it, or even the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a>_ that this thing (whatever this thing is, this moment of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a>_ or this lamp in front of me) has inherent existence. That _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a>_ is a very subtle level of [[clinging]]. It's wrapped up in [[attention]], because the [[mind]] needs to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a> in a very subtle way to actually perceive anything. But ==[[clinging]], we might use it to refer to that whole spectrum in that broader sense.== Okay, so that's the twelfth term, [[clinging]].</span>

<span class="paragraph">In a way, it refers to psychic [[energy]], and the way that can be employed in different ways. I think that's equivalent to how <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Carl Gustav Jung" data-href="Carl Gustav Jung" class="internal-link">Jung</a> used the term, but I also read something recently where he sort of said that, and then said something else: "But I don't mean it like that." But he didn't really explain the alternative, and I couldn't find anything else, so I'm not sure how he uses it. But it is a term that people use. For <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sigmund Freud" data-href="Sigmund Freud" class="internal-link">Freud</a>, I think it was just the pleasure principle, in a way, or the instinct that came out of the id, the sort of pool of animalistic instincts, if you like, and the force, often guided by the pleasure principle and maybe other things, and that's the libido. Sometimes <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sigmund Freud" data-href="Sigmund Freud" class="internal-link">Freud</a> referred to it that way. For other people, it literally means sexual urge or [[desire]]. And there's also, some of you will know (I'm going to return to this) a psychoanalyst - I think he was very active in the fifties and sixties, possibly - Scottish, called <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ronald Fairbairn" data-href="Ronald Fairbairn" class="internal-link">Fairbairn</a>. He used libido in a way that sounds, at first, similar to the way we're using [[eros]]: a [[desire]] to connect. It sounds similar, but actually I'm going to point out some differences later on in the [[retreat]]. So libido, people use it in very different ways. Sorry I've already been sloppy and inconsistent there. All I can say is maybe the sloppiness and fluidity in the way I'm using it just reflects its etymology, which I've already said: libido, libation, liquid. This is the etymology. It's liquidy. So I'm quite fluid in my definitions. That's a pretty lame excuse! But I don't think we'll be using it much anyway. Anyway, apologies. That's the thirteenth term.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(14)** The fourteenth term is **[[psyche]]**. One meaning of [[psyche]], in the way that I use it, is just really the totality of the _[[citta]]_, the [[psyche]]. In other words, the [[mind]], but not reduced to the thinking [[mind]]; just the whole totality of _[[citta]]_. But another kind of inflection of the meaning means especially '[[soul]],' so using it equivalently with '[[soul]],' in the way that I defined '[[soul]]' earlier in this talk, as the sort of organ of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal perception</a>. So [[psyche]] as the organ of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal perception</a>. But there's a second way that I use it sometimes, and by '[[psyche]]' I mean the totality of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal perceptions</a>. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Carl Gustav Jung" data-href="Carl Gustav Jung" class="internal-link">Jung</a> actually says [[psyche]] _is_ [[image]]. I'm using it sometimes as the totality of the _[[citta]];_ more often as the equivalent with [[soul]], the organ of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal perception</a>; but quite a few times I will use it as the totality of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal perceptions</a>, so it's almost interchangeable with '[[image]].'</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(15)** **<a data-href="Logos" class="internal-link">Logos</a>**.

For example, when I say 'the autonomy of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a>,' as if they have a degree of being independent of me, that's a concept.

<span class="paragraph">Any idea of causality (that _this_ is a result of _that_ in the past, for instance) is also a [[logos]], a concept operating.

You're learning a lot of Greek on this [[retreat]]! ==<a data-href="Telos" class="internal-link">Telos</a> refers to almost like causality from the future.== I've talked about this, I think, on the last [[retreat]].^[E.g.

<span class="paragraph">So what I want to say is that there's always a conception, there's always a [[logos]] operating in the [[mind]] - always, always, always, except during an [[experience]] of the <a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a>, when there's a collapse of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptuality</a>.

We _live_ a [[logos]], or we live logoi. We live different ideas. Different concepts shape how we live, they inform how we live, but more fundamentally, they shape our way of looking.== They're part of, they're included in, the way we look at everything, and therefore what we perceive, what appears to us. So they have massive influence. I'm not talking about abstract ideas here. So the fifteenth is [[logos]].</span>

It's a [[perception]] of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmos</a>, it's a mystical [[perception]], but it's characterized by universality: all things in the world are of the same substance, and the substance is [[love]]. It could be [[awareness]]. If you practice a lot with a vastness of [[awareness]] and other related practices, you get a similar thing. The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a> there is also universal: everything is [[awareness]], everything is the play of [[awareness]], etc.</span>

<span class="paragraph">We're participating in something. The way of looking, the _citta_, the soul, is participating in the cosmos. So there's a participatory aspect of a kind of cosmopoesis, of the reality-creating. And also, cosmopoesis - we're talking about poetic truths, if you like, here, which is something I've talked about before, which is different than the usual notion of scientific truth. This, also, I've talked about before; there's a whole - you know, really going into the philosophy of science and what's true and what's a model, etc., and all that. And also to point out that when I use the words - I was contrasting _poiesis_ and _logos_, but actually when I use the word 'logos' in the way _we're_ using it, we're not making a truth claim, other than that everything is empty, and even _that_, actually, you let go of at a certain point. A logos is just a concept that we can pick up, or a Conceptual framework we can pick up, without insisting or even believing it as true. Okay? But cosmopoesis is the seventeenth one.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Just to say a little bit about that word. You know, standard <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a> will bring experiences of [[divinity]] of certain kinds - a whole range, actually. Various experiences of [[divinity]], mystical experiences, I would say would be inevitable for meditators meditating with dedication and consistently with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a> techniques and approaches, etc. For example, that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awareness" data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">big awareness</a> thing, everything is [[awareness]], or everything is [[love]] - it really _feels_ like there is a [[divinity]] to that [[love]]. The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmos</a> is shot through with a divine [[love]]. This [[awareness]] has somehow the sense [of [[divinity]]]. People often talk, though they never have before, they start talking in theistic terms, almost surprising to themselves, when those kinds of very common experiences happen. I would say certain kinds of practices, I can put people in a room, get them to do these practices, and it's just a matter of time until these very standard experiences of [[divinity]] open up, and people almost inevitably start using that language.</span>

##### Sometimes is useful to let go of experiences of divinity, but mostly it's not that helpful
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > ^13-5" data-href="0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#^13-5" class="internal-link">13-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So the question is, if these experiences open up, even in standard <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a>, what is the attitude to these experiences? What's the relationship to them? How are we interpreting them? How are we conceptualizing them? A person might be told, or might hear, or might think, "Well, all experiences are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a>. Don't think about them. Don't get attached to them. Don't try and repeat them." We touched on this earlier. That's useful sometimes. _Sometimes_ that's useful, to let go when it's too tight, the kind of gripping, the attachment. But mostly it's not that helpful as a kind of attitude or a way of relating to these kind of experiences. It's not quite intelligent enough. It won't open things out in a way that is that beneficial.</span>

He did not say in relation to them, "Oh, just don't try and repeat them. Let's not go there. Don't get attached," etc. He gave them names.

And as the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Buddhadharma</a> evolved after the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> died, in different streams of the tradition - the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a> and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vajrayana" data-href="Vajrayana" class="internal-link">Vajrayāna</a> - there was an even greater exploration and a range of [[experience]] that was opening up from people's meditative practice, and an even more careful and comprehensive and manifold sort of categorization of those range of experiences involving different senses of [[divinity]].</span>

<span class="paragraph">So when we say '[[divinity]],' I'm leaving it quite broad, but really talking about a whole range of experiences there. Again, some may be universal in character and impersonal in character, and some may be very particular, and some are related to particularities and theophanies, etc., and some will be personal, a personal god, an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a> as a personal god and not an impersonal deity.

<span class="paragraph">**(20)** And the last one that I may use is **<a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a>**. In the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddhism" data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhist tradition</a>, this is a term that has a wide range of usage and arguments and all kinds of stuff. Some traditions use it in quite a narrow way: it just actually is your capacity to become fully <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightened</a>, to become a <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>, usually over many lifetimes, just by virtue of the fact that the [[mind]], and the factors of the [[mind]], and the contents of the [[mind]] are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a>.

<span class="paragraph">In some meanings of the word <a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a>, it just refers to that. It's just your kind of unavoidable, no matter what you think of yourself, or where you are actually at in terms of your (quote) 'spiritual development,' ==there is always and undestroyably the possibility of becoming a Buddha.== That's one usage. Sometimes, in more popular usage nowadays, it just kind of refers to your innate goodness. So if you think you're a mean person, and you see lots of not-so-nice stuff, then it's just a kind of way of saying that in you, at your core, is something bright and luminous and good, inherently good, inherently loving. If I use the term, I probably use it as just an alternative to the word God, in fact, or [[divinity]], which I'm using in a much more broad way, just because oftentimes the words God or [[divinity]] really rub people the wrong way, and especially some Buddhists. So we can use it, <a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a>, but in a different way than just that possibility. I'm actually talking about something that's divine. And again, it has a range of meanings.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Perhaps the most sort of full-on meaning, if you like, is from the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Shentong" data-href="Shentong" class="internal-link">Shentong tradition</a> in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tibetan Buddhism" data-href="Tibetan Buddhism" class="internal-link">Tibetan tradition</a>. Actually, it's a tradition that goes back to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a> Indian <a data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhism</a>. In that tradition, <a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a> is interchangeable with words like _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharmakaya" data-href="Dharmakaya" class="internal-link">dharmakāya</a>_, and actually even the word [[emptiness]], which is used differently when they use it in that tradition from the way I'm using it. So ==<a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a>, _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharmakaya" data-href="Dharmakaya" class="internal-link">dharmakāya</a>_, [[emptiness]], the Absolute, and other words (there are quite a few words that are used interchangeably), means something like the cosmic [[awareness]] that is inherently in me and in you and in everything, that knows the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of all things</a>, is not separate (as separating subjects and objects). In that sense, it's non-dual. It refers, then, to the knowing - which is also empty; this knowing [[awareness]] is empty in itself - but the knowing and_ the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a> _and_ their emptiness.== All that, known in a kind of non-dual way. In other words, it includes the whole <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmos</a> as this kind of field of empty [[awareness]] knowing all things and also the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of all things</a>. So everything is <a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a>, everything has <a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a>, everything _is_ <a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a>, everything is _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharmakaya" data-href="Dharmakaya" class="internal-link">dharmakāya</a>_ in that [[logos]], in that [[experience]].</span>

##### The dharmakaya can act in the world

<span class="paragraph">Also, even stranger - to some Buddhists, this will sound strange - is that this _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharmakaya" data-href="Dharmakaya" class="internal-link">dharmakāya</a>_ or this <a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a> can act. So this cosmic <a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a> can act in the world and manifest different <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a> or different qualities for an individual, or in an individual, dependent on what that individual needs for their <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a> and their deeper journey, so that there's a kind of, if you like, intelligence - something akin to the ==World <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> - there's a kind of intelligence or divine activity that's operating in and through and as <a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a>, as well as that [[awareness]] and its inseparability from [[emptiness]], from <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a>, etc.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">Phew. Okay. So there are twenty terms in a kind of glossary.</span>
