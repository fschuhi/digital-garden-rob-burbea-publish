##### Nobody has a problem with a "Dharma" which mixes in established Western ideas from science or psychotherapy
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4 > ^1-1" data-href="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#^1-1" class="internal-link">1-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> (6) · <a data-href="Neuroscience" class="internal-link">Neuroscience</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40166/20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=00:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Now, I'm aware that these - well, many of these, at least - are quite unfamiliar ideas for many people, maybe even many <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> people, and maybe in the culture. So I want to just say something about that. It's a lot easier to teach <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, or rather there's no _objection_, which makes it easier when we teach <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> or present something as <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, in the cases where we mix in all kinds of assumptions, or frames of reference, or conceptual bases, or conceptual biases as well, as long as they're well-established in Western modernist culture and assumed to be true by that culture. So when you mix those kind of ideas in and assumptions in, and package it all as (quote) '<a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>' - for instance, <a data-href="neuroscience" class="internal-link">neuroscience</a> or some of the ideas from modern psychotherapy - and you introduce them, and they become absorbed or blended into (quote) '<a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>,' that's a lot easier. Rarely does anyone's eyebrows get raised or anyone have a problem with that.</span>

##### Unpopular or especially foreign ideas are much conspicuous as an addition
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4 > ^1-2" data-href="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> · <a data-href="Neuroscience" class="internal-link">Neuroscience</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40166/20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=01:43" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">When one tries to introduce or open up more unfamiliar ideas, ideas that are not popular or populist in the culture, that's more difficult. And more than that, when one, if you like, adds something, so to speak, 'foreign' or new to what we might call '<a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>,' when it's foreign or new, that addition is much more conspicuous as an addition than when they're sort of ideas that people are familiar with from their culture. It's still happening; it's still an addition. There is still an addition, even when it's not obvious when we add ideas about <a data-href="neuroscience" class="internal-link">neuroscience</a>, or modern psychotherapy ideas, or whatever. It's still happening, nevertheless. Something is being added. It's just not so _obvious_.</span>

##### Operating without truth claims is difficult for people to wrap their head around
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4 > ^1-3" data-href="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> · <a data-href="Neuroscience" class="internal-link">Neuroscience</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40166/20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=02:52" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Add to that this other idea, that the ideas we are using are not truth claims, they don't refer to realities, and _that_ is very difficult sometimes for people to get their heads around, as well, because we're used to hearing, "It's like this," or "It's like that," or thinking that <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> concepts refer to realities, etc. Certainly when we think about <a data-href="neuroscience" class="internal-link">neuroscience</a> or modern psychotherapy ideas, almost always, almost without exception, there's the assumption and the message that these are realities. So it's quite difficult sometimes to hear something or to try and present something as, "These ideas don't have truth claims in the way that we usually operate with truth claims and truth assumptions."</span>

##### In any Dharma, fantasy and image is already involved
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4 > ^1-4" data-href="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> (4) · <a data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">Fantasy</a> (3) · <a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> (3) · <a data-href="Meaningfulness" class="internal-link">Meaningfulness</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40166/20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=03:50" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So, unfamiliar. I'm aware of that, and I'm certainly aware of the difficulties in trying to present all this. But still, I insist, absolutely insist, that in our <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> - in other words, in _your_ <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, in _your_ practice, and in _your_ life - <a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a> and <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a> is already involved. It's already involved in <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, in practice, and life. I absolutely insist on that. ==And I also insist that this is not a bad thing. Not at all a bad thing. It's inevitable, and it's important, and it may well, I would say, be necessary. It's certainly necessary to galvanize in relation to practice and <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, and to be inspired in life, and to have meaningfulness.== All that's necessary. So it's not a bad thing. ==We need to recognize both the general fact that it's operating, and also the particular ways that it's operating for us, that <a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a> and <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a> operate for us, and the kinds and directions in which <a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a> and <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a> operate, and mix in with our life, and impel our life.== We need a double level of recognition: general, and a more individual, particular.</span>

##### We need to include ideas such as soulmaking or eros
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4 > ^1-5" data-href="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#^1-5" class="internal-link">1-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">Papanca</a> · <a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a> · <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a> · <a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40166/20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=05:16" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Out of that, we need to kind of expand a psychology that can talk about that and include all that, recognize it and be sensitive to it and be wise in relationship to it, instead of just not admitting it, not seeing it, or trying to cut it because it's _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a>_. We need to include, then, in this psychology, in this <a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a>, we need to include ideas such as <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a> or <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a> that are not yet articulated in what we call '<a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>.' To me, that seems a necessity, you know, something that's called for. When we look at our life and the movements of our life with a psychology that's too simplistic, it doesn't serve us. It doesn't serve the totality of our being.</span>

##### "It's just vedana, papanca" is a little bit poor as a psychology
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4 > ^2-1" data-href="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">Vedana</a> (4) · <a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> · <a data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">Papanca</a> · <a data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">Imaginal</a> · <a data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">Fantasy</a> · <a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> · <a data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">Habit</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">Delineations</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40166/20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=06:16" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">A person says, "Well, that's just _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a>_ leading." So when you talk about <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a> or that kind of thing, "That's just _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a>_ leading. You're just chasing the pleasant or running away from the unpleasant," or "That's just _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a>_," when we talk about the <a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a> or <a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a>; what motivates us is either this movement governed by _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a>_ towards pleasant and unpleasant, or some people teach that basically we get attached to things like views because we're trying to shore up this self that somehow, deep down, we know is not real - therefore we attach, we <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a> to this and this, to try and shore up my views and my <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a> and all that. But that kind of psychology, this self shoring up, or the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a>_ leading, that _that's_ what's going on, or it's just _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ - I've touched on this before - this is, in a way, not sophisticated enough. ==It's a little bit poor as a psychology. Valuable as it is (we've talked about this), we need something richer, deeper, wider: a psychology that can accommodate and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">delineate</a> between the kinds of things that we're talking about.==</span>

##### Craving is not soulmaking
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4 > ^2-2" data-href="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">Imaginal</a> · <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a> · <a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a> · <a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> · <a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a> · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40166/20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=07:39" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">From our perspective, the movement to seek to increase pleasure or decrease unpleasant sensations, when that is the prime intention of a movement of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> or <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, when that's the prime driver, to maximize or increase pleasant sensations and decrease unpleasant ones, when that's the prime driver, and there isn't this richness of what we call <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal perception</a>, then that is axiomatically (in the way that _we're_ talking about it) not <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a>. That's not creating <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a>. It will not do that. It's not <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a>. It's what we might call <a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a>, as I said. But to think too much that way, or to really regard as if that's the thing that mostly moves us as human beings, it's a really, really poor psychology. But it's interesting. This kind of need to expand the psychology a little bit and enrich the psychology a little bit, it's not just in the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> transmission, in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma circles</a>. It's in the wider culture too.</span>

##### Story: oncologist, "quality of life"
<span class="counts"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4 > ^2-3" data-href="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a></span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40166/20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=09:02" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">I had an oncologist until recently, and he prescribed me the standard course of chemotherapy for my condition, but I think he basically thought it wouldn't work, because of the disease I had, and the stage it was at and all that. It wouldn't work, so there was no point trying to do any more chemotherapy. Plus, it was also potentially dangerous, and it wasn't a risk that he was prepared to take for different reasons - that it might do more harm than good, I think is what he thought. But in trying to persuade me to sort of give up wanting to experiment a little bit with longer and more chemotherapy, etc., he would often say something like, "It's about quality of life. Come off the chemo, and just enjoy the duration of the rest of your life with a better quality of life."</span>

##### "Go on holiday" - but why not on pilgrimage?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4 > ^2-4" data-href="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#^2-4" class="internal-link">2-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40166/20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=10:03" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">He would often say this, and I often had the feeling that he and I understood very different things about what constituted a good quality of life. But then he would also often say "quality of life," and then say a bit more, and often he would say, "go on holiday." He would often say that as part of his sort of package of what 'quality of life' meant, and what I could do if I was off chemo, as I could go on holiday. That is probably partly reflecting just - as an NHS oncologist, he was probably grossly overworked and overstretched, and probably was desperately needing a break and <a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a> a holiday. But he didn't say, "Quality of life, so you can go on pilgrimage." A medieval peasant in Christendom, or Tibetan Buddhists even nowadays, or a Muslim nowadays, if they were told, "You probably only have some months to live," one of the responses might be, from the doctor saying that, "You know, take the time off the medication. You might be able to make a pilgrimage."</span>

##### Cultures tend to assume a universality of wants
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4 > ^3-1" data-href="0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#^3-1" class="internal-link">3-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a> · <a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a> (3) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a> · <a data-href="History" class="internal-link">History</a> · <a data-href="Modernism" class="internal-link">Modernism</a> · <a data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">Dominant culture</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/40166/20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=11:22" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Very different mindset. What's the difference? Well, one typically - I mean, this isn't black and white, but - one <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a> or seeks a reduction in stress, an increase in pleasure, perhaps seeking out novel or exciting experiences, whereas the pilgrimage, in contrast to holiday, pilgrimage is a movement of <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a>, an actual movement that is <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a>; an <a data-href="embodiment" class="internal-link">embodiment</a> of <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a>, s omething we do with our bodies that is an erotic movement that brings <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a>. It's interesting. Different cultures, ancient and contemporary, religious and secular, tend to assume a universality of wants - that people want this or that, or most people want this. In the modern secular West, the choice we have of what we seek is actually wider, and perhaps wider than at any point in the whole <a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a> of humanity. That's one of the things that actually characterizes <a data-href="modernism" class="internal-link">modernism</a> - well, secularity, particularly, and also consumerism. So the choice is wider. And also individuality has a certain premium in modern secular <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">Western culture</a>, so it's acknowledged that the individual, the person, has a choice that needs to be respected, to a certain extent, in what's important to them. But still, there's usually a presumption that most people will conform to what's, we could say, popular, secular values, and that what you'll want is a holiday, as opposed to something like a pilgrimage.</span>

<span class="paragraph">With all this, and all this talk about <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a> and exploration of <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a>, I really want to emphasize again something you've heard in relation to the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> before, I'm sure. Don't _believe_; these teachings, the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> said, are _ehipassiko, to be _seen_. _Ehipassiko_ means 'to come and see,' for one to come and see, for oneself, through practice. Find out. It's not a matter of belief. Find out, regarding to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma teachings</a>. You've heard that before, I'm sure, if you've been practising for a while. For a lot of people, that's the attraction of the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> over, say, other religions, that message. But what often happens for practitioners is we see something a few times - for example, that <a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a> leads to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> - and we hear these teachings about <a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a>, etc., and something generalizes quite quickly, because it's a message we get a lot, and we actually stop questioning. We stop the breadth and the depth and the radicality of our questioning. We stop looking further.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And so, in a way, we kind of program our <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a>, and we only see _this_. So I've asked sometimes a crowd, an audience, "Are you sure that <a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a> leads to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>?" And people just nod, "Yeah, absolutely, I'm sure, because I've checked it out and everything." And it _doesn't_ always lead to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, as I showed in the "<a data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">Beauty</a> of <a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a>" talks.^[Rob Burbea, "The Beauty of Desire" [Parts 1 and 2] (19 and 26 Nov. 2011), [https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=beauty+of+desire](https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=beauty+of+desire)] But there can be this belief that we're finding out for ourself, not believing anything, but actually something gets a little stuck, and we stop the _ehipassiko_. We stop the movement to come find out, to look further, to keep exploring. What I want to say with all this, ==I really want to ask and encourage open-mindedness, exploration, practice, that kind of boldness and experimentation, and playing, and willingness to investigate, to question.==</span>

This is to be noticed in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a>. And it's both ways.

Oftentimes it's very sexual, not even just erotic; it's actually really sexual. And very different kinds of <a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a>. Some are very sort of soft and loving, and others darker versions or stronger versions, if you like. It may or may not even be your usual gender or sexual orientation, all that that you're used to identifying with.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Last thing for now. I can't remember now if I've said it, but it may be dawning on you that - I did say it, didn't I? - that there's a small definition of <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a>, as we said, that <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a> is this wanting more contact, connection, intimacy, <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, knowing, penetration, opening to of the erotic other, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">erotic-imaginal object</a>, of something, and that's what we're <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a> the small definition. There's also, because of the way that <a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a>, and <a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a>, and <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, and the <a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a>, and <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a>, and that whole <a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking dynamic" data-href="Soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">eros-psyche-logos dynamic</a>, are actually implicated, or the natural tendency of what <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a> does - it _will_ start to involve them, and it _will_ start to expand, unless it's inhibited. We can also kind of talk about <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a> and imply all that, really imply that whole dynamic, that whole constellation, so that in the small definition we're really talking about <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a> as one element of that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking dynamic" data-href="Soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">eros-psyche-logos</a>, that <a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a>.

<span class="paragraph">This is just one of those things. Again, I probably apologize in advance: I predict that I'll be going back and forth between these two meanings, the more small meaning, and sort of saying something like, "When <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a> gets blocked it becomes <a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a>," or something like that, or "When the <a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a> doesn't expand enough, then there are problems." But it should probably be pretty clear in that. Another implication there is that <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a> in itself, so to speak - the small definition - is neither inherently, intrinsically positive or negative, good or bad. It's just this wanting, as I said, more contact, more opening, more penetration, more intimacy, more <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, more knowing of, all that, with the erotic object. So in itself, it's neither here nor there. Of course, there _is_ no 'in itself.' We can't extricate it as something that _doesn't_ stimulate this whole movement of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking dynamic" data-href="Soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">eros-psyche-logos</a>, this whole dynamic, interwoven dynamic, or as something that is trying to stimulate that dynamic but is blocked in different ways. So there really is no 'in itself.' ==Whether <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a> is fertilizing for the <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a>, is <a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a>, is enriching, is beautiful, is opening and opening up the sense of existence or not, and therefore desirable or not, is really dependent on what happens in relationship to that whole dynamic, or how that whole dynamic is able to unfold.== We'll talk a lot about this.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So in itself, it's neither. If there is an 'in itself,' <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a> is neither actually good or bad, positive or negative. It's just this thing. But oftentimes we'll be talking in the bigger definition, bigger implication. When a <a data-href="realism" class="internal-link">realism</a> comes in, and I really don't see this <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a> as an <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, I really take it as literal or a truth, or this idea that's wrapped up in the <a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a> and the erotic object, and I take that <a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a> as really being true, then problems come in, and <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a> becomes <a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a>. When there's <a data-href="realism" class="internal-link">realism</a>, <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a> leads to <a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a>, related to what I said before about the solidification, etc. We'll come back to this. There are other kind of problems that can come in. There can be a cramping, or a blocking, or a limiting in different ways, either of the <a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a>, of the libido, if you like, or of the <a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a>, of the <a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a> function, or of the <a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a>. So when any of these elements is cramped, blocked, limited, then it gives rise to problems in the relationship with the other, with the erotic object. We're going to look at this in much more detail as we go on.</span>
