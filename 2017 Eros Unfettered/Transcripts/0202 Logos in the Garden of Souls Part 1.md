Summary: [[Logos in the Garden of Souls Part 1]]

<br/>

###### 1-1
So let us continue in our circling motion, our circling movement, between the different elements and facets of this whole area that we are trying to open up of [[eros]] and [[soulmaking]], and continue our weave back and forth revisiting certain of those elements and weaving them together with others, back and forth like a loom. ^1-1
###### 1-2
And so I mentioned that I would like to say more about the whole aspect of [[conceptual framework]], and draw that in and draw that out more. So I hope it is obvious - it should be obvious, I think - that any path that we wish to walk down, a spiritual path, a psycho-spiritual path, whatever, and any set of practices that form part of that path, that path and those practices need some kind of undergirding in a conceptual framework, a [[logos]] that holds them together, that puts them in relationship to other to each other, makes sense of them, gives them direction - all that. So they go together. They are kind of indispensable, a conceptual framework is indispensable to a path. And as such it forms - in a way it forms a map or part of a map, you could say, of where that path is trying to go, if we use that [[image]]. It helps in the navigation, that is what we were talking about before, navigation. What is the art of navigation with all of these practices? ^1-2
###### 1-3
The [[conceptual framework]] is very much a part of that at a lot of different levels, you know. One level is a kind of macro. The other level is a kind of moment to moment - the conceptual framework, our [[Insight|understanding]] of that, informs our moment to moment decisions and responses in practice. In life we are constantly meeting, encountering, a new situation, a new moment with a new [[experience]], this or that coming to the fore, and the question is how should I respond? How should I navigate in relation to what is coming up, in relation to where I want to go? All of that is informed by the larger conceptual framework. Conceptual framework, [[logos]], also makes sense - we need something to make sense, or part of us needs something to make sense of our experiences, of the whole notion of [[Dharma|the path]], of our life, all of that. So conceptual framework is part of that. It offers that, it contributes to that. ^1-3
###### 1-4
Actually there is a whole other level in which it 'makes sense' in a different meaning of the word. It makes sense. In other words, it makes [[experience]]. We will come back to that. But it forms for us a [[vessel]], if we go back to that [[Alchemy|alchemical]] metaphor or maxim that we were drawing on. The [[conceptual framework]] forms a vessel, forms a structure that contains, we feel contained by, supported by, so that we can trust our movement on [[Dharma|the path]] (are we going in the right direction); we trust our experiences as they unfold, or we know what to trust. So in that sense it gives us a sense of stability, support and stability, and that is part of balance is not it? So we are talking about navigating and finding balance with [[eros]], with the [[imaginal]] etc.. So conceptual framework, [[logos]], is part of what grounds us. We say it is a head thing but actually it grounds us, it gives us a foundation, it gives us a kind of scaffolding. ^1-4
###### 1-5
Now especially if we are encountering intense experiences, but even if they are not intense, if we are just feeling ourselves move into what might be new territory or edgy territory, if it is our edge or it is regarded by the [[Dominant Culture|mainstream of society]] or whatever culture we are moving in, [[Dharma|dharma culture]] or other, you know, larger culture, regarded as edgy or dangerous or ridiculous or whatever it is. So really, really supportive there in all of that - grounding, foundation, scaffold, support, [[vessel]], all of that. And, you know, [[eros]] the [[imaginal]] and [[soulmaking]] for a lot of people is regarded as edgy and all that other stuff. So in a way we could, to give a sort of [[image]]/metaphor for a [[conceptual framework]], it is kind of like a trellis in a garden, you know, a sort of wooden scaffolding, if you like, or could be made of something else, that forms a support for a certain flower - maybe roses or something - to grow, and they grow along or up and wind their way along this trellis, and then they can flower and they can have their [[beauty]] and their beauty can be seen and we can receive that. The structure, the trellis is providing a structure that is supportive and for the sake of all the beauty that flowers there. ^1-5
###### 2-1
So oftentimes we do not really - sometimes we dismiss or we want to dismiss or want to get away from [[Conceptual Framework|conceptual frameworks]], but we do not realise actually just how supportive it is. Actually a better analogy than the trellis would be, for the roses in a rose garden or something, would be a tree - perhaps a fruit tree. The tree is its own structure. The roots, the trunk, the branches, all of that, the shape of that, we could say that the conceptual framework is like the structure of a tree. You understand? It forms a structure. What is perhaps better about the tree analogy is that it is not like the structure is one thing and the [[soulmaking]] is another thing, as it was in the trellis analogy to the roses. Here the structure, the conceptual structure, is a part of [[soul]]. It is an aspect of the tree, it is totally integrated with the tree, the trunk, the roots the branches, the structure, the shape of that is the tree. It is part of the tree, it is completely [[Embodiment|embodied]], incorporated. They are not separate things. So [[logos]] and conceptual framework is part, a dimension, an aspect of soul and soulmaking and [[psyche]]. ^2-1
###### 2-2
Even though we say [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos]], remember I said they are not really separate. So that might be a useful analogy. And then we have the fruit and the [[beauty]] and the flowers of the tree and all that a tree can offer, or even a whole [[Conceptual Framework|orchard of trees]]. But the structure of the tree is the tree. And also in the tree analogy or the fruit tree analogy, it is not a fixed structure. So the structure of that tree is organic, it grows, just as our conceptual framework can and as I have been saying needs to grow, the [[logos]] needs to grow. Just like a tree it is not a fixed, limited, preset, rigid structure. It is actually organic and it grows, and that growing of the tree and of the conceptual frameworks are responsive. In other words, they respond. If you look at the way, let us say, an apple tree grows in an orchard, you will see how responsive it is to the light as plants are phototropic to different degrees. It responds to the light, it responds to the other trees around it, it responds to all kinds of things. It responds also to itself when it is getting too heavy or too lopsided etc., and sometimes that response is it actually breaks. A branch breaks off or the tree splits in two, a crack appears. Sometimes the tree gets too big for itself and the conceptual frameworks can also break, get too big, a crack appears etc.. ^2-2
###### 2-3
Can we include that fact, that organic fact of the way trees grow as organic, and that organic fact about [[Conceptual Framework|conceptuality]] and conceptual frameworks, can we include that in a sort of larger scale conceptual framework? So right there there is this [[Kabbala|Kabbalistic]] idea, mythical idea of the [[Vessel|breaking of the vessels]], Shevirat ha-Kelim. And one kind of vessel, as I said, is a conceptual framework, and those too, in our life, they break at times. And though that can be very difficult - and I will come back to this - I would also say, sad the person whose conceptual framework does not break at least once in their life. I will come back to that. But here we have perhaps an analogy where the structure is not separate from the fruit, from the [[soulmaking]], from what the [[soul]] is. It is not fixed, it is organic, it grows. That is part of its nature. And it grows in a responsive way with what is around it. And the breaking might be part of it. ^2-3
###### 2-4
Now I have also said - and one of the things that is really worth repeating is - when I say concept or [[logos]] or [[conceptual framework]] or even idea, I am not just referring to something abstract, something removed, taken away from life, away from [[experience]], away from an [[embodiment]] into some kind of disembodied, intellectual, separate sort of realm of the mind. There can be that; we can have conceptual frameworks that is what we are doing with them and that is what they have become for us. And we can include that. But mostly I am really talking about what we live, an indispensable element of our existence that comes into our life that we actually end up embodying whether we know it or like it or not, comes into our experience. Mostly I am not even talking about what we think. Certainly a conceptual framework - we can elucidate it and elaborate on it in words and thoughts and we reflect on it and put it together with other ideas and make sure we understand all that thinking. Of course I am including that. But I am also making the point I have made before that concept, logos, as I would use that word, operates even when we are not thinking. Even in the [[Jhanas|second jhana]] and other jhanas and those kind of experience, there is not thinking going on but there is conceptuality going on. ^2-4
###### 3-1
If we do not see that, if you do not see that, and I know some people are really wedded to the idea of nonconceptual [[awareness]] in different ways - for some people it means [[Attention|bare attention]], for others it is kind of got a [[Dzogchen]] context - but if you do not see that then what I would unfortunately or fortunately say to you is it just needs more practice. You need to practice with more subtlety of sensitivity and noticing, but particularly you need to practice in the direction of less [[fabrication]], so much so that you begin to see the relationship with conceptualities in the [[present moment]] in the mind, how they not just shape the fabrication and therefore the [[experience]] but actually how they contribute, how they actually fabricate anything at all. In other words, without conception, if you really drop all conception, nothing gets fabricated. No experience gets fabricated. So that where there is conception it fabricates experience, and where there is experience there is some conception bound up, wrapped up, in that experience. So even the barest level of [[Conceptual Framework|conceptuality]], [[Ways of Looking|some kind of knowing]] with some kind of knower and known, therefore subject and object, the barest, barest, most refined level, and some kind of sense of a present moment: that is conceptuality. Subject, object and time is the barest level of conceptuality. And pulled almost immediately in with all that is a whole bunch of other stuff about potentiality and change and therefore past and future and all that. ^3-1
###### 3-2
But even that - and I do not have any label for what is [[Perception|appearing]] as object, what is known, it can be a very subtle perception - but where there is perception, [[experience]], appearance, there is concept. Certainly at the level of [[mindfulness]] and so called [[Attention|bare attention]], you know, you just need to play with "is there a [[Conceptual Framework|subtle concept]]?" - this is now a less subtle of conceptuality - but is there a relatively subtle concept I am not even conscious of? "This is what I am mindful of," but for example, "am I regarding it as something real? Am I regarding it as something material?" - whatever it is, this tree that I am looking at, this touch of the foot on the earth, and what is wrapped up in that concept of [[Materialism|materiality]]? Am I regarding it as an appearance, which is a more, if you know the philosophical term, more of a [[Phenomenology|phenomenological bracketing]] there? It is appearance - that is already regarding it as appearance. A mindfulness that regards this touch of the foot as appearance is different already than a mindfulness that unconsciously, automatically, out of [[habit]] regards that touch as the meeting of materials, the foot and the earth. ^3-2
###### 3-3
Anyway. there is always a [[conceptual framework]]. there is always a [[logos]]. there is always a [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] when there is any [[experience]] apart from the so called experience of the [[unfabricated]]. which is a very different kind of thing where there is no time, no knowing of subject or object, knowing subject or knowing object, knowing of object. There is always conceptual framework, there is always a concept, a logos, which creates a way of looking, which is part of the way of looking, which if you like is part of determining the experience - not just the interpretation, the [[Hermeneutics#Overview|hermeneutics]], of this experience, but the experience itself is part of [[Fabrication|fabricating]]. So when I am talking now about conceptual framework and logos or idea - and I probably use those words interchangeably - I am talking about something that we want it to be translatable, incorporate-able into a way of looking so that it is fruitful, so that it is fertile, so that it opens up our [[perception]] and our experience. We are talking about something that we live. ^3-3
###### 3-4
There is always, as I will come back to, I have said before in other talks, there is always a [[metaphysics]]. There is always some belief about what is real. And there is always some [[Conceptual Framework|conceptuality]] there. And we actually want that to come - we want to be able to employ different conceptual frameworks that are actually fertile, that give rise to open up our [[experience]], and that we can actually embody in our life. ^3-4
###### 3-5
Now for me, I would say, and you will have to see how much you feel the same way, but for me I would say if we are interested in building a [[conceptual framework]], opening one up, [[Create-Discover|discovering/creating]] a conceptual framework in the [[dharma]] and in relation to [[eros]] and [[soulmaking]], then it is going to need to be able to do quite a lot or support quite a lot, the way I see it right now. It is going to need to account for quite a few things, quite a few aspects of [[experience]], and it is going to have to include and not ignore quite a few things. And I will give a list of things. It is going to need to make sense of quite a few things in our experience etc. It is going to need to give a vital place to and a purpose to quite a few things, and also connect those things. So it needs to account for, include and not ignore, make sense of, give vital place and purpose to, and connect quite a few different elements of our experience. ^3-5
###### 4-1
One is this whole observation that we have of [[Fabrication|lessening fabrication]]. And that whole spectrum of fabrication that we can discover in [[meditation]], it is not random. It is not just things disappear because they are [[Impermanence|impermanent]]. We actually see there is a whole spectrum more or less fabricated, all the way down to no fabrication at all, no [[experience]]. We need to understand the [[dependent origination]] there, what that is dependent of, and [[Conceptual Framework|conceptuality]], and identification and [[Ignorance|avijja]], [[clinging]]. We talked about this all before. But that fact, somehow I need to account for it and include it. I can not just kind of skip over that. And coming out of that observable spectrum of fabrication, its relationship or its dependent arising, either coming out of that or some other way, the [[Emptiness|emptiness of all things]], all things without question - not leaving anything not empty; not leaving the [[Skandhas|aggregates]], the process, the time, the [[Awareness|big awareness]], being, [[Materialism|materiality]], atoms, electrons, subatomic particles. Emptiness of all, all, all; space, time, and all of that. Somehow this to me has to be included. If we do not then something remains not empty and we start building a whole structure on that assumption of reality which is relatively easily disproved in one way or another. And of course that is what sometimes happens, either consciously, or a person does not even realise that they are assuming the reality of this or that, assuming the non-emptiness of this or that, and then just saying "yes yes yes, emptiness, of course," but there is some basis in reality there and everything is coming out of that as a foundation of this real thing, whatever it is - materiality, and then you have got a [[neuroscience]]-based [[dharma]]; or, you know, atomistic process or whatever it is. ^4-1
###### 4-2
So [[fabrication]], the spectrum of fabrication, [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]], the [[emptiness]] of absolutely everything. And also for me, the whole opening up of the idea of [[ways of looking]], the plurality, the legitimacy of a whole manifold range of ways of looking, not because we want to be nice guys - and I actually think I am a nice guy but that is not the reason, that I am just trying not to get into an argument with someone so I just say everyone's way of looking is fine. That is actually not what I am saying, and that is not the reason. It is coming out of emptiness, it is going deeply into fabrication, very deeply, and seeing the emptiness of all things, seeing what are we left with. We are left with a range, an option of ways of looking, the diversity, the flexibility of ways of looking. And somehow in all that I also need to account for, make sense of, and give purpose to the whole and really structure the whole relationship of the fabricated with the [[unfabricated]]. And then where does this thing that people call [[mindfulness]] or [[Attention|bare attention]] fit into that. So this we have talked about before. But somehow my [[conceptual framework]] has to, as I said, account for and include all this. I can not just ignore this spectrum of fabrication, I can not forget that everything is empty. ^4-2
###### 4-3
So all of that, but then also, again, what the [[conceptual framework]] that to me would really be healthy and relatively robust and [[beauty]] making and supportive and all that, needs also to account for, include, make sense of, give vital place and purpose to, and connect all of these with the other ideas - so also [[Image|images]] and the [[imaginal]] and what does that mean. Are we just going to discount the whole imaginative faculty that human beings have? The noticing of the fact that our life is full of [[fantasy]] anyway? The whole movement of [[soulmaking]]? Again are we just going to ignore it and pretend that that is not something that is part of our existence to more or less degrees for different human beings at different times? It already exists, all this. Are we going to dismiss it? Are we going to ignore it? Or actually are we going to [[Create-Discover|construct and discover]] a conceptual framework that can, you know, hold all this together and give it life? ^4-3
###### 5-1
And again, you know, part of that of course is and we can talk about [[eros]] and [[desire]] and [[sexuality]]. Again, are we just chopping that stuff off, or over-simplistically reducing it, or dismissing it, or labelling it in too reductive or not subtle enough ways? And body, body, you know, are we limiting what body is to us and can be to us? Do we just have a materialist reductionist view of body, or I just see it through the lens of sort of the way we have been taught the four foundations of [[mindfulness]], as the first foundation or something? Body. How much that has been left out of - until quite recently, and even then it is hardly made any inroads - how much that has been left out of western philosophy and psychology, [[embodiment]] and what the body is and what the body can be for us to us. Where there is [[soulmaking]], where there is this expansion of [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros psyche logos]], the body too will be drawn into that. I will come back to this. ^5-1
###### 5-2
So somehow a [[conceptual framework]] has to actually include body and give more place to body and more purpose to body, different accounts of body. And then of course also just the whole of the [[Personhood|human being]]. And again, what is our conceptual framework saying about what a human being is? Because that too is [[soulmaking]], will be expanded, broadened, deepened, given dimension. Am I just sticking it into, again, a kind of evolutionary accident emerging from the primal swamp after long enough time by the vagaries of [[Neuroscience|biochemistry]]? Or the human being is just what [[Modernism|secular modernism]] says the human being is? And related to that, of course, [[relationships]]. What are [[Human Relationship|human relationships]]? Does my conceptual framework allow the growth and the expansion, the widening and deepening, of the sense and the concept of what my human relationships are? Or again am I just putting it into some modernist secular box or whatever it is, or Marxist box, or whatever. [[Death]]. Can the whole conceptual framework support opening to the relationship with death? How often the conversation about death and relationship with it seems so sort of flatly polarised: after death, what will happen after death, is there anything after death? And it revolves around this [[rebirth]] or [[heaven]] or [[hell]] or this state or [[Oneness|dissolving into oneness]] or whatever. ^5-2
###### 5-3
What are you now? Never mind what you will be or what will happen. What is happening now? If I see that flatly, if I am limited in what I actually sense and see happening now, if my [[soul]]'s looking and sensing of this existence now is limited, what is this? What is even this now? What is time? All of that, when that gets limited, then it just becomes "[[Death|after death]], after death, will it be just extinction," or "it is extinction," "no, it is not," or "there is [[rebirth]]," you know. It is a flat, polarised, kind of naive and unhelpful argument. ^5-3
###### 5-4
A friend's mother is dying, the friend, he said, "she does not believe in something better than what she has on earth" as if that is the only [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] at it. What do you have on earth? How is time woven into all this? And is there a way of, you know, some people respond to [[death]], "oh well, who dies? No one dies because there is [[Anatta|no self]] or it is just a process that then disbands or whatever. There was no self, so then death is ok," or "you just dissolve into the universal being or the universal [[Brahman]] or whatever it is or dissolve into God or whatever." Or someone says, "no, it is just - all that is rubbish. It is just a tragedy. Itt's just an actual tragedy. Here was this wonderful [[Personhood|human being]] and now they are just gone and there is nothing but unremitting loss about death." Is there a way, are there ways of relating to death, that include all those possibilities but add the whole dimension of [[the self]]? So the self is not just dismissed - who dies, no one dies because there is no one, because there is no self - just a simplistic answer - or the self just gets dissolved back into a universal, amorphous, unparticularised being. Is there a relationship with death not bound by time, not bound by any idea about something lasting or what will happen later or anything like that in time after death, that actually still has a place for the self, a [[soul]] place for the self? So all of this our [[conceptual framework]] has to be able to open up and support quite a lot more than is often the case in relation to all these aspects of our existence, and of course in relation to the earth and the environment, how desperately, desperately we are in need of a new relationship, a new conception, a new [[perception]], a new [[cosmology]], really, something that can offer support. real respect. real openness in regard to the earth, the environment, the cosmos. But also the senses. Again, how are we seeing the senses, how are we conceiving of the senses? And again, some interpretations of [[Dharma|Buddhadharma]], it is as if the senses can be these basic instruments that reveal [[Attention|bare attention]]. Other versions of dharma have, you know, the senses are effectively what you are trying to get rid of ultimately in some kind of transcendent dissolution. But the earth, the environment, the cosmos, the senses, the [[beauty]], beauties. Can our conceptual framework open up the possibilities for beauty, for discovering and creating beauty? How does our notion of the dharma support or inhibit that? ^5-4
###### 6-1
And our [[conceptual framework]] needs, of course, to do all this - account for, make sense of, give place, purpose, connect different aspects. Our [[Meditation|dharma practices]], how does all that connect? The ones we have maybe learned, and new ones that we can discover for ourselves, and how do they all fit together? And psychology. Again, there is a sense of what is taken as truth in psychology, or the [[psychology of a person]], or a [[child development]]. What is, you know, the whole notion of, or rather the whole possibilities of psychology? Because that too must expand if the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros psyche logos dynamic]] expands. Psychology, [[logos]]. Logos needs to expand. And as I have said many times before, the whole sense of [[Divinity|sacredness]], the range of that, and this whole notion of divinity, and what that might that mean, or what can that mean, and how can that open up and become something that is supported and fertile. And if we talk about divinity again, how does the conceptual framework relate to and conceive of the whole relationship of, say, the [[Fabrication|spectrum of fabrication]] with the fact tied in with that that our [[perception]] can seem more or less substantial with the refinement and moving up and down of that spectrum of fabrication? And do we just associate that with less substantial, more refined, more ethereal, is somehow more divine? Is that how we relate? Or is there some other way that actually gives as much divinity to both ends of that spectrum? Are there other ways of conceiving that support a kind of non-hierarchicalised notion of divinity, of the range of, of the spectrum of what divinity can be and how we can sense it? ^6-1
###### 6-2
So notion of [[dimensionality]] I have said is related to [[divinity]], and somehow what is the [[conceptual framework]] in relation to the sense of dimensionality we discover in our [[experience]] as we pay [[attention]], as we experiment. There is always more dimensionality. Maybe that is tied in with the whole sense of divinity: the always more, the unfathomability of divinity. But in 'always more', it is not necessary that the more is closer to divinity just because it is more and I have not fathomed it yet. So there is a lot here that a conceptual framework needs to take account for, include, not ignore, make sense of, give place and purpose to, and kind of stitch together in a supportive framework. All that, for me, I would say. For me - again, maybe you agree, maybe you do not - these are important things. These things matter to us, matter deeply. They make a big difference. The conceptual framework and the concepts and the beliefs and assumptions about all this stuff, [[Perception|perceptions]] of all this stuff. ^6-2
###### 6-3
Now another aspect of all of this that is, for me, a requirement is we need to acknowledge as I have already pointed out not just that concept and percept - the [[conceptual framework]] and [[experience]] - are mutual dependent originations (in other words, where there is concept there is experience, and that concept is part of [[Fabrication|fabricating that experience]], shaping, determining that experience, giving rise to that experience; and also of course that the concepts we have are formed by experiences, so at least some of them - there is a mutual [[dependent origination]] there to some extent), but in addition to that, both idea-concept-[[logos]]-conceptual framework and experience are both situated, they are contextually conditioned. So that [[history]] and society, ideas-logoi-conceptual frameworks, and experience-[[Perception|perceptions]]-appearances, whatever you want to call those three, history, society, ideas, and experience are mutually conditioning. They are hardly separable. In other words, ideas emerge in history and are borrowed from history. We inherit certain ideas from history. Ideas also shape history. And both of those shape our experience. And of course experiences emerge and they become ideas and shape history that way. There is a mutual conditioning between all those three. ^6-3
###### 7-1
So what that means in relationship to conceiving of a [[conceptual framework]] that is supportive to [[soulmaking]] and [[eros]] and everything that we are talking about, is that, we can not claim, it would be silly to claim a kind of [[History|ahistoricality]], like we are now talking about some truth, this conceptual framework is the truth, it is ahistorical, it is transcendent of all history, it is not situated in this culture, in this time, with this historical influx of ideas and all the rest of it. It is totally contextual. So we somehow need to admit that and actually give relevance and place to that, yeah? And maybe even purpose to that, which hopefully is something I will come back to. So for example in the story that I related of the yogi [[Retreat|on retreat]] the other day and her need for the earth and the woods to touch and address and cherish - to cherish - her particularities, her self, her [[The Self|particular self]], her unique self. In other words, in the way we are speaking about, for her what was needed there was her self, in its particularity, in its uniqueness, to be more fully included and involved in the [[Imaginal|imaginal constellation]] so that there was a balance there in the expanding [[soulmaking dynamic]], eros psyche logos, and also so that as part of that the self became an [[Image|erotic image]] (either for the self, or in this case for the object or the image reciprocally). ^7-1
###### 7-2
So her need for that, someone could say, "But surely that is just a creation, a [[fabrication]], demanded now or kind of conditioned or even forced by the rise of the [[The Self|modernist self]] which was a sense of self that did not exist before." In other words, go back far enough in [[history]], read whatever documents we have, get a sense , and it is like it is hard to really believe that the sense of self that we so much take for granted now in [[Modernism|modernity]], in the time of modernity and [[Dominant Culture|western culture]], is the same kind of sense of self of the people the [[Buddha]] was talking to. You simply do not get the same sense of complexity or difficulty in regard to certain psychological interiorities that we now have that we absolutely take for granted, and we feel viscerally, "This is my self, this is important." Or perhaps even in the [[Old Testament]], as well, as well as the hPali Canon. This modernist self, as quite a few philosophers have pointed out, it is a creation, it is a construction. It is not, so to speak, an independently existing reality. ^7-2
###### 7-3
That is not to say - some [[The Self|sense of self]] will always be there, but the actual sense of self and the complex interior arised psychological self that seems to exist in some kind of independent way etc. that we feel so normally nowadays is a creation of [[modernism]], of western modernism. And were it not for that creation this person is pointing out, then there is no need for the creation of an [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]] of the earth being in [[love]] with me as felt as a modernist self. There is a double construction there to which I would say, "Yes, absolutely there is a double construction, there is a double construction there". [[Soulmaking]], [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros psyche logos]] , creates as much as it discovers. So yes, [[fabrication]], yes, construction, but that does not make it less soulmaking. It is like there is a whole soulmaking process here that we could actually say includes [[history]], includes the ideas that are bequeathed to us. So the modernist self is, to a certain extent, a soulmaking construction, historically emergent, [[Dominant Culture|culturally contingent]], all of that. ^7-3
###### 7-4
It is a [[Soulmaking|soulmaking construction]]. And then it demands - its [[logos]] begins to break and it does not support enough [[eros]], does not support enough soulmaking - demands another construction. That whole [[History|historical movement]] could be regarded as soulmaking. I am going to come back to this. But yes, acknowledging that it is a creation, a construction, a [[fabrication]] does not make it less soulmaking. On the contrary. It does not make it less divine either in the way that I would be talking about [[divinity]]. And does not even make it less real, because you would have to ask, "compared to what?" Show me something that is not fabricated. Show me something that is not fabricated. So "it is created, it is fabricated, therefore it is not real," compared to what? ^7-4
###### 7-5
Or to stay awhile with this point of mutual conditioning of [[history]], society, ideas, [[logos]], [[conceptual framework]], and [[experience]], [[perception]], appearance. I wonder how many of you have had this experience that I have had, and I do not think it is that uncommon. Perhaps you are with a relative or a loved one, someone who you [[love]] deeply, and perhaps they are ill, for example. And perhaps you massage their feet or held their feet or somehow held something of their body. Perhaps they were dying. And somehow in the holding and in the love and in the [[Eros|erotic love]] - and I do not just mean sexual love - in the erotic love there this person's feet, this loved one's feet, became holy. Maybe even became, somehow in the perception there, in the [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]], they gained a [[dimensionality]] or dimensionalities of holiness. Maybe they even became [[Jesus]]' feet, body, the feet of the Christ, perhaps the crucified Christ. And wrapped up in that kind of thing, there is [[Divinity|something sacred]] about this person. This person that I love, their [[The Self|particularity]], their body, something sacred. And something sacred about Christ or Jesus or whatever, and something sacred spreading from that to all bodies, and perhaps in the [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]] as well. So there is some degree of that movement happening. ^7-5
###### 8-1
Now you could say, of course, if it is, let us say, the sense of touching [[Jesus]]' feet there, how rich that is. Some people this will not resonate with at all, but for a lot of people [[Dominant Culture|in our culture]], not just people who have Christian backgrounds or were raised Christian, that [[image]] has such a richness and a poignancy and a [[beauty]] and a [[poetry]] to it. So you could say, "oh sure, but you are having that [[experience]] because you are just kind of recalling a cultural icon that you have been fed or conditioned from the culture, from your background, from your family or whatever." And we could say, yes, sure, sure, that is part of what is going on. We are fed that image and it has worked its way into the collective [[psyche]]. It might actually be almost eroded now at this point in [[history]] but still it is there. So sure, acknowledge that. And, both now and even originally in the actual historic occurrence of Jesus' [[Christianity|crucifixion]] and all that, with the apostles, the 12 disciples who became the apostles, both now in this experience and in the original, could it also be that both you in this experience of your loved one's feet, and [[Mary]] or whoever it was, Joseph of Arimathea and these people, were tapping in to an archetype that kind of pre-existed Jesus, if you like? An archetype of the Christ and the martyred one and everything that is wrapped up in there about [[death]] and [[divinity]] and an exceptionally [[soulmaking]], beautiful [[love]]. So there is a tapping in to an archetype, we could say that, a kind of primordially archetype in a [[Carl Gustav Jung|Jungian]] sense. Sure. So that is - it could be both. ^8-1
###### 8-2
And it could be that in the original [[experience]] historically in the [[Christianity#New Testament|New Testament]] with [[Mary]] and then [[St. Paul|Paul]] coming with his theology of the body of Christ etc., all that was exactly the movement of [[Eros|erotic love]] stimulating, fertilising, opening, widening and deepening, and giving dimension and [[divinity]] to, what it came into contact with as the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros psyche logos dynamic]] was stimulated and fertilised. In other words, there is this eros to this person. Paul I do not think ever met [[Jesus]], but maybe it was Mary, and Jesus' person became [[image]] for Paul, and there was an erotic connection there, for Mary and for the others. Erotic connection to this person of Jesus fertilised and deepened and widened the [[soulmaking]] and thus the [[perception]] of the body of Jesus, and other bodies related to his, and [[the self]], and the [[Cosmology|cosmos]], and all of that. And out of that a theology was woven, via Paul and all that, St. Paul. And this theology somehow preserved Jesus' uniqueness, his uniqueness and his person, and somehow connected flesh and divinity. And in some theologies it spills over into the cosmology of the cosmic Christ etc. and the whole kind of divine nature of the universe. ^8-2
###### 8-3
So in this third possibility we are not just tapping into a kind of pre-existing [[Archtetype|primordial archetype]], but the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros psyche logos dynamic]] as it expands is actually creating an archetype, creating a [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]], creating a theology. Maybe that was what was going on both historically at the time of [[Jesus]] and also now. The eros psyche logos, it will tend to divinise. And of course what happened back then 2000 years ago was historically conditioned, the kind of [[logos]] that came out of that, you can also trace it to the [[Old Testament]] and other ideas that were around and Greek ideas. But you can not escape cosmology, partly because you can not escape from [[history]] and society. The cosmology, you know, that was historically around back then, and the kind of [[Messianism]] and [[Judaism]] and all that, of course that informed. But there was also something else happening in - you could say the eros psyche logos dynamic was doing what it does and how it would [[Alchemy|transubstantiate]] things. We touched on this in the last [[retreat]]. And the idea that you can get away from any kind of cosmology that is in the [[Dominant Culture|present culture]] and get away from history and society - I am going to come back to this - that is highly questionable. ^8-3
###### 9-1
Or again, as a third example, you know, the idea, the [[conceptual framework]], the [[logos]] of a cosmic or [[Eros|divine eros]], that idea that we have touched upon, it will seed it will feed and support. Think of that orchard image of the tree. It will seed and support the actual sense, the [[perception]], the [[experience]], the [[image]] of that, of a cosmic and divine eros. The idea supports, seeds and supports, the experience intrapsychically with intrapsychic images, and then inevitably with the perception of the world, if I do not get in the way of that. And the reverse: this idea of a cosmic or divine eros that somehow I am mirroring or that is permeating the [[Cosmology|cosmos]]. All these different ideas, those ideas, that image, that [[Fantasy|mythos]], will emerge from and be seeded by both, I would say - historically is my guess, historically but certainly now; you can see it also in practice, how something opens in experience and then a little while later you read something and discover that someone had this idea that corresponds to your experience. Someone had it, you know, a long time ago. ^9-1
###### 9-2
Both historically and now, the idea or the [[Fantasy|mythos]] emerges from [[experience]] and [[perception]] opening in the mystical experience, in the [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]], and in the [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]] that comes from that. Because the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros psyche logos dynamic]] is operating, everything is gaining dimension and thus divinised. The [[divinity]] comes with the [[dimensionality]]. So eventually as we said before, even the [[eros]] gets given dimensionality and divinised and expanded. There is a sense - there is an actual - I am not even thinking it first, but just from following the mystical and imaginal perceptions, not getting in the way, eventually eros appears divine. And then that gives me the idea, "Oh, this is God's eros. I am participating in it. I am mirroring it. This eros that I have, this [[love]] that I have, echoes, mirrors, has roots in", whatever. ^9-2
###### 9-3
Any [[conceptual framework]] that I would like to be involved with or that I would feel like I can get behind needs to acknowledge that it is not some kind of [[ultimate truth]]. It is not depicting some 'way things really are' in some independent way. Nor is it some ultimately true kind of grand theory, conceptual framework of everything that is completely [[History|ahistorical]]. So it needs to acknowledge all that. It is not ultimate truth and it is not completely ahistorical. But at the same time it needs to, as I said, recognise there is always a [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] and included in the way of looking is the conceptual framework. A [[logos]] is operating always when there is [[experience]]. And that way of looking and that conceptual framework will give rise to experience, shape, determine, and actually give rise to experience; and of course the experiences we have shape and inform the conceptual framework and the ways of looking. ^9-3
###### 9-4
But it is not possible to be without a [[conceptual framework]] or a [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]]. And if you do not know that, it is like, find that out, find that out. Know that that is true. So somehow we need to recognise that, that needs to be included, and we need - with all this, all of these - somehow we need a conceptual framework, we need something that supports [[soulmaking]]. And we need - related to that, I am going to run through a list, and then go back through them more slowly. We need a conceptual framework that supports soulmaking. We need a [[logos]], a conceptual framework, that supports, I would say, the fertility and widening of our [[experience]] and [[Insight|understanding]]. We need to make sure that - the third aspect now, related. So fertility and widening. And related to that we need to make sure that we are not engaging in [[Epistemology#Epistemicide|epistemicide]]. I only learned that word the other day but I was thinking along similar lines. I will come back to this. Epistemicide, the killing, the erasure, or the dismissal of ways of knowing. ^9-4
###### 9-5
That we are not, fourthly, reducing to some kind of [[dogma]] that there is just one [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] that is valid, and that way of looking reveals the true reality of things. Often that is what happens in [[Modernism|secular modernity]], that there is a kind of [[monotheism]], a secular modernist monotheism in terms of [[ontology]] (what is real, what is not real), [[epistemology]] (what are the valid ways of knowing and what are the not valid ways of knowing) and [[cosmology]] (what kind of world we live in, what is the nature of the world we live in). And so shrinking that down to there is just one way of looking - call it [[mindfulness]] or science or whatever you want to call it - and that reveals the reality of things. That is actually a kind of monotheism, whether it is religious or secular or whatever. It goes with modernism, actually. I will come back to this. ^9-5
###### 10-1
Fifthly we need to - as I have already touched on - somehow incorporate, this [[conceptual framework]], it needs to incorporate [[dependent origination]], [[ways of looking]], but principally the [[Emptiness|emptiness of things]]. And so actually related to what I have said before, but a sixth is, perhaps, some conceptual framework that actually opens the ways of knowing, [[Embodiment|embodied ways of knowing]], without a prescribed limit. So how - going back to what I have said before; this is a variation of what I said before - but how fertile is it? Am I putting a limit? And are there ways of knowing that are not just mental, rational, disembodied? Can the conceptual framework, as I said, include the idea that the conceptual framework breaks? And that the [[Vessel|breaking of the vessels]] is in some way included in the very conceptual framework, and the larger conceptual framework? And also what I said much earlier in the [[retreat]]: acknowledge and live with and integrate the idea that we can never fully understand [[eros]], either because we say it is divine or unfathomable, or because of the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros psyche logos dynamic]] expanding always the nature of eros itself, the [[perception]], the concept of eros itself. Somehow all of those need to get integrated into our conceptual framework. ^10-1
