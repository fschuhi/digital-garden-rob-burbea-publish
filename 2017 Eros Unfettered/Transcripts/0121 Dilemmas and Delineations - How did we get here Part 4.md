###### 1-1
Now, I am aware that these are - well, many of these, at least, are quite unfamiliar ideas for many people, maybe even many [[Dharma]] people, and maybe in the culture. So I want to just say something about that. It is a lot easier to teach Dharma, or rather there is no objection, which makes it easier when we teach Dharma or present something as Dharma, in the cases where we mix in all kinds of assumptions, or frames of reference, or conceptual bases, or conceptual biases as well, as long as they are well-established in Western modernist culture and assumed to be true by that culture. So when you mix those kind of ideas in and assumptions in and package it all as, quote, "Dharma" - for instance, [[neuroscience]] or some of the ideas from modern psychotherapy - and you introduce them and they become absorbed or blended into, quote, "Dharma," that is a lot easier. Rarely does anyone's eyebrows get raised or anyone have a problem with that. ^1-1
###### 1-2
When one tries to introduce or open up more unfamiliar ideas, ideas that are not popular or populist in the culture, that is more difficult. And more than that, when one, if you like, adds something so to speak "foreign" or new to what we might call the [[Dharma]], when it is foreign or new, that addition is much more conspicuous as an addition than when they are sort of ideas that people are familiar with from their culture. It is still happening; it is still an addition. There is still an addition, even when it is not obvious when we add ideas about [[neuroscience]] or modern psychotherapy ideas or whatever. It is still happening, nevertheless. Something is being added. It is just not so obvious. ^1-2
###### 1-3
Add to that this other idea that the ideas we are using are not truth claims, they do not refer to realities, and that is very difficult sometimes for people to get their heads around, as well, because we are used to hearing, "It is like this," or "It is like that," or thinking that [[Dharma]] concepts refer to realities, et cetera. Certainly when we think about [[neuroscience]] or modern psychotherapy ideas, almost without exception, there is the assumption and the message that these are realities. So it is quite difficult sometimes to hear something or to try and present something as, "These ideas do not have truth claims in the way that we usually operate with truth claims and truth assumptions." So, unfamiliar. I am aware of that, and I am certainly aware of the difficulties in trying to present all this. But still, I insist, absolutely insist, that in our Dharma - in other words, in your Dharma, in your practice, and in your life - [[fantasy]] and [[image]] is already involved. It is already involved in Dharma, in practice and life. I absolutely insist on that. And I also insist that this is not a bad thing. Not at all a bad thing. It is inevitable, and it is important, and it may well, I would say, be necessary. It is certainly necessary to galvanize in relation to practice and Dharma and to be inspired in life and to have [[meaningfulness]]. All that is necessary. So it is not a bad thing. We need to recognize both the general fact that it is operating, and also the particular ways that it is operating for us, that fantasy and image operate for us, and the kinds, the directions in which fantasy and image operate and mix in with our life and impel our life. So we need a double level of recognition: general and a more individual, particular. ^1-3
###### 1-4
Out of that, we need to kind of expand a psychology that can talk about that and include all that, recognize it and be sensitive to it and be wise in relationship to it, instead of just not admitting it, not seeing it, or trying to cut it because it is [[Papanca|papañca]]. We need to include, then, in this psychology, in this [[conceptual framework]], we need to include ideas such as [[soulmaking]] or [[eros]] that are not yet articulated in what we call [[Dharma]]. To me, that seems a necessity, you know, something that is called for. When we look at our life and the movements of our life with a psychology that is too simplistic, it does not serve us. It does not serve the totality of our being. ^1-4
###### 1-5
A person says, "Well, that is just vedanā leading." So when you talk about [[eros]] or that kind of thing, "That is just vedanā leading. You are just chasing the pleasant or running away from the unpleasant," or "That is just [[Papanca|papañca]]," when we talk about the [[imaginal]] or [[fantasy]]; what motivates us is either this movement governed by vedanā towards pleasant and unpleasant, or some people teach that basically we get attached to things like views because we are trying to shore up this self that somehow, deep down, we know is not real, therefore we attach, we [[Clinging|cling]] to this and this, to try and shore up my views and my [[Habit|habits]] and all that. But that kind of psychology, this self shoring up or the vedanā leading, that that is what is going on, or it is just [[metta]] - I have touched on this before - this is, in a way, not sophisticated enough. It is a little bit poor as a psychology. Valuable as it is - we have talked about this - we need something richer, deeper, wider; a psychology that can accommodate and [[Delineations|delineate]] between the kinds of things that we are talking about. ^1-5
###### 2-1
So from our perspective, the movement to seek to increase pleasure or decrease unpleasant sensations, when that is the prime intention of a movement of [[Embodiment|body]] or [[mind]], when that is the prime driver, to maximize or increase pleasant sensations and decrease unpleasant ones, when that is the prime driver and there is not this richness of what we call [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]], then that is axiomatically (in the way that we are talking about it) not [[soulmaking]]. That is not creating [[Soul|soulfulness]]. It will not do that. It is not [[eros]]. It is what we might call [[craving]], as I said. But to think too much that way, or to really regard as if that is the thing that mostly moves us as human beings, it is a really, really poor psychology. But it is interesting - this kind of need to expand the psychology a little bit and enrich the psychology a little bit, it is not just in the [[Dharma]] transmission, in the Dharma circles. It is in the wider, culture, too. ^2-1
###### 2-2
I had an oncologist until recently and he prescribed me the standard course of chemotherapy for my condition, but he basically - I think he basically thought it would not work because of the disease I had and the stage it was at and all that. It would not work, so there was no point trying to do any more chemotherapy, plus it was also potentially dangerous and it was not a risk that he was prepared to take for different reasons - a) that it might do more harm than good, I think is what he thought. But in trying to persuade me to sort of give up wanting to experiment a little bit with longer and more chemotherapy, et cetera, he would often say something like, "It is about quality of life. Come off the chemo and just enjoy the duration of the rest of your life with a better quality of life." He would often say this, and I often had the feeling that he and I understood very different things about what constituted a good quality of life. But then he would also say "quality of life" and then say a bit more, and often he would say, "go on holiday." He would often say that as part of his sort of package of what quality of life meant and what I could do if I was off chemo, as I could go on holiday. That is probably partly reflecting just - as an NHS oncologist, he was probably grossly overworked and overstretched, and probably was desperately needing a break and [[craving]] a holiday. But he did not say, "... quality of life, so you can go on pilgrimage." In a medieval peasant in Christendom, or in Tibetan Buddhists even nowadays, or a Muslim nowadays, if they were told, "You probably only have some months to live," one of the responses might be, from the doctor saying that, "You know, take the time off the medication. You might be able to make a pilgrimage." Very different mindset. What is the difference? Well, one, typically - I mean, this is not black and white, but - one [[Desire|desires]] or seeks a reduction in stress, an increase in pleasure, perhaps seeking out novel or exciting experiences, whereas the pilgrimage, in contrast to holiday, pilgrimage is a movement of [[soulmaking]], an actual movement that is soulmaking; an [[embodiment]] of [[eros]], something we do with our bodies that is an erotic movement that brings soulmaking. It is interesting. Different cultures, ancient and contemporary, religious and secular, tend to assume a universality of wants - that people want this or that, or most people want this. In the modern secular West, the choice we have of what we seek is actually wider, and perhaps wider than at any point in the whole [[history]] of humanity. That is one of the things that actually characterizes [[modernism]] - well, secularity, particularly, and also consumerism. So the choice is wider. And also individuality has a certain premium in modern secular [[Dominant Culture|Western culture]], so it is acknowledged that the individual, the person, has a choice that needs to be respected to a certain extent in what is important to them. But still, there is usually a presumption that most people will conform to what is, we could say, popular, secular values, and that what you will want is a holiday as opposed to something like a pilgrimage. ^2-2
###### 2-3
[13:34] So with all this, and all this talk about [[eros]] and exploration of eros, I really want to emphasize again something you have heard in relation to the [[Dharma]] before, I am sure. Do not believe; these teachings, the [[Buddha]] said, are ehipassiko, to be seen. Ehipassiko means to come and see, for one to come and see, for oneself, through practice. Find out. It is not a matter of belief. So find out, regarding to Dharma teachings. You have heard that before, I am sure, if you have been practicing for a while. For a lot of people, that is the attraction of the Dharma over, say, other religions, that message. But what often happens for practitioners is we see something a few times - for example, that [[craving]] leads to [[Dukkha|suffering]], and we hear these teachings about [[desire]], et cetera, and something generalizes quite quickly, because it is a message we get a lot, and we actually stop questioning. We stop the breadth and the depth and the radicality of our questioning. We stop looking further. ^2-3
###### 3-1
And so, in a way, we kind of program our [[perception]], and we only see this. So I have asked sometimes a crowd, an audience, "Are you sure that [[desire]] leads to [[Dukkha|suffering]]?" And people just nod, "Yeah, absolutely, I am sure, because I have checked it out and everything." And it does not always lead to suffering, as I showed in the [[Beauty]] of Desire talks. But there can be this belief that we are finding out for ourself, not believing anything, but actually something gets a little stuck and we stop the ehipassiko, we stop the movement to come find out, to look further, to keep exploring. So what I want to say with all this, I really want to ask and encourage open-mindedness, exploration, practice, that kind of boldness, and experimentation, and playing, and willingness to investigate, to question. ^3-1
###### 3-2
[[Eros]], also, despite all these definitions and how unfamiliar it all might sound, et cetera, eros is already in [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]]. It already, I would say, is an element mixed in with any imaginal practice. I have said to people, "Notice the [[love]] with the imaginal figures." This is really important. Imaginal figures always involve love. Sometimes it is really not obvious at all. Sometimes it can look like the opposite. But there is love there, and there is many different kinds of love, many flavors, characters, expressions of love. This is to be noticed in imaginal practice. And it is both ways, the love is both ways. We will return to this. But wrapped up with the love, related to the love - not the same as, but related - is a kind of eros. It is not the same as sex, although there might be [[sexuality]] in the imaginal practice, but there is eros. When we talk, with [[Image|images]] and in relation to imaginal figures, about opening to them, feeling that you are somehow in service to this imaginal figure, or that you surrender to this yidam or deity or imaginal figure, these words - opening to, service, surrender - either lead to eros, they deepen the eros, or they already imply that eros is there in the relationship. Actually, I would say eros is inherent in imaginal relationship, the relationship with imaginal figures. So I am talking about something to notice, to see there. ^3-2
###### 3-3
[[Eros]] is not [[craving]]. We have said that. We mean different things by that. We will expand on that. But also in relation to more kind of conventional [[Dharma|Dharma teachings]], it is also the case that with a little experimentation you will discover that eros can lead, at times - or it can be steered to lead, definitely - to [[Samadhi|samādhi]], to quite deep states of samādhi. For a lot of people, this is really surprising, because they consider eros, [[sexuality]], that kind of thing, as distraction, as defilement. We have talked about this. But I have lost count of how many examples I could give, and I have talked about them on other [[Retreat|retreats]], et cetera, where some kind of very often unexpected or guided erotic interaction with an [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]] in the imaginal practice brings about samādhi and the person is surprised by that consequence, that samādhi comes out of this actually sexual - oftentimes it is very sexual, not even just erotic; it is actually really sexual. And very different kinds of sexuality - so some are very sort of soft and loving, and others darker versions or stronger versions, if you like; it may or may not even be your usual gender or sexual orientation, all that that you are used to identifying with. ^3-3
###### 3-4
Many possibilities. But [[Samadhi|samādhi]] can - I will return to these - but samādhi can often come out of this. So there is something that is a very standard [[Dharma]] concept coming out of something that looks like it does not have anything to do with it. And similarly, the [[Brahmaviharas|brahmavihāras]]; hopefully there will be time on this [[retreat]] to talk about the link and the relationship between [[eros]] and the brahmavihāras, but I think I gave at least one example in that series of talks, An Ecology of [[Love]], where actually quite a dark, lusty, and quite strange - or by most people's standards strange - kind of sexual [[image]] actually deepened and opened the flow of [[compassion]], the second brahmavihāra, very, very potently. So maybe we will return to that later, the relationship between eros and the brahmavihāras. ^3-4
###### 4-1
Continuing our sort of [[delineations]] here, standard [[Dharma]], et cetera, and [[eros]]. Eros, we have already said, is much more than [[sexuality]] and sexual [[energy]], attraction. We are not equating them. But it is, or it may be the case, let us put it that way, that exploring eros and the [[imaginal]] in practice, in [[meditation]], may bring with it or lead to an opening up of a level and a breadth of questioning regarding sexuality in general - one's own sexuality, and one's attitudes, et cetera. It may well just open up that whole field, and also the [[experience]] of sexual energies, too. So we will return to that. We will return to that later. ^4-1
###### 4-2
So just making a few more little [[delineations]]. I think I have said this before: I am not equating [[eros]] with [[love]]. So love is one of those poor words nowadays; it is come to have to mean so much, this poor word, to do so much work, to span so much territory. It is a lovely word, but oftentimes there is problems with just how much it has come to mean or include. There is too much for one word, so oftentimes people, two people, are using that same word in relation to each other, and saying it to each other, and they actually mean quite different things. What they are referring to entails different experiences for them, different [[Perception|perceptions]] of the other, different [[feelings]], different sense of obligations that come out of it - "I love you, therefore I am obliged to" what? Guarantees are different, the commitments are different. ^4-2
###### 4-3
But if we say, for now, if we use the word [[love]] to just mean something like care - care for someone's [[Pleasantness|well-being]] on every level - then it is clear, if we just look at some [[Delineations|distinctions]] now between different terms, it is clear, of course, that we can have sex, even pleasurable sex, enjoyable sex, without love and without [[eros]]. So I would say - hopefully there is some respect, at least, but sex is possible and for a lot of people maybe it is common without love or without eros. It is also possible that you can have sex with love, with care, but without eros. In other words, there is sexual arousal, sexual pleasure, et cetera, and care for this person - maybe sometimes even a lifetime of care in partnership - but actually this person is, or maybe never was, or is no longer - there is no longer a [[soulmaking]] in the sex. There is no longer the aliveness of the erotic and the [[imaginal]] in bed. So then there is sex with love, but without eros. And of course you can have love, care, without sex or eros. You can care deeply for someone with [[metta]], et cetera, but this other that I give my mettā to, wish well, et cetera, care deeply about their well-being, is not alive for me as a soulmaking [[image]]. They do not constitute that for my [[psyche]]. And if it is not clear by now - hopefully it is - we can have eros and an erotic connection with someone with or without sex or sexual contact. ^4-3
###### 4-4
So, all those permutations. But I would say it is not possible to have [[eros]] without [[love]]. So that is quite interesting. It is not possible to have eros without love because eros leads, brings, stimulates, opens a [[perception]] of - more and more so, in fact, as it goes on - the [[beauty]] and the [[divinity]]. More and more, as I said, this grows, the divinity of the object, of the erotic object. Eros opens the perception of beauty and divinity, and we can not help but love what appears to us deeply beautiful and divine. So I would say it is actually not possible to have eros, in the way that we are talking about it, without love. ^4-4
###### 4-5
[25:33] So implicit in all that we just said is that, in a way, [[eros]] is actually always involved with and involves the [[imaginal]], and [[psyche]], in the way that I used that word before. So where there is eros, the imaginal is instigated, invoked, inflamed, deepened, widened, et cetera, brought alive; psyche is expanded, enriched, deepened, complicated. And vice versa - where there is the imaginal, where that is operating, where something is an [[image]], eros already is inherently wrapped up in the relationship with that image. And also [[logos]], too; so there is an ideation, there is some kind of idea that is wrapped up with an erotic [[perception]] of someone or something. [[Conceptual Framework|Conceptuality]], logos, supports - to whatever extent it can - that eros. ^4-5
###### 4-6
I mentioned this [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]] as one of our list of things that we talked about. ^4-6
###### 4-7
I am going to talk much more about this. But what it means, as I said, is that the [[eros]] wanting more, it deepens and creates/discovers more to the [[image]], gives more [[imaginal]] [[Dimensionality|dimensions]], imaginal complexity, imaginal facets and faces to this beloved other, and in that, the idea, the [[logos]], also of this other expands. That [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos]], that soulmaking dynamic, then comes back because the object is more beautiful, more deep, more rich, more [[Juiciness|juicy]], more enticing, more complex. It offers me more, it offers more for the [[psyche]], so to speak, to move into, to expand, but also for the eros to find attractive and to want more of. So there is this way that it kind of just potentially infinitely, in a way, just expands. We are going to talk a lot more about that. There is this mutual insemination, mutual fertilization, growth, expansion, deepening, widening, complexifying, complicating, enrichening of eros-psyche-logos. They all help each other, if you like. They are all involved with and involve each other. That is the eros-psyche-logos dynamic. ^4-7
###### 5-1
The fact of that, as a fact of our [[soul]], of the way the soul works, implies several things. One is that - to say another way what we have already said - [[eros]] is liberating in different ways. So let us unpack that just a little bit now. When there is [[craving]] or [[clinging]] or greed or [[aversion]], in our [[Phenomenology|phenomenological]] approach we can see, when there is clinging towards something, or pushing away, craving, grasping, aversion, it tends to solidify the [[perception]] of that object that we are clinging to. So there is a solidification of that object, and also kind of stagnation, a stagnation of the perception: we only see it this one way. Or rather the perception gets more solid or more one way, often in a negative way, or a particular flatly enticing way. Now, we know all that from [[dependent origination]] and the study of that in practice through [[ways of looking]], et cetera. The reverse is also true, that when a certain perception is solidified, it tends to stimulate the clinging. So these two go together, the solidification and stagnation, if you like, of perception, and clinging. ^5-1
###### 5-2
To a certain extent, even when we see something as [[Impermanence|impermanent]] or flowing, there can still be a kind of stagnation of the [[perception]], a kind of one-[[dimensionality]], and a certain unidirectionality of the perception, so it is stagnated, this perception, in a certain way. Solidification and stagnation of perception are the exact opposites of what happens with this [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]], or they are, if you like, an arresting of that dynamic, of the eros-psyche-logos dynamic and the way that opens out the perception, the [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]], the sense of, the knowing of, the intimacy with, and the idea of the object, the erotic object. As I said, there is an infinite potential there for this mutual insemination, fertilization, expansion, enrichening, deepening, to [[Create-Discover|create/discover]] more of the [[beauty]], more of the dimensionality, more of, more faces of, more dimensions of this beloved, this erotic object. ^5-2
###### 5-3
So it is the opposite of stagnating or solidifying a [[perception]]. We are going to talk a lot about this, but that kind of infinite potential, just infinitely increasing, or expanding, or complexifying, or complicating, or enriching the object. There is much more to say about that, and it does not happen as a smooth process. It happens a) in stages and b) often with hiccups and obstacles that need to be addressed or negotiated or made aware of, et cetera. But what that means is that [[eros]], in its capacity to open perception and see also [[image]] as image, is very different than [[Craving|grasping]], [[aversion]], [[clinging]], craving. It has the opposite effect. It does not solidify, it does not stagnate. Actually it liberates the object. Its effect is to liberate the perception in a certain sense. ^5-3
###### 5-4
Last thing for now. I can not remember now if I have said it, but it may be dawning on you that - I did say it, did not I? - that there is a small definition of [[eros]], as we said, that eros is this wanting more contact, connection, intimacy, [[experience]], knowing, penetration, opening to of the erotic other, the [[imaginal]] erotic object, of something, and that is what we are calling the small definition. There is also, because of the way that [[psyche]], and [[logos]], and [[image]], and the imaginal, and [[soulmaking]], and that whole [[soulmaking dynamic]], the eros-psyche-logos dynamic, are actually implicated, or the natural tendency of what eros does - it will start to involve them, and it will start to expand, unless it is inhibited. We can also kind of talk about eros and imply all that, really imply that whole dynamic, that whole constellation, so that in the small definition we are really talking about eros as one element of that eros-psyche-logos, that soulmaking dynamic. Or sometimes when I use the word eros I will actually be using it in a way that implies that whole erotic imaginal constellation, implying that whole dynamic, that whole expansion of that dynamic, and everything that is involved in the erotic imaginal - aliveness, activation, that process, the way it constellates self-other-world, et cetera, which we will come back to. ^5-4
###### 6-1
So this is just one of those things. Again, I probably apologize in advance: I predict that I will be going back and forth between these two meanings, the more small meaning and sort of saying something like, "When [[eros]] gets blocked it becomes [[craving]]," or something like that, or "When the [[logos]] does not expand enough, then there is problems." But it should probably be pretty clear in that. Another implication there is that eros in itself, so to speak - the small definition - is neither inherently, intrinsically positive or negative, good or bad. It is just this wanting, as I said, more contact, more opening, more penetration, more intimacy, more [[experience]], more knowing of, all that, with the erotic object. So in itself, it is neither here nor there. Of course, there is no 'in itself.' We can not extricate it as something that does not stimulate this whole movement of [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos]], this whole dynamic, interwoven dynamic, or as something that is trying to stimulate that dynamic but is blocked in different ways. So there really is no 'in itself.' Whether eros is fertilizing for the [[soul]], is [[soulmaking]], is enriching, is beautiful, is opening and opening up the sense of existence or not, and therefore desirable or not, is really dependent on what happens in relationship to that whole dynamic, or how that whole dynamic is able to unfold. We will talk a lot about this. ^6-1
###### 6-2
So in itself, it is neither. If there is an 'in itself,' [[eros]] is neither actually good or bad, positive or negative. It is just this thing. But oftentimes we will be talking in the bigger definition, bigger implication. When a [[realism]] comes in and I really do not see this [[image]] as an image, I really take it as literal or a truth, or this idea that is wrapped up in the [[imaginal]] and the erotic object, and I take that [[logos]] as really being true, then problems come in and eros becomes [[craving]]. When there is realism, eros leads to craving, related to what I said before about the solidification, et cetera. We will come back to this. There are other kind of problems that can come in - there can be a cramping, or a blocking, or a limiting in different ways, either of the eros, of the libido if you like, or of the [[psyche]], of the imaginal function, or of the logos. So when any of these elements is cramped, blocked, limited, then it gives rise to problems in the relationship with the other, with the erotic object. We are going to look at this in much more detail as we go on. Okay. ^6-2
