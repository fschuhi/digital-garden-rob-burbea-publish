[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4]]

###### 1-1
Now, I'm aware that these - well, many of these, at least - are quite unfamiliar ideas for many people, maybe even many [[Dharma]] people, and maybe in the culture. So I want to just say something about that. It's a lot easier to teach <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dharma</a></span>, or rather there's no _objection_, which makes it easier when we teach <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dharma</a></span> or present something as <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dharma</a></span>, in the cases where we mix in all kinds of assumptions, or frames of reference, or conceptual bases, or conceptual biases as well, as long as they're well-established in Western modernist culture and assumed to be true by that culture. So when you mix those kind of ideas in and assumptions in, and package it all as (quote) '<span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dharma</a></span>' - for instance, [[neuroscience]] or some of the ideas from modern psychotherapy - and you introduce them, and they become absorbed or blended into (quote) '<span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dharma</a></span>,' that's a lot easier. Rarely does anyone's eyebrows get raised or anyone have a problem with that[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Nobody has a problem with a "Dharma" which mixes in established Western ideas from science or psychotherapy|.]] ^1-1
###### 1-2
When one tries to introduce or open up more unfamiliar ideas, ideas that are not popular or populist in the culture, that's more difficult. And more than that, when one, if you like, adds something, so to speak, 'foreign' or new to what we might call '[[Dharma]],' when it's foreign or new, that addition is much more conspicuous as an addition than when they're sort of ideas that people are familiar with from their culture. It's still happening; it's still an addition. There is still an addition, even when it's not obvious when we add ideas about [[neuroscience]], or modern psychotherapy ideas, or whatever. It's still happening, nevertheless. Something is being added. It's just not so _obvious_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Unpopular or especially foreign ideas are much conspicuous as an addition|.]] ^1-2
###### 1-3
Add to that this other idea, that the ideas we are using are not truth claims, they don't refer to realities, and _that_ is very difficult sometimes for people to get their heads around, as well, because we're used to hearing, "It's like this," or "It's like that," or thinking that [[Dharma]] concepts refer to realities, etc. Certainly when we think about [[neuroscience]] or modern psychotherapy ideas, almost always, almost without exception, there's the assumption and the message that these are realities. So it's quite difficult sometimes to hear something or to try and present something as, "These ideas don't have truth claims in the way that we usually operate with truth claims and truth assumptions.[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Operating without truth claims is difficult for people to wrap their head around|"]] ^1-3
###### 1-4
So, unfamiliar. I'm aware of that, and I'm certainly aware of the difficulties in trying to present all this. But still, I insist, absolutely insist, that in our [[Dharma]] - in other words, in _your_ <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dharma</a></span>, in _your_ practice, and in _your_ life - [[fantasy]] and [[image]] is already involved. It's already involved in <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dharma</a></span>, in practice, and life. I absolutely insist on that. And I also insist that this is not a bad thing. Not at all a bad thing. It's inevitable, and it's important, and it may well, I would say, be necessary. It's certainly necessary to galvanize in relation to practice and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dharma</a></span>, and to be inspired in life, and to have [[meaningfulness]]. All that's necessary. So it's not a bad thing. We need to recognize both the general fact that it's operating, and also the particular ways that it's operating for us, that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fantasy" href="fantasy" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fantasy</a></span> and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="image" href="image" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image</a></span> operate for us, and the kinds and directions in which <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fantasy" href="fantasy" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fantasy</a></span> and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="image" href="image" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image</a></span> operate, and mix in with our life, and impel our life. We need a double level of recognition: general, and a more individual, particular[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#In any Dharma fantasy and image is already involved|.]] ^1-4
###### 1-5
Out of that, we need to kind of expand a psychology that can talk about that and include all that, recognize it and be sensitive to it and be wise in relationship to it, instead of just not admitting it, not seeing it, or trying to cut it because it's _[[Papanca|papañca]]_. We need to include, then, in this psychology, in this [[conceptual framework]], we need to include ideas such as [[soulmaking]] or [[eros]] that are not yet articulated in what we call '[[Dharma]].' To me, that seems a necessity, you know, something that's called for. When we look at our life and the movements of our life with a psychology that's too simplistic, it doesn't serve us. It doesn't serve the totality of our being[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#We need to include ideas such as soulmaking or eros|.]] ^1-5
###### 2-1
A person says, "Well, that's just _[[Vedana|vedanā]]_ leading." So when you talk about [[eros]] or that kind of thing, "That's just _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" href="Vedana" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vedanā</a></span>_ leading. You're just chasing the pleasant or running away from the unpleasant," or "That's just _[[Papanca|papañca]]_," when we talk about the [[imaginal]] or [[fantasy]]; what motivates us is either this movement governed by _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" href="Vedana" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vedanā</a></span>_ towards pleasant and unpleasant, or some people teach that basically we get attached to things like views because we're trying to shore up this self that somehow, deep down, we know is not real - therefore we attach, we [[Clinging|cling]] to this and this, to try and shore up my views and my [[Habit|habits]] and all that. But that kind of psychology, this self shoring up, or the _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" href="Vedana" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vedanā</a></span>_ leading, that _that's_ what's going on, or it's just _[[Metta|mettā]]_ - I've touched on this before - this is, in a way, not sophisticated enough. It's a little bit poor as a psychology. Valuable as it is (we've talked about this), we need something richer, deeper, wider: a psychology that can accommodate and [[Delineations|delineate]] between the kinds of things that we're talking about[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#"It's just vedana papanca" is a little bit poor as a psychology|.]] ^2-1
###### 2-2
From our perspective, the movement to seek to increase pleasure or decrease unpleasant sensations, when that is the prime intention of a movement of [[Embodiment|body]] or [[mind]], when that's the prime driver, to maximize or increase pleasant sensations and decrease unpleasant ones, when that's the prime driver, and there isn't this richness of what we call [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]], then that is axiomatically (in the way that _we're_ talking about it) not [[soulmaking]]. That's not creating [[Soul|soulfulness]]. It will not do that. It's not [[eros]]. It's what we might call [[craving]], as I said. But to think too much that way, or to really regard as if that's the thing that mostly moves us as human beings, it's a really, really poor psychology. But it's interesting. This kind of need to expand the psychology a little bit and enrich the psychology a little bit, it's not just in the [[Dharma]] transmission, in the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dharma circles</a></span>. It's in the wider culture too[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Craving is not soulmaking|.]] ^2-2

I had an oncologist until recently, and he prescribed me the standard course of chemotherapy for my condition, but I think he basically thought it wouldn't work, because of the disease I had, and the stage it was at and all that. It wouldn't work, so there was no point trying to do any more chemotherapy. Plus, it was also potentially dangerous, and it wasn't a risk that he was prepared to take for different reasons - that it might do more harm than good, I think is what he thought. But in trying to persuade me to sort of give up wanting to experiment a little bit with longer and more chemotherapy, etc., he would often say something like, "It's about quality of life. Come off the chemo, and just enjoy the duration of the rest of your life with a better quality of life.[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Story oncologist "quality of life"|"]] ^2-3
###### 2-4
He would often say this, and I often had the feeling that he and I understood very different things about what constituted a good quality of life. But then he would also often say "quality of life," and then say a bit more, and often he would say, "go on holiday." He would often say that as part of his sort of package of what 'quality of life' meant, and what I could do if I was off chemo, as I could go on holiday. That is probably partly reflecting just - as an NHS oncologist, he was probably grossly overworked and overstretched, and probably was desperately needing a break and [[craving]] a holiday. But he didn't say, "Quality of life, so you can go on pilgrimage." A medieval peasant in Christendom, or Tibetan Buddhists even nowadays, or a Muslim nowadays, if they were told, "You probably only have some months to live," one of the responses might be, from the doctor saying that, "You know, take the time off the medication. You might be able to make a pilgrimage.[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#"Go on holiday" - but why not on pilgrimage|"]] ^2-4
###### 3-1
Very different mindset. What's the difference? Well, one typically - I mean, this isn't black and white, but - one [[Desire|desires]] or seeks a reduction in stress, an increase in pleasure, perhaps seeking out novel or exciting experiences, whereas the pilgrimage, in contrast to holiday, pilgrimage is a movement of [[soulmaking]], an actual movement that is <span class="transcript"><a data-href="soulmaking" href="soulmaking" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soulmaking</a></span>; an [[embodiment]] of [[eros]], s omething we do with our bodies that is an erotic movement that brings <span class="transcript"><a data-href="soulmaking" href="soulmaking" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soulmaking</a></span>. It's interesting. Different cultures, ancient and contemporary, religious and secular, tend to assume a universality of wants - that people want this or that, or most people want this. In the modern secular West, the choice we have of what we seek is actually wider, and perhaps wider than at any point in the whole [[history]] of humanity. That's one of the things that actually characterizes [[modernism]] - well, secularity, particularly, and also consumerism. So the choice is wider. And also individuality has a certain premium in modern secular [[Dominant Culture|Western culture]], so it's acknowledged that the individual, the person, has a choice that needs to be respected, to a certain extent, in what's important to them. But still, there's usually a presumption that most people will conform to what's, we could say, popular, secular values, and that what you'll want is a holiday, as opposed to something like a pilgrimage[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Cultures tend to assume a universality of wants|.]] ^3-1
###### 3-2
With all this, and all this talk about [[eros]] and exploration of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span>, I really want to emphasize again something you've heard in relation to the [[Dharma]] before, I'm sure. Don't _believe_; these teachings, the [[Buddha]] said, are _ehipassiko, to be _seen_. _Ehipassiko_ means 'to come and see,' for one to come and see, for oneself, through practice. Find out. It's not a matter of belief. Find out, regarding to <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dharma teachings</a></span>. You've heard that before, I'm sure, if you've been practising for a while. For a lot of people, that's the attraction of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dharma</a></span> over, say, other religions, that message. But what often happens for practitioners is we see something a few times - for example, that [[craving]] leads to [[Dukkha|suffering]] - and we hear these teachings about [[desire]], etc., and something generalizes quite quickly, because it's a message we get a lot, and we actually stop questioning. We stop the breadth and the depth and the radicality of our questioning. We stop looking further._ ^3-2
###### 3-3
And so, in a way, we kind of program our [[perception]], and we only see _this_. So I've asked sometimes a crowd, an audience, "Are you sure that [[desire]] leads to [[Dukkha|suffering]]?" And people just nod, "Yeah, absolutely, I'm sure, because I've checked it out and everything." And it _doesn't_ always lead to <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span>, as I showed in the "[[Beauty]] of [[Desire]]" talks.^[Rob Burbea, "The Beauty of Desire" [Parts 1 and 2] (19 and 26 Nov. 2011), [https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=beauty+of+desire](https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=beauty+of+desire)] But there can be this belief that we're finding out for ourself, not believing anything, but actually something gets a little stuck, and we stop the _ehipassiko_. We stop the movement to come find out, to look further, to keep exploring. What I want to say with all this, I really want to ask and encourage open-mindedness, exploration, practice, that kind of boldness and experimentation, and playing, and willingness to investigate, to question[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#We stop the movement to come find out|.]] ^3-3
###### 3-4
[[Eros]], also, despite all these definitions and how unfamiliar it all might sound, etc., [[eros]] is already in [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]]. It already, I would say, is an element mixed in with any <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" href="Imaginal" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imaginal practice</a></span>. I've said to people, "Notice the [[love]] with the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" href="Imaginal" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imaginal figures</a></span>." This is really important. <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" href="Imaginal" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Imaginal figures</a></span> always involve <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">love</a></span>. Sometimes it's really not obvious at all. Sometimes it can _look_ like the opposite, but there is <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">love</a></span> there. And there are many different kinds of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">love</a></span>, many flavours, characters, expressions of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">love</a></span>. This is to be noticed in <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" href="Imaginal" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imaginal practice</a></span>. And it's both ways. The <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">love</a></span> is both ways. We'll return to this. But wrapped up with the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">love</a></span>, related to the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">love</a></span> - not the same as, but related - is a kind of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span>. It's not the same as sex, although there might be [[sexuality]] in the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" href="Imaginal" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imaginal practice</a></span>, but there's <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span>. When we talk, with [[Image|images]] and in relation to <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" href="Imaginal" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imaginal figures</a></span>, about opening to them, about feeling that you are somehow in service to this <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" href="Imaginal" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imaginal figure</a></span>, or that you surrender to this _yidam_ or deity or <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" href="Imaginal" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imaginal figure</a></span>, these words (opening to, service, surrender) either lead to <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span>, they deepen the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span>, or they already imply that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span> is there in the relationship. Actually, I would say <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span> is inherent in [[imaginal]] relationship, the relationship with <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" href="Imaginal" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imaginal figures</a></span>. I'm talking about something to notice, to see there[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros is already in imaginal practice because imaginal figures always involve love|.]] ^3-4
###### 4-1
[[Eros]] is not [[craving]]. We've said that. We mean different things by that. We'll expand on that. But also in relation to more kind of conventional [[Dharma|Dharma teachings]], it's also the case that, with a little experimentation, you will discover that [[eros]] _can_ lead, at times - or it can be steered to lead, definitely - to _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_, to quite deep states of _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" href="Samadhi" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">samādhi</a></span>_. For a lot of people, this is really surprising, because they consider <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span>, [[sexuality]], that kind of thing, as distraction, as defilement. We've talked about this. But I've lost count of how many examples I could give, and I've talked about them on other [[Retreat|retreats]], etc., where some kind of often very unexpected or guided erotic interaction with an [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]] in the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" href="Imaginal" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imaginal practice</a></span> brings about _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" href="Samadhi" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">samādhi</a></span>,_ and the person is surprised by that consequence, that _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" href="Samadhi" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">samādhi</a></span>_ comes out of this actually sexual [interaction]. Oftentimes it's very sexual, not even just erotic; it's actually really sexual. And very different kinds of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="sexuality" href="sexuality" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexuality</a></span>. Some are very sort of soft and loving, and others darker versions or stronger versions, if you like. It may or may not even be your usual gender or sexual orientation, all that that you're used to identifying with[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros can be steered to lead to samadhi|.]] ^4-1
###### 4-2
Many possibilities. I'll return to these. But _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ can often come out of this. So there's something that's a very standard [[Dharma]] concept coming out of something that looks like it doesn't have anything to do with it. And similarly, the _[[Brahmaviharas|brahmavihāras]]_. Hopefully there will be time on this [[retreat]] to talk about the link and the relationship between [[eros]] and the _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brahmavihāras</a></span>_, but I think I gave at least one example in that series of talks, _An Ecology of [[Love]]_, where actually quite a dark, lusty, and quite strange (or by most people's standards, strange) kind of sexual [[image]] actually deepened and opened the flow of [[compassion]], the second _brahmavihāra_, very, very potently. Maybe we'll return to that later, the relationship between <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span> and the _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brahmavihāras</a></span>_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros has a potent relationship with the brahmaviharas|.]] ^4-2
###### 4-3
Continuing our sort of [[delineations]] here, and standard [[Dharma]], etc., and [[eros]]. [[Eros]], we've already said, is much more than [[sexuality]] and sexual [[energy]], attraction. We're not equating them. But it is, or it _may_ be the case, let's put it that way, that exploring <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span> and the [[imaginal]] in practice, in [[meditation]], may bring with it or lead to an opening up of a level and a breadth of questioning regarding <span class="transcript"><a data-href="sexuality" href="sexuality" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexuality</a></span> in general - one's own <span class="transcript"><a data-href="sexuality" href="sexuality" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sexuality</a></span>, and one's attitudes, etc. It may well just open up that whole field, and also the [[experience]] of sexual energies too. We'll return to that later[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros is much more than sexuality but can lead to opening up to questions about it|.]] ^4-3
###### 4-4
Just making a few more little [[delineations]]. I think I've said this before: I'm not equating [[eros]] with [[love]]. '[[Love]]' is one of those poor words nowadays; it's come to have to mean so much, this poor word, to do so much work, to span so much territory, and we still use it. It's a lovely word! [laughs] But oftentimes there are problems with just how much it has come to mean or include. There's too much for one word. Oftentimes people, two people, are using that same word in relation to each other, and saying it to each other, and they actually mean quite different things. What they're referring to entails different experiences for them, different [[Perception|perceptions]] of the other, different [[feelings]], different sense of obligations that come out of it: "I <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">love</a></span> you, therefore I am obliged" _what_ ? Guarantees are different. The commitments are different[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#I'm not equating eros with love|.]] ^4-4
###### 5-1
But if we say, for now, if we use the word '[[love]]' to just mean something like care, care for someone's [[Pleasantness|well-being]] on every level, then it's clear, if we just look at some [[Delineations|distinctions]] now between different terms, it's clear, of course, that we can have sex, even pleasurable sex, enjoyable sex, without <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">love</a></span> and without [[eros]]. I would say - hopefully there's some respect, at least, but sex is possible, and for a lot of people maybe it's common without <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">love</a></span> or without <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span>. It's also possible that you can have sex with <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">love</a></span>, with care, but without <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span>. In other words, there's sexual arousal, sexual pleasure, etc., and care for this person, maybe sometimes even a lifetime of care in partnership, but actually this person is, or maybe never was, or is no longer - there's no longer a [[soulmaking]] in the sex. There's no longer the aliveness of the erotic and the [[imaginal]] in bed. So then there's sex with <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">love</a></span>, but without <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span>. And of course you can have <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">love</a></span>, care, without sex or <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span>. You can care deeply for someone with _[[Metta|mettā]]_, etc., but this other that I give my _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" href="Metta" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mettā</a></span>_ to, wish well, etc., care deeply about their <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-being</a></span>, is not alive for me as a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="soulmaking" href="soulmaking" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soulmaking</a></span> [[image]]. They don't constitute that for my [[psyche]]. And if it's not clear by now (hopefully it is), we can have <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span> and an erotic connection with someone with or without sex or sexual contact[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Sex is possible with and without love care eros|.]] ^5-1

So, all those permutations. But I would say it's _not_ possible to have [[eros]] without [[love]]. That's quite interesting. It's not possible to have <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span> without <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">love</a></span>, because <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span> leads, brings, stimulates, opens a [[perception]] of - more and more so, in fact, as it goes on - a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perception</a></span> of the [[beauty]] and the [[divinity]]. More and more, as I said, this grows, the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="divinity" href="divinity" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divinity</a></span> of the object, of the erotic object. [[Eros]] opens the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perception</a></span> of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="beauty" href="beauty" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beauty</a></span> and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="divinity" href="divinity" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divinity</a></span>, and we can't help but <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">love</a></span> what appears to us deeply beautiful and divine. So I would say it's actually not possible to have <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span>, in the way that _we're_ talking about it, without <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">love</a></span>[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#But it's not possible to have eros without love|.]] ^5-2

Implicit in all that we just said is that, in a way, [[eros]] is actually _always_ involved with and involves the [[imaginal]] and [[psyche]], in the way that I used that word before. Where there's <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span>, the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="imaginal" href="imaginal" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imaginal</a></span> is instigated, invoked, inflamed, deepened, widened, etc., brought alive. [[Psyche]] is expanded, enriched, deepened, complicated. And vice versa: where there's the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="imaginal" href="imaginal" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imaginal</a></span>, where that's operating, where something is an [[image]], <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span> already is inherently wrapped up in the relationship with that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="image" href="image" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image</a></span>. And also [[logos]] too. There's an ideation. There's some kind of idea that's wrapped up with an erotic [[perception]] of someone or something. [[Conceptual Framework|Conceptuality]], <span class="transcript"><a data-href="logos" href="logos" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logos</a></span>, supports - to whatever extent it can - it supports that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span>[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros is always involved with psyche and logos|.]] ^5-3
###### 5-4
I mentioned this [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]] as one of our list of things that we talked about. I'm going to talk much more about this. But what it means, as I said, is that the [[eros]], wanting more, it deepens and creates/discovers more to the [[image]], gives more [[imaginal]] [[Dimensionality|dimensions]], <span class="transcript"><a data-href="imaginal" href="imaginal" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imaginal</a></span> complexity, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="imaginal" href="imaginal" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imaginal</a></span> facets and faces to this beloved other, and in that, the idea, the [[logos]], also, of this other expands. That <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking Dynamic" data-href="Soulmaking Dynamic" href="Soulmaking+Dynamic" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros-psyche-logos</a></span>, that [[soulmaking dynamic]], then comes back, because the object then is more beautiful, more deep, more rich, more [[Juiciness|juicy]], more enticing, more complex. It offers me more. It offers more for the [[psyche]], so to speak, to move into, to expand, but also for the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span> to find attractive and to want more of. So there's this way that it kind of, potentially infinitely, in a way, just expands. We're going to talk a lot more about that. There's this mutual insemination, mutual fertilization, growth, expansion, deepening, widening, complexifying, complicating, enrichening of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking Dynamic" data-href="Soulmaking Dynamic" href="Soulmaking+Dynamic" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros-psyche-logos</a></span>. They all help each other, if you like. They're all involved with and involve each other. That's the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking Dynamic" data-href="Soulmaking Dynamic" href="Soulmaking+Dynamic" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros-psyche-logos dynamic</a></span>[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros psyche logos they all help each other|.]] ^5-4
###### 6-1
The fact of that, as a fact of our [[soul]], of the way the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="soul" href="soul" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soul</a></span> works, implies several things. One is that - to say another way what we've already said - [[eros]] is liberating in different ways. Let's unpack that just a little bit now. When there is [[craving]] or [[clinging]] or greed or [[aversion]], in our [[Phenomenology|phenomenological]] approach, we can see, when there's <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clinging</a></span> towards something, or [[Aversion|pushing away]], or <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">craving</a></span>, [[Craving|grasping]], <span class="transcript"><a data-href="aversion" href="aversion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aversion</a></span>, it tends to solidify the [[perception]] of that object that we're <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clinging</a></span> to. There's a solidification of that object, and also a kind of stagnation, a stagnation of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perception</a></span>: we only see it this one way. Or rather, the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perception</a></span> gets _more_ solid, or _more_ one way, often in a negative way, or a particular flatly enticing way. Now, we know all that from [[dependent origination]], and the study of that in practice, through [[ways of looking]], etc. The reverse is also true, that when a certain <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perception</a></span> is solidified, it tends to stimulate the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clinging</a></span>. So these two go together, the solidification and stagnation, if you like, of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perception</a></span>, and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clinging</a></span>[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Clinging leads to a solidification and stagnation of perception and vice versa|.]] ^6-1
###### 6-2
To a certain extent, even when we see something as [[Impermanence|impermanent]] or flowing, there can still be a kind of stagnation of the [[perception]], a kind of one-[[dimensionality]], and a certain unidirectionality of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perception</a></span>. It's stagnated, this <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perception</a></span>, in a certain way. The solidification and stagnation of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perception</a></span> are the exact opposites of what happens with this [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]], or they're, if you like, an arresting of that dynamic, of the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking Dynamic" data-href="Soulmaking Dynamic" href="Soulmaking+Dynamic" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros-psyche-logos dynamic</a></span> and the way that opens out the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perception</a></span>, the [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]], the sense of, the knowing of, the intimacy with, and the idea of the object, the erotic object. As I said, there's an infinite potential there for this mutual insemination, fertilization, expansion, enrichening, deepening, to [[Create-Discover|create/discover]] more of the [[beauty]], more of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="dimensionality" href="dimensionality" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dimensionality</a></span>, more of, more faces of, more [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] of this beloved, this erotic object[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#The soulmaking dynamic opens out the perception|.]] ^6-2
###### 6-3
So it's the opposite of stagnating or solidifying the [[perception]]. We're going to talk a lot about this, but that kind of infinite potential, just infinitely increasing, or expanding, or complexifying, or complicating, or enriching the object. There's much more to say about that, and it certainly doesn't happen as a smooth process. It happens (A) in stages, and (B) often with hiccups and obstacles that need to be addressed or negotiated or made aware of, etc. But what that means is that [[eros]], in its capacity to open <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perception</a></span> and see also [[image]] as <span class="transcript"><a data-href="image" href="image" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image</a></span>, is very different than [[Craving|grasping]], [[aversion]], [[clinging]], [[craving]]. It has the opposite effect. It doesn't solidify. It doesn't stagnate. Actually, it _liberates_ the object. Its effect is to liberate the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perception</a></span>, in a certain sense[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Soulmaking is thus the opposite of stagnating or solidifying the perception it liberates it|.]] ^6-3
###### 6-4
Last thing for now. I can't remember now if I've said it, but it may be dawning on you that - I did say it, didn't I? - that there's a small definition of [[eros]], as we said, that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span> is this wanting more contact, connection, intimacy, [[experience]], knowing, penetration, opening to of the erotic other, the [[Imaginal|erotic-imaginal object]], of something, and that's what we're [[Passion|calling]] the small definition. There's also, because of the way that [[psyche]], and [[logos]], and [[image]], and the [[imaginal]], and [[soulmaking]], and that whole [[soulmaking dynamic]], the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]], are actually implicated, or the natural tendency of what <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span> does - it _will_ start to involve them, and it _will_ start to expand, unless it's inhibited. We can also kind of talk about <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span> and imply all that, really imply that whole dynamic, that whole constellation, so that in the small definition we're really talking about <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span> as one element of that <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking Dynamic" data-href="Soulmaking Dynamic" href="Soulmaking+Dynamic" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros-psyche-logos</a></span>, that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" href="soulmaking+dynamic" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soulmaking dynamic</a></span>. Or sometimes when I use the word '<span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span>' I'll actually be using it in a way that implies that whole erotic-<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" href="Imaginal" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imaginal constellation</a></span>, implying that whole dynamic, that whole expansion of that dynamic, and everything that's involved in the erotic-<span class="transcript"><a data-href="imaginal" href="imaginal" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imaginal</a></span> - aliveness, activation, that process, the way it constellates [[The Self|self, other, world]], etc., which we'll come back to[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#"Eros" can imply this whole dynamic "big definition"|.]] ^6-4
###### 7-1
This is just one of those things. Again, I probably apologize in advance: I predict that I'll be going back and forth between these two meanings, the more small meaning, and sort of saying something like, "When [[eros]] gets blocked it becomes [[craving]]," or something like that, or "When the [[logos]] doesn't expand enough, then there are problems." But it should probably be pretty clear in that. Another implication there is that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span> in itself, so to speak - the small definition - is neither inherently, intrinsically positive or negative, good or bad. It's just this wanting, as I said, more contact, more opening, more penetration, more intimacy, more [[experience]], more knowing of, all that, with the erotic object. So in itself, it's neither here nor there. Of course, there _is_ no 'in itself.' We can't extricate it as something that _doesn't_ stimulate this whole movement of [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos]], this whole dynamic, interwoven dynamic, or as something that is trying to stimulate that dynamic but is blocked in different ways. So there really is no 'in itself.' Whether <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span> is fertilizing for the [[soul]], is [[soulmaking]], is enriching, is beautiful, is opening and opening up the sense of existence or not, and therefore desirable or not, is really dependent on what happens in relationship to that whole dynamic, or how that whole dynamic is able to unfold. We'll talk a lot about this[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros is neither inherently positive or negative|.]] ^7-1
###### 7-2
So in itself, it's neither. If there is an 'in itself,' [[eros]] is neither actually good or bad, positive or negative. It's just this thing. But oftentimes we'll be talking in the bigger definition, bigger implication. When a [[realism]] comes in, and I really don't see this [[image]] as an <span class="transcript"><a data-href="image" href="image" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image</a></span>, I really take it as literal or a truth, or this idea that's wrapped up in the [[imaginal]] and the erotic object, and I take that [[logos]] as really being true, then problems come in, and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span> becomes [[craving]]. When there's <span class="transcript"><a data-href="realism" href="realism" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">realism</a></span>, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span> leads to <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">craving</a></span>, related to what I said before about the solidification, etc. We'll come back to this. There are other kind of problems that can come in. There can be a cramping, or a blocking, or a limiting in different ways, either of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eros</a></span>, of the libido, if you like, or of the [[psyche]], of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="imaginal" href="imaginal" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imaginal</a></span> function, or of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="logos" href="logos" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logos</a></span>. So when any of these elements is cramped, blocked, limited, then it gives rise to problems in the relationship with the other, with the erotic object. We're going to look at this in much more detail as we go on[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros becomes craving when psyche or logos are taken as really being true|.]] ^7-2
