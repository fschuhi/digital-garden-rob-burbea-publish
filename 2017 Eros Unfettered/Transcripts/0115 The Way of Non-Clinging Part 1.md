What I would like to do tonight is give a talk that in some ways could just stand alone, talking about [[Clinging|non-clinging]]. But in other ways, and this is my main purpose really, hopefully give something in a way that serves or gives a kind of preface, if you like, to the set of talks that we are going to start around the [[Alchemy|alchemy of desire]], around [[eros]] and practice. So kind of preface, but slightly strange preface, but one that serves to give a context, or at least part of a context for what many would probably consider relatively unusual teachings in the rest of the set. So I want to give part of a context tonight. And as well as context, begin also to contrast different, if you like, [[Insight|understandings]] or visions or [[Conceptual Framework|conceptual frameworks]] that we can have of [[Dharma]] and of this teaching of clinging and non-clinging in the Dharma[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Could be a standalone talk on clinging but will set context|.]] ^1-1
###### 1-2
That is the main point, to begin to contrast something. Because we can take away from listening to teachings or reading teachings or even be given through teachings an [[Insight|understanding]] or a [[conceptual framework]] of what the [[Dharma]] is that shapes our practice and shapes our whole sense of what the Dharma is, what the project is, what [[awakening]] is, what we are moving towards and what is involved, an understanding, conceptual framework, that is certainly helpful to a degree for many people, and certainly freeing to a certain extent, again, for many people, but that also shuts doors. This is the contrast I want to make, between different understandings, different conceptual frameworks, one of which, if you like, or a group of which I would say - helpful as it is, freeing as it is to a certain extent - also ends up shutting doors, doors that, if you like, open to a much wider and much more radical [[freedom]] and [[beauty]] and openness of being and of the sense of existence[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Different conceptual frameworks different understandings|.]] ^1-2
###### 1-3
So part of a context, begin to contrast some different large-scale [[Insight|understandings]] and where they might lead or what they might block off. Actually, I think I have pretty much talked about all of this before, and certainly written about much of it, and I do not particularly like to repeat myself, I do not see the point if it is already out there generally, would rather move on to new stuff. So a lot of this will be quite brief. It is also - not all of this, but much of it is - widely available. There is probably not a [[Meditation|Dharma teacher]] alive, and certainly not an insight meditation teacher, who does not talk about [[clinging]] certainly at one of the levels that I want to talk about. So some of it will be moving through territory quite briefly for those reasons, but I do want to draw out a couple of things, a couple of main points that I have maybe only mentioned before here and there, important as they are, again for the sake of context and for the sake of contrast[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#You've probably heard the teachings about non-clinging before|.]] ^1-3
###### 1-4
When we look in the [[Pali Canon]], the collected teachings, the early teachings of the [[Buddha]], the historical Buddha, we find a lot of different words, like English, a lot of different words - like English, we have [[passion]], [[desire]], [[craving]], greed, [[clinging]], grasping. Many words. English is a very rich language. And similarly in Pali, in the language of the Buddha, we have a word like raga, which actually is meaning to color or to dye. The coloring, like especially rouge, it is related to the word red, to make rouge. But it really means passion, excitement. Later on we will emphasize this, the passion colors something. When we color things red, we become impassioned or passion also colors things, so there is a link there. But there is this word raga, usually translated as passion or lust. [[Hindrances|Kama]] can have two meanings. One is the object of sensual [[Pleasantness|enjoyment]]. The object, so something that is sensually pleasing. But also sense desire. The verb kameti means to desire or to crave. There is the word lobha which can be translated as greed. Gedha, also translated as greed[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#A lot of English and Pali words for clinging desire greed etc|.]] ^1-4
###### 1-5
There is a word [[chanda]], which is an interesting word, because sometimes you can talk about chanda, for example, in Pali, called [[Hindrances|hitacchanda]], the effort to do good. Hita is what is useful or suitable or beneficial or friendly. So when we talk, for example, in [[metta]] practice about well-wishing or doing good in the world, it is hitacchanda. Chanda is really impulse or intention or will. It could be virtuous. It could be a virtue or a vice. The motivation to accomplish. It means all that. It can also mean excitement, related to impulse there. So sometimes people want to make a distinction: chanda is positive because it is good intention, or it can be good, and words like [[Clinging|raga]], kama, lobha, et cetera, these are negative words, they lead to [[Dukkha|suffering]], they are unskillful, et cetera[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Chanda is impulse intention will|.]] ^1-5
###### 2-1
However, there are also plenty of instances in the [[Pali Canon]] where, for instance, [[Sariputta]] in the Samyutta Nikaya says, "[[Hindrances|Chandaraga]], [[desire]] and lust, these are [[fetters]]." Okay? So [[chanda]] there is not qualified; he is just saying it is a fetter. There is words like [[Craving|tanha]], which is usually translated as craving, and [[Clinging|upadana]], clinging, usually translated, or attachment. This is quite an interesting word because it also means literally a fuel or that which supports something. So it can be grasping, holding on, clinging, as something that supports. And what does it support? It supports [[Dukkha|suffering]]. But as we go deeper, we will see that it supports a whole lot more than that. Supports the [[The Self|sense of self]], supports the very sense of reality, supports [[perception]], too, supports any [[experience]]. It is fuel for experience. This is taking the whole thing to another level. We will come back to this[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Clinging supports suffering|.]] ^2-1
###### 2-2
But there are all these words in Pali, and in the [[Pali Canon]], one way or another, the [[Buddha]] says [[Dharma|the path]] leads to the end of, and he uses any of these words, any of them. So in a way, they are kind of used interchangeably. We can certainly make [[Delineations|distinctions]] and try and carve out distinctions there, but generally, although there are distinctions, generally they are pretty much interchangeable. And the Buddha and the teachings say they are all [[fetters]] - [[Hindrances|kama]], [[Craving|tanha]], gedha, [[Clinging|raga]], lobha, [[passion]], lust, craving, [[desire]], et cetera, clinging. All fetters, samyojanani, which means fetter, like yoke, like an oxen that is plowing a field has a yoke to pull that on, something that imprisons. And the Buddha talks about different fetters and in the process, in the stages of [[Awakening|enlightenment]], how different fetters are eradicated is really the word that he uses. So kamacchanda, sensual desire, is eradicated at the third stage of awakening, and at full awakening, full enlightenment, arahantship, the raga, ruparaga, or the passion or the lust for material existence, for material [[birth]], for forms, if you prefer more experientially, getting away from the whole teaching of [[rebirth]] and all that, the passion, the lust for material forms. And aruparaga, the passion and lust for immaterial realms or immaterial [[jhanas]], or if you do the whole rebirth thing, rebirth in a formless realm. And also eradicated at arahantship is uddhacca, which is an interesting word - restlessness, agitation, excitement, flurry, imbalance, shakiness in the sense of being shaken by [[experience]]; it is the opposite of being subdued. It is also related to the word lifting up, uddhata, to lift up, to rise high, to be risen. So that, too, being able to be lifted up, being able to be excited, out of balance, in a flurry, not being subdued. What is the opposite of subdued in English? That is restlessness, sometimes, usually translated as uddhacca, that is also eradicated[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Fetters and arahantship|.]] ^2-2
###### 2-3
As I say, we could make [[Delineations|distinctions]] here. One of the distinctions it is quite common to make these days is between [[craving]], tanha, and [[clinging]], upadana. And so that craving is the momentary impulse to have something or to get away from something. So it can work both ways, as an [[aversion]], aversive movement, to move away from something we do not like, what is unpleasant, or to move towards, "I want that thing, I want to get it, I want to have it." This is craving, that kind of movement of the mind, that [[desire]]. And then, if we distinguish them, then clinging, upadana, is when that becomes more obsessive, if you like, or more entrenched, so we start circling around that thing, thinking about it a lot, scheming ways to get it, et cetera. There is a consolidation, a tightening, a reinforcing, a solidification that is happening[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Clinging is more obsessive craving|.]] ^2-3
###### 2-4
So, can be helpful to distinguish them. Certainly can be helpful at a certain level. But distinguishing and differentiating them will not actually solve the issues that I want to address and draw [[attention]] to tonight. Can be helpful, but those doors that I alluded to earlier that can actually be shut by thinking about practice in a certain way, thinking about practice and [[Dharma]] in a certain way, conceiving of it a certain way, they will remain shut even if I make certain differentiations here among those Pali words[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Distinguishing between clinging and craving is sometimes not necessary|.]] ^2-4
###### 3-1
Historically, by the way, I do not know if there is that much - if you really study the texts, you see how much overlap there really is between all these words, and historically, you know, the [[Dependent Origination|twelve links of dependent origination]] - so [[Craving|tanha]] and [[Clinging|upadana]] are two links in those twelve links of dependent origination, of the wheel of [[Dukkha|suffering]] as some people call it - those twelve links, and in fact the wheel, there is good evidence they were taken from a [[Vedic]] creation hymn/myth that preexisted the [[Buddha]] by a long time. There would have been a concept, that whole twelve links, that was already quite well-known in the society. The Buddha picked it up, used those twelve links and the whole as a set, which was already there, and he used it in a very different way, pointed in a very different direction. One would think, well, if the Vedic hymn had had eleven links, would there be certain [[Delineations|distinctions]], or would the Buddha have picked up a set with eleven links? Sometimes he talks about dependent origination with ten links, other times he adds ones, they overlap. So the whole sort of project of getting - and I will say more about this tomorrow - too picky about fine distinctions and trying to carve out this kind of clarity, sometimes it is helpful, and sometimes it is actually not that helpful; why bother? It actually does not open what needs opening. So there is a little caution there. But for what I want to get at tonight, it actually does not help that much[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Relationship to Dependend Origination 2 of the 12 links|.]] ^3-1
###### 3-2
In probably part two of this talk, I want to go into, actually explain more in detail, a very important practical reason or reason for practice and for [[insight]] why differentiating, for example, between [[craving]] and [[clinging]] is actually not that helpful sometimes, in fact does not actually make sense, the deeper we go into practice. But for now, actually, let us respect that distinction that is there with those different words and very briefly kind of go through some examples using the map of the links of [[dependent origination]]. I am hoping you are familiar with this already. I am going to go through very briefly as a way of kind of looking at the anatomy of that whole process of clinging, craving, [[desire]], and the way it leads to [[Dukkha|suffering]]. So we could pick any example, really, all kinds of things, what happens when we see, you know, chocolate cake, looks very enticing, and the whole process that happens there, could happen inside us. So we could take that as an example[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#We could pick out any example for the 12 links |.]] ^3-2
###### 3-3
Let us take [[craving]] for a cigarette, for someone who is addicted to smoking. So if we start, there is a [[Avijja|delusion]], [[Ignorance|avijja]] in the Pali, delusion or ignorance. Really in this case one aspect of that ignorance is not really getting it, not really [[Insight|understanding]], "This is bad for me. This is not healthy. This will cause [[Dukkha|suffering]] in the future to my health." I know two friends who have family members really, really seriously ill with emphysema after years of smoking. So something much earlier, it knows this is bad for us, does not really get it; the avijja is too thick there, too entrenched. So not really understanding[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1# Smoking Avijja|.]] ^3-3
###### 3-4
There is [[sankhara]], the second link, these kind of habit formations, if you like, or tendencies. So all the [[habit]] of moving to reach for the cigarette pack, to light up, the whole, if you like, momentum that gets wired into the nervous system, into the mind, into the body, that habit of doing that, those habits involved in that. Maybe a habit when we feel a little bit uneasy, that is the impulse, to reach for the cigarettes. A little socially anxious, or just after dinner, to relax or whatever it is. These habits are part of the sankharas[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Sankhara|.]] ^3-4
###### 3-5
And then we might take an example, you know, if you are addicted to cigarettes in this example, and maybe you are out somewhere and you see how the mind and senses, the mind and the [[consciousness]] and the sense doors, become, if you like, honed or primed or cocked a little bit to notice, for instance, other people smoking. Maybe we are walking down a city street or sitting outside in a cafe at night and we see other people smoking, and the [[craving]] arises. So easily the craving, just this little impulse, this little sort of [[contraction]]: "I want." Maybe it barely has a thought at first, but there is a movement, a kind of grasping movement of the being, this craving[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Craving|.]] ^3-5
###### 3-6
And that can intensify into what we might call [[clinging]], upadana, so that this [[craving]], this [[desire]] for a cigarette, comes more to dominance in the mind. And maybe the mind starts thinking, "I really need one. I really need a cigarette right now. I could really use a cigarette. It would be really nice," whatever it is. So thinking starts to get involved and it starts to become more dominant and more tenacious. The grasping is more tenacious. And then this intensifies even more to what could be called becoming. Sometimes it is translated as becoming. So maybe we do start playing with the cigarette packet. Maybe even take a cigarette out, roll it in our fingers. Maybe even stick it unlit in the mouth and just sort of hang it there. That is okay, right, because I have not lit it yet. And maybe we say to ourselves, "Ah, just one. I know I was going to quit. I can quit tomorrow" or whatever. The mind starts justifying something to itself, justifying this whole mechanism of desire and its wily ways[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Clinging|.]] ^3-6
###### 4-1
And eventually this gathers enough force and momentum and dominance that we do light up, light that cigarette, take a long inhale. And then there is relief with that, relief of all this tension that was building up, both through the physical addiction in this case but also a tension of what was involved in the mind there. They are lighting up, enjoying that cigarette. And in a way, that process, we could say, we have taken [[birth]], physical birth as the smoker self, the smoker is born at that point[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Birth|.]] ^4-1
###### 4-2
But unfortunately that relieved smoker self is a very fragile, sort of brittle self, and very soon something flips. Maybe a little while after the cigarette we start to feel, "Ah, I failed. I failed in my resolve." Maybe the [[The Self|self-view]] becomes "I am weak. I can not do it. I do not have the willpower. I am bad in some way." So there is this relieved self, the smoker self that was enjoying the cigarette that was born. It actually dies, it fractures, it collapses, and it is actually replaced with a [[Dukkha|suffering]] self, if you like. You could say that. So [[death]] and - what are those words - despair, lamentation, sorrow, et cetera. Strong words. But the suffering comes out of that. In this case it is just the view, "I just can not do it. I failed again. I am weak," and the suffering with that[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Death|.]] ^4-2
###### 4-3
But out of that [[Dukkha|suffering]], does not stop there, out of that suffering, because then those self-views are reinforced, the belief that I can not, and actually through that, the will, if you like, the willpower to quit smoking is strengthened. Something rolls on, samsara rolling on, flowing on. And of course the [[Habit|habits]], the [[Sankhara|sankharas]], the movement, the programming of the tendencies of mind and body - in this case to reach for cigarettes, to go for cigarettes when we do not feel that good, or when we do feel good or whatever - all that gets reinforced through this whole process[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Process gets reinforced|.]] ^4-3
###### 4-4
So, if you like, so to speak, one time through the cycle just gives the whole wheel momentum there. This is very briefly sketching these processes out. We could take another example. Maybe a more complicated example. Perhaps I have been out with some friends for a night out and we were in a bar or something. And there is a, I do not know, a group of women there, and I am with my male friends or whatever, and a few of us go over to chat to these women. And I am chatting to one who I find attractive, and in the course of this brief chat, and she seems maybe a little coy or whatever, but I give her my number. I give her a card with my phone number on it. But wrapped up in all that, in my impulse, is the - well, lots of different kinds of [[Ignorance|avijja]], [[Avijja|delusion]], ignorance. So it is not a simple thing, avijja. But let us say I have a pattern of believing that if a woman shows interest in me, then it proves my [[Pleasantness|okayness]], it proves my lovability. So there is some belief that something here will prove something about [[the self]]. There is all kinds of delusion; maybe that is my particular pattern[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Another example dating|.]] ^4-4
###### 4-5
So there is an aspect of the [[Avijja|delusion]] that has to do with my belief in what would prove my lovability. Even in that, you can see that is got all kinds of components involved in that delusion. Now, with that [[Ignorance|avijja]], with that particular ball of avijja there, I also unfortunately have a tendency to view myself, of course, as perhaps not okay or as maybe not attractive, and with that also a tendency to try to prove my attractiveness, my [[Pleasantness|okayness]], to others and to myself. So there is this belief maybe that I am not okay; there is a belief in what would prove it; and there is a tendency to view myself that way and to try to prove it. I keep trying in the world - how much of my actions and choices and speech and dress and everything is trying to prove something[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Example cont|.]] ^4-5
###### 4-6
Already there is [[dukkha]] there, there is [[pain]], you can see. And all this - I have given her my number, and I have gone away, but it is loaded, the whole thing has loaded my [[consciousness]], because of the [[Ignorance|avijja]], because of these [[Sankhara|sankharas]], loaded my consciousness, primed my consciousness, my mind and my senses. So the next day, the next few days, I am at work and I can see how the consciousness perhaps narrows around this: "Is she going to call?" And maybe it builds, you know, and the body keeps checking the mobile phone. "Any messages? Any messages? Any messages?" And maybe it starts building. It is actually impinging on my ability to concentrate on other stuff like my work. There is [[craving]] there. The craving already is complex: I am craving a certain sound or message notification from my phone, but that is wrapped up - a lot of stuff is wrapped up in that. Craving to check, to be able to check my phone. So there is craving there, all kinds of levels of craving. Maybe I even get irritated in those stretches of time when I can not. Perhaps I have to go for a meeting with the boss and I have to look really sharp and present something or whatever, or listen to what he/she says very carefully, and I am a little bit irritated because at that point I can not check my messages[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#"Is she going to call"|.]] ^4-6
###### 5-1
So this whole thing is building and perhaps there is increasing frequency to how I am checking the messages and obsessive thinking about it. And I can notice in all this how the mood and the [[The Self|self-view]] are really buffeted around with waves of excitement, anticipation, hope, [[anxiety]], despondency, and it is just going up and down. There, someone's ringing me now, I do not recognize the number. "Oh, maybe this is her." And I pick it up and it is someone trying to sell me health insurance or something. There was that swelling up, anticipation, excitement, the becoming, and then the crash. Or again, it rings and again it is a number I do not recognize. I pick it up, and it is just someone with the wrong number. And the same thing, this [[Impermanence|rise and fall]] of the becoming of the self. And then maybe a few days goes by, a week or I do not know how long, and she does not call. But in that week I am becoming increasingly despondent. "She will not call." And that is reinforcing something: "I am unattractive. It is true." And let us say she does not call, and then that self-view gets solidified. "Now I have evidence there." And usually this is not so clear as a thinking process; it is kind of jammed together like spaghetti that has kind of melted into each other. It is not so clear, "She did not call, therefore I am unattractive." Something is happening in the whole mind, getting compressed and mixed up and confused and oppressed. But basically she did not call and this self-view of being somehow not okay, somehow unattractive, has been solidified through this whole process. Then a little more time goes by, a week or a couple of weeks or whatever, and that whole painful self-view that has become so jammed and dense and heavy and painful, that actually just over time, being involved in other stuff, et cetera, having other things demand my [[attention]], preoccupations, et cetera, distractions, whatever, it gets a little less solid, a little more broken up, a little less intense[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Rise and fall of the becoming of the self|.]] ^5-1
###### 5-2
There is the break up or the [[death]], if you like, of that [[The Self|self-view]] to a certain extent. In this case it is a negative self-view that is dying, so there is some relief. But still what the [[Buddha]] called the [[asavas]], the outflows, the effluent - actually it is a related word for sewage - the effluent, the outflows from all that, if I do not question all this business about self-view and how I am trying to prove something to myself and to the world, if I do not question all that, the [[Ignorance|avijja]], the ignorance, and the [[Sankhara|sankharas]], the tendencies to try and prove, to believe certain things - without questioning, that process, that whole cycle goes through its whole painful contractions and life and death and dissolution or relative disappearance or abeyance for a time, but without the questioning, without the questioning of my belief that I need to somehow - that there is one way to address this sense of unattractiveness or not-[[Pleasantness|okayness]], that is by proving it - without questioning all that, I am just reinforcing. The whole pattern gets reinforced[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Pattern gets reinforced|.]] ^5-2
###### 5-3
So it rose up, it got solid, it dissolved over time, but because there was no questioning, the whole thing just got reinforced. The seeds have gotten bigger, so the next time it comes back it is perhaps even a little bit stronger. This will happen until something other, until I have another way of relating, [[Insight|understanding]], prying loose this whole process. So [[pain]], pain. [[Craving]] and [[clinging]] and all that process bringing [[Dukkha|suffering]], bringing dukkha[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#The seeds have gotten bigger|.]] ^5-3
###### 5-4
Now, sometimes what we [[Craving|crave]] is actually what the [[Buddha]] called vibhava-tanha, a craving for kind of non-being, for kind of like [[Death|extinction]]. Sometimes we have that just when we want to go to bed at night; there is a craving I just want to turn everything off, I have had enough of the day, you know? But sometimes there is really strong instances - for instance, someone wanting to just get completely plastered drunk. There is something seeking a kind of oblivion and a kind of dissolution of [[the self]] in that wish, that we seek obliteration, oblivion, and a kind of extinction, vibhava-tanha. Sometimes what is happening is in the object that we seem to be craving - maybe it is the chocolate cake or whatever - that there is actually a painful emotion underneath. Maybe we feel lonely. Maybe we feel unloved. And it is painful to be with that, and something in the chocolate cake and that whole putting it in the mouth and chewing it in this very primal way there is pleasure involved in that absolutely, but at another level of the craving, we are seeking to obliterate or cover over or numb out the painful emotion underlying it. This is quite common in relation to food[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Craving for extinction|.]] ^5-4
###### 6-1
So it is complex, all this. There is different forces operating, if you like, different intentions operating. Or also what happens - and this is interesting, too - is that if we pay [[attention]] to this, actually [[craving]] itself is uncomfortable. There is a kind of pressure that builds with craving. I want that thing, like with the cigarette example, or could be the chocolate cake, whatever it is, and that craving itself is [[dukkha]]; it feels uncomfortable. So what we end up actually wanting by the time we have access to the cigarette or the cake or whatever it is is actually as much the pleasure of the cake as it is the relief of the pressure, the bursting of that uncomfortable bubble of pressure of the craving, so that we are seeking a kind of obliteration of the pressure, the uncomfortable pressure of the craving[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Craving itself is dukkha|.]] ^6-1
###### 6-2
So all this can be involved in what is going on for us with [[craving]] and [[clinging]] and that whole process. Now, we could have - I am going through this very quickly; we could have gone through it much more slowly, certainly a whole talk on one example like this and kind of taking apart the pieces and mapping it onto those [[Dependent Origination|twelve links]]. If you do want more detail with more [[Delineations|distinctions]], this kind of stuff is not hard to find these days. One place is in the book that I wrote, [[Seeing That Frees]]. Chapter 10, I think, is devoted to going into this in quite a lot of detail. Or [[Payutto]], a Thai Monk, wrote a book called Dependent Origination. You can find it. It is not hard to find. It is also not difficult to understand. It is just, as I said, a kind of anatomy. Several times with different groups over the years I have done teaching sessions where we sort of lay it out on the floor, these twelve links, and then we go through different scenarios of how [[Dukkha|suffering]] gets built up and tied together and [[Contraction|contracted]] in difficult situations, either real ones or hypothetical ones. It is almost always interesting to me how much people enjoy doing that. You have got this map, and you are kind of together looking at, if you like, the tragedy but also the comedy of the human mind in this process of tying itself up in knots, et cetera. But people really seem to enjoy, interestingly, this kind of dissecting of the anatomy or physiology or the process of suffering in this way, of clinging and suffering in this way[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#The tragedy but also the comedy of human life|.]] ^6-2
###### 6-3
And partly it is because something in the human mind seems to like chopping things up and mapping them out and feeling like, "Oh, there is this word that the [[Buddha]] used, and there is this in my [[experience]], and I can kind of map them together," and it seems to us that we recognize something of a truth here, and so we have the feeling I have understood something. I recognize a component of the process, and I understand it. So people often - we often enjoy that feeling. I am sometimes not at all convinced that that seeming recognition and seeming so-called [[Insight|understanding]] actually makes much difference. Is it really helpful? What we really need here is practices to be able to actually pick up these concepts, if those are the concepts we are using, and really practice with them. So if we are using this idea of the [[Dependent Origination|twelve links of dependent origination]], where exactly can I come in in that process, what are the points of entry - and there are various points of entry - that I can come in and actually contemplate in a different way in the moment, or pay [[attention]], bring my [[mindfulness]] to bear on a certain link or feature, whatever it is, in ways that actually make a difference, relieve [[Dukkha|suffering]], disband to a certain extent some suffering[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Does understanding make a difference|.]] ^6-3
###### 6-4
Without that, then we get this kind of - really unfortunate, it is a kind of illusion of [[Insight|understanding]] something, because it looks like we are being clear, because we have got something that looks concrete mapped onto some concept that is in the teachings that the [[Buddha]] used that otherwise might have remained more abstract. "Great, I have understood something." There is this clarity of carving up and mapping and corresponding concepts. What we really need is practice on the front, so to speak, where the action is, and ways of practicing that are powerful, specific, helpful[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Illusion of understanding something|.]] ^6-4
###### 7-1
So the [[Buddha]] said a lot about all this and in different ways. You know, he said, he pointed out, we can [[Clinging|cling]] - there is lists of what we can cling to or [[Craving|crave]], and he said, for instance, [[Hindrances|sense pleasures]] is an obvious one. We cling to the pleasures available in the senses. We cling, he said, also, to our views and opinions. We cling to our customs and [[Habit|habits]], wherever they come from, the personal or more social or cultural or religious or secular cultural, whatever. And we also cling to self-views, different views of [[the self]], beliefs about the self[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#The Buddha on clinging|.]] ^7-1
###### 7-2
So all that is there, and sometimes people do dissect this anatomy and present it as a teaching or try and approach the teachings that way. And sometimes all this is there, and the [[Buddha]]'s making all these [[Delineations|distinctions]], et cetera, and what we take as a message is this teaching "just [[Letting go|let go of everything]], just let go of everything." [laughs] Even as I say it now, you can recognize it is like - it simultaneously feels like a hugely tall order, and at the same time it is so attractive as a teaching. It is so simple. Just let go of everything. Just let go of everything. And we [[love]], something in us loves simplicity. Something in us is seduced by simplicity and simple teachings and simple solutions. Even if we acknowledge that that is very challenging, it is a very simple message, "Just let go of everything. Just go with the flow. Be with the flow. Just be in the moment. Be in the present. But do not even [[Clinging|cling]] to that idea. Just be in the present." Very simple, and the attraction of what I have called simplism in other teachings, in other talks I have given. In this "just let go of everything," then [[Awakening|liberation]] has nothing to do, per se, with an [[experience]] or any experience. So you get the instruction, "Do not try to repeat experiences. Even if they are wonderful, insightful experiences and openings and mystical experiences and all that, do not try to repeat. That is just clinging. Just let go of everything, let go of everything. Liberation is a relationship of non-clinging with experience. That is what liberation is. Liberation is non-clinging." So it is not an experience; it is a relationship[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#"Just let go of everything"|.]] ^7-2
###### 7-3
It is very enticing and attractive, the simplicity of that teaching. And then, people are different, they may take some of those divisions the [[Buddha]] talked about and take them as areas of investigation, but just basically the teaching is [[Letting go|let go of everything]]. Just let go of everything. And of course, we can be - I mean, some people are - completely over-simple. So almost not even going into any tools and how we might even let go of everything. But generally speaking, we offer tools, and tools are offered. So the first one would be, for a start, how do I notice [[craving]]? Do I even recognize the [[experience]] of craving? Because how can I let go if I do not recognize it? So that is an important aspect here. It is an important question. How do I notice craving? How do I notice that movement of [[desire]] or [[clinging]], whatever we want to call it? Well, one obvious way is my thoughts tell me. So I have to be aware of my thoughts. My thoughts tell me, when they keep returning to this same object, when I hear the mind say "I want," or, even more, "I need," "I need that chocolate cake" or whatever it is. So my thoughts tell me in different ways. They reveal the presence of clinging by the way they circle around some object or start to obsess around something or whatever[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#How do I notice craving|.]] ^7-3
###### 7-4
But perhaps even more than that, we can recognize that [[craving]] itself - as I mentioned earlier - is already [[dukkha]]. It is not just that it leads to dukkha. So this smoking will cause suffering, et cetera. The [[experience]] of craving itself, the force of craving itself, is already uncomfortable. It is already a dis-ease. There is dukkha there. So this presence of dukkha, my [[mindfulness]] revealing a feeling of dukkha, just slight dis-ease, uneasiness, et cetera, imbalance, if you like - all that reveals, aha, there is some craving. What is it that I am craving? So that - at a much more subtle level than would be revealed in our thoughts, because craving can be quite active and quite present even when there is no thought in the mind. When there is no thought, there can still be craving. So this is what I want to go into probably in the next talk, is that when we use these words, craving and [[clinging]], we are really talking about a huge range from very, very gross and obvious to extremely subtle. So at some point, thought no longer needs to be there for the more subtle aspects or subtle [[manifestations]] of craving[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Huge range of what contitutes craving|.]] ^7-4
###### 7-5
But when there is [[craving]], there is noticeable... almost all the time, let us say... no, let us say all the time, there is with craving a tension that is noticeable. In the body, maybe in the musculature, maybe even more subtle than that when it gets really quite subtle, in the sort of felt space of what I call the [[energy body]] or the subtle body, a tension, a [[contraction]] comes in, and even more subtle than that, in what we might call the mind-space. So again, it is not about thoughts. It is about there is a certain cramping in the otherwise more natural [[spaciousness]] and openness of the mind. So this is what tells me that craving is present, this tension/contraction which will be felt as some degree of [[Dukkha|dis-ease]] in the body or mind-space[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#How to tell that craving is active in the body|.]] ^7-5
###### 8-1
That is different than deliberately narrowing the [[attention]], like right now I can deliberately focus my attention on the tip of my index finger and the sensations right there in the middle, so I am deliberately narrowing. That is fine; that is a [[mode of mind]], if you like. But with [[craving]], there is a tension/[[contraction]] that comes into the body and the mind-space that we can feel and that we can get increasingly sensitive to noticing[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Bodily tensioncontraction|.]] ^8-1
###### 8-2
So one teaching would be when you notice [[craving]], [[Letting go|just let go]] of the craving. Just let go of whatever it is you are craving. Let go of that. And again, sounds simple, and it might work sometimes. Sometimes this might work. It is just let go of wanting the chocolate cake. Just let go. Or I am attached to views, "So-and-so said this, but I think that is wrong, da-da-da-da," just let go of it. So that is one kind of instruction is just notice it and let it go. Let us run through a few of the sort of maybe more common tools, if you like, that are in the service of this "just let go of everything" sort of teaching. So one is notice it and let go of whatever the object that you are craving is, or whatever you are [[clinging]] to, which sometimes works and as you will all know sometimes does not work. A second would be to use some skillful reflection. So here is this thing, maybe it is that chocolate cake that I notice there is this craving towards it, whatever, and just to reflect, for example - this is a common teaching - on the [[impermanence]] of [[Hindrances|sense pleasures]]. So I am going to eat that slice of chocolate cake, or three slices of chocolate cake, whatever it is, and then an hour later either I am going to have a tummy ache [laughs] if I have eaten too much, or it will just be gone. It is like, where did it go? Where is that pleasure now? How much lasting fulfillment can it really give me[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Techniques of "just let go of everything" 1|?]] ^8-2
###### 8-3
So this is a very common teaching. It is just reflect on the [[impermanence]] of [[Hindrances|sense pleasures]], of what we are [[clinging]] to. And if it is clinging to views and opinions, it is just actually, again, reflecting, "Well, how many times in the past have I changed my view, sometimes to the diametrically opposed one? And oftentimes I have views and opinions about things that I actually do not really know. If I am really honest, I do not know what the truth is there. I am so attached to my view and my opinion," and just to reflect, I do not really know, or my view might change. Or to reflect, here is this clinging, here is maybe this obsession about something or again, whatever, the chocolate cake or whatever, is this clinging or this obsession or this thing that my mind keeps chewing over, is this really taking me where I want to go? So I could go down this road of thinking about this, obsessing about it, worrying about it, fretting about it, et cetera. What will I have at the end of that? Will I have what I really want? Will I have peace? Will I have fulfillment[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#2 Skillful reflection|?]] ^8-3
###### 8-4
These are some very - again, I am going through very quickly. We will touch on these in the instructions. But you can find all this in plenty of other places, so I am just kind of running through, as I said, to set a context for the other material that I want to touch on. This is very common. I and probably every teacher, every [[Meditation|Dharma teacher]], has given these kind of teachings. But that would be the second, skillful reflection. The third possible tool is to become acquainted with, through [[mindfulness]], what we call [[papanca]], or proliferation, exaggeration, hype, storytelling that goes on, that the mind gets into when it gets really crazy about something. So I did not really elaborate, but for example, in the example where I gave the woman my number and then the whole story-building and hype around it, or maybe it is something that we want or that is really terrible if it happens, and there is a whole identity view and story and [[history]] and hyping up of [[the self]] and the issue involved. And we can see this happening[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#3 Understand papanca|.]] ^8-4
###### 8-5
This is another thing on [[Retreat|retreats]], how happy people are to hear [[stories]], funny stories of [[papanca]][[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#People like to hear funny stories about papanca 1|.]] ^8-5
###### 8-6
It is a relief. We realize, "Oh, I am not the only one to be crazy that way." But just hearing these [[stories]], it is not going to cut the mustard at a very deep level. But at any rate, we begin to recognize, our [[mindfulness]] begins to get more familiar with these times and states of mind when the mind has just got into a complete spin. And we could say, using language a certain way, that when it is in this state of [[Papanca|proliferation]] and storm-building, building a storm in a teacup, we are [[Fabrication|fabricating]], the mind is fabricating, and instead of being with the basic [[experience]] of something - here is this [[contraction]] in my chest and instead of just being with the sensations I am bringing in a whole story of my patterns of closed-heartedness and that has to do with my mother and her mother and all this stuff, and something that is, at one level, just some sensations that will pass has become this whole heavy story that it is absolutely terrible, I must get rid of this, et cetera[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Papanca <> fabrication|.]] ^8-6
###### 9-1
And afterwards, when it dissolves a little bit, we begin to see we were [[Fabrication|fabricating]] something. ^9-1
###### 9-2
There was this [[papanca]] state, this whole web-weaving of complication and elaboration, proliferation, around self and around issue and all of that. There is [[fabrication]]. And in contrast to that, when we are just so-called simply [[Mindfulness|mindful]], we can be - there is the sensation in the chest, yeah, it is [[contraction]], it is unpleasant, and we can be with that sensation in what we sometimes call [[Attention|bare attention]], and that state of mindfulness and of so-called bare attention is a state of no papanca and no fabrication; we are just with the thing as it is. And through repeated mindfulness practice, we actually get more of a taste for this, more of a taste of living without papanca, not caught up in the maelstrom in that teacup, not entangled in the sort of cobwebs and the imprisonment, really, of all this intricate, thick, over-elaborated storytelling[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Mindfulness as antidote to papanca|.]] ^9-2
###### 9-3
So a degree of [[clinging]] and [[craving]] is released when we let go of that [[papanca]] and we are with things more in the way of what we could call simple [[mindfulness]] or we could call [[Attention|bare attention]] or we could say being with things as they are, simply. So that simple mindfulness practice in contrast to papanca and seeming to see that we are not [[Fabrication|fabricating]] when we are mindful. That is a skillful tool, too. Another one, a little bit more - I do not know what you would call - precise, if you like. Let us take a negative example. For example, the craving to be rid of something, what we call [[aversion]]. So here maybe I am sitting on a [[retreat]] or something and my back hurts or my knees hurt or something. And there is the [[Vedana|unpleasant vedana]], the unpleasant sensations, and there is a craving to be rid of them, there is a rejection, there is a pushing away. Again, maybe my mind is saying, "Oh, come on. Ring the bell. When is this sitting over?" and spinning all kinds of [[stories]] about, again, "I have this [[pain]] because I am such a [[Contraction|contracted]] [[Personhood|human being]]," et cetera, "Other people do not have it," whatever it is[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#4 Role of vedana|.]] ^9-3
###### 9-4
But maybe even without thought, as I said, there is no thought, there is just this [[pain]] and this energetic push, rejection of that [[experience]], a kind of tensing of the being, of the body and of the mind, to get rid of, to hold it at arm's length, to [[Aversion|push it away]]. And this, again, we can feel, we can notice. And one skillful strategy is actually just to come to train the [[attention]] and just see, can I hold it right at that point in the body where the [[Vedana|unpleasant vedana]] are just coming up like a fountain. Moment after moment, there is that unpleasantness, unpleasant sensation, unpleasant sensation, unpleasant sensation, in my back or in my knee or whatever it is. Looking that way and kind of intent but with some relaxation as well, in a kind of balanced way, just honing, training, focusing the attention just as much as I can at that kind of fountain, if you like, of moment-to-moment unpleasant vedana. And then I will notice the [[craving]] go with that[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Technique focus on vedana|.]] ^9-4
###### 9-5
So there is the [[Vedana|unpleasant vedana]], and there is this rejection, and they kind of go together. But what I can - so there is the arising of the unpleasant and then this kind of impulse of rejection, this energetic push away. Of course, can see this with pleasant sensations, as well - sometimes it is really interesting eating and watching this movement. Here is this delicious food that is being, maybe, again, [[Retreat|on retreat]], cooked for me, or I cooked it for myself at home or whatever it is, and I am eating, and I am really paying [[attention]] to the arising of the pleasant sensations in the mouth. The food is in my mouth, and then I can still notice, curiously, how something in the being, in the mind, is kind of [[Craving|grasping]]. It is like this movement of grasping, movement towards, to hold, to grasp, to hold onto, to encompass those pleasant sensations. So I see the [[pleasantness]] and I see this impulsive, energetic movement to grasp. The food is already in my mouth, and the pleasantness is already there, and there is still this grasping[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Impulsive energetic movement|.]] ^9-5
###### 10-1
So I can see it either way, and I stay steady at the [[vedana]], and then what happens is that - and again, this is separating notions of [[craving]] from [[clinging]] - I see the craving, the impulse arise, but it does not build up so much. So I can just stay, for example, with this [[pain]] in the body, this moment-to-moment arising of vedana, and I just watch these little bursts of impulse, of craving, of rejection, of [[Aversion|pushing away]], arise, but they just sort of arise and subside, they arise and they subside, and this consolidation and building of that and solidification, entrenchment of that into what might be called clinging, it does not arise because I am just staying close to the vedana and the craving. So that would be a fourth[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Clinging doesn't happen if we stay with the craving vedana|.]] ^10-1
###### 10-2
A fifth is, again, relating back to what I touched on earlier, to actually develop an ability where I am paying more [[attention]] to the actual [[experience]] of [[craving]] and noticing that pressure that is involved in craving. So back to the cigarette example, or the chocolate cake example, whatever it is, here the mind has the [[image]] of the cigarette, and then I can feel the pressure build of the craving, or maybe it is [[clinging]]. I can feel that pressure build in the body, maybe even more than the mind, and instead of seeking to obliterate and release and sort of pop that uncomfortable bubble of pressure by having the cigarette, et cetera, I am actually - just give that some space, just let that pressure kind of build, ebb, and it swells, and then I will notice, oh, it reaches a certain point and it just subsides again. Maybe it does that again. But what is happening there is I am staying with it and giving it space, that is key, and I am learning to tolerate, I am developing my capacity to tolerate that uncomfortable pressure so that I do not just have to give in to it[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#5 Experience the pressure that is involved with craving|.]] ^10-2
###### 10-3
In time, what happens is instead of getting reinforced, that force of [[craving]], instead of being reinforced because I keep giving in to it because I can not tolerate that pressure, I tolerate the pressure, it ebbs, releases, it subsides. And over time, the very force of the craving when it comes back next time is a little less, a little less. So I am learning the skill of tolerating. I am also eroding that particular craving, and maybe the pattern of craving in general. So that would be a fifth option. And a sixth is more general, touching on what we touched on, elaborating a little bit more what we said before, is actually just paying [[attention]] to [[impermanence]] in general, really being aware, anicca, everything is impermanent, everything is impermanent. So this is so much the thrust of so much [[Meditation|insight meditation]]: just see that everything is impermanent, just notice, you know. How can you not but notice? If you are [[Mindfulness|mindful]], you will see that things are impermanent. And we start to notice it more and more. And if we notice that things are impermanent, we let go. We see there is no point chasing things that will just be impermanent. There is no point [[clinging]] to things that are going to dissolve anyway, et cetera[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#6 Paying attention to impermanence|.]] ^10-3
###### 10-4
At least that is the theory. And there is a certain amount of truth in that. When we see [[impermanence]], we let go. So the noticing of impermanence, the [[attention]] to impermanence, generally speaking, brings [[letting go]]. That would be a sixth possibility. Maybe with that sixth possibility we have times where - eventually, through practice - we see, "Wow, there really is just this process of impermanent things. Where is the personality here? The personality is a process that is constructed. [[The self]] is just a process of momentary [[Phenomenon|phenomena]], momentary factors of mind, momentary moments of [[perception]] or [[consciousness]] or impulse, et cetera. There is just this process of impermanent events or impermanent things, and I am like that, the self is like that, everything is - that is all there is." And again, generally speaking, when we see that, a degree of fundamental [[Ignorance|avijja]], fundamental [[Avijja|delusion]] about reality, if you like, is cut away, and there is generally speaking less [[clinging]] because there is, if you like, a less solidified - we do not believe so much in such a solidified sense of self. Sometimes that is what happens and that does work[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Impermance brings less solidification|.]] ^10-4
###### 10-5
But you can already hear... [laughs]. I apologize, I am not selling this very well. [laughs] I perhaps could have done a better job of selling it. But in a way, that is my whole point. That is my whole point. So all this, what I have said so far, in what I have laid out in terms of teachings and approaches to [[letting go]] of [[clinging]] and [[desire]] and [[craving]] and all that in these ways and these approaches, it is not that it is wrong. It is not wrong. It is all good. It is not that the [[Insight|understanding]] is wrong, per se. But it is limited. That is my main point. It is limited in both depth and breadth. If we only respond to desire and only view desire, for example, with the lens, "Well, what can this really give me, because everything is [[Impermanence|impermanent]]. Might as well let go," or if we only try to live with [[mindfulness]], with so-called [[Attention|bare attention]], staying at the so-called bare [[experience]] or staying at the [[vedana]] even, and if we believe that mindfulness and so-called bare attention is really a state of [[Papanca|non-papanca]], nonproliferation, and really a state of complete non-[[fabrication]], if this kind of more or less sums up my [[Meditation|Dharma practice]] and what I am trying to do and how I conceive of the [[Dharma]], then I will have missed and I will continue to miss the possibility of really deep insight[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#I'm not selling this very well|.]] ^10-5
###### 11-1
Something there, as I said at the beginning, shuts off certain doors - in this case, the doors of depth, the doors to a much more radical depth. It also, living that way, viewing that way, those ways, is simply not also going to be helpful. There will be situations, there will be instances, there will be streams or threads in my life where it is very helpful, but there will be plenty where it just is not helpful. Just needs some intelligence and reflection to expose that fact. Plenty of threads in my life where it is completely not helpful to approach it with [[Attention|bare attention]], to approach the dropping of [[desire]] because "what can this really give me," to believe I am being with reality through [[mindfulness]]. All of that, there is a kind of - if I try and do that, even with a sort of feeling of breadth and all-encompassingness, or especially if I have that feeling of all-encompassingness, there is something a bit - I do not know - silly in it[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Dropping of desire is not always helpful|.]] ^11-1
###### 11-2
Because as well as just simply discerning what are helpful and unhelpful [[Desire|desires]] in different situations - very basic; have not even talked about that - but as well as that, so much more is possible. So much more is possible. So how do we think of the [[Dharma]]? Was the [[Buddha]] just saying, "Let go. Let go. Do not [[Clinging|cling]] and live peacefully. Let go and live peacefully"? Is that what the Dharma is? Is that all the Dharma can be? "Let go and live peacefully." Whose Buddha is that? Or is it - and this is what I want to go into in a bit more detail - is it, first of all, that through practice, through picking up this idea of clinging, [[craving]], et cetera, and exploring it experientially, with a certain (what I am going to call) practical intelligence, facility in practice, and I start to learn something about [[letting go]] of clinging, through practice, at deeper and deeper levels, and something happens in that process - the whole world of [[experience]] opens up, dissolves, opens up to a completely different level, if you like, a [[mystical opening]], mystical openings, plural[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#How do we think of the Dharma|.]] ^11-2
###### 11-3
We can see the whole world unbound. We open to the [[Unfabricated]]. If we follow this thread of [[clinging]] in certain ways, or [[letting go]] of clinging, we follow that, subtler and subtler, deeper and deeper, we can know what is unfabricated. Radical, different sense of existence, and we understand the [[Emptiness|emptiness of all things]]. Something very, very deep, very profound here. Again, going back to what we said before, even contemplating [[impermanence]] more and more rapidly in the [[meditation]], the [[mindfulness]] gets very intense, it is true that sometimes really intensely focusing on rapid impermanence, very finely, something can happen that can kind of pop that whole [[experience]] and suddenly the walls are shattered, and the walls of the world are shattered, and we are opened to the Unfabricated. No subject, no object, no thing, no experience in any kind of conventional sense, no space, no time. Not just no past and future - no present. Something utterly, utterly transcendent and different[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Seeing the world unbound|.]] ^11-3
###### 11-4
But I am not quite sure how that happened, I was just contemplating [[impermanence]] and then something popped. And it might be that indeed a certain [[freedom]] comes out of that exposure to the [[Unfabricated]], that knowing of that. But I come back to the ordinary world of [[experience]], of ordinary [[Perception|appearances]], and perhaps it is not really clear to me what the relationship is of that world of appearances to that world of non-appearance, of the Unfabricated. Somehow I need to be contemplating this whole teaching about [[clinging]], and practicing with the teachings about clinging in ways that let me understand something about the relationship between appearances and what we might call non-appearance or the Unfabricated. The relationship of this world of time, where it seems obvious that everything is impermanent, and the world of the timeless. Not the world of permanence, but not the world of impermanence - the world of timelessness. What is the relationship there? And might not a fuller freedom, a deeper freedom, a more beautiful freedom, and a great [[Beauty|sense of beauty]] come when I really understand, through approaching the teachings about clinging practically, in [[meditation]], in certain ways, in ways that let me understand this relationship of appearances to non-experiences, the relationship of the, if you like, experience of non-appearance, the experience of the Unfabricated, of the timeless, to the world of appearances and experience, conventional experiences and time[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Can there be more|?]] ^11-4
###### 12-1
So if I am too simplistic and I have the goal of just living without [[clinging]], that is what [[Awakening|liberation]] is, and I am not kind of picking up this teaching of clinging in a way that is actually going to unlock something much more profound, reveal something about existence much more profound, much more radical, there is a danger there. I need to pick it up in a way that will help me do that. So it can be limited if I take the teachings in a way that will limit them. It is limited in depth. It is also limited in breadth, and that is the second thing that I want to go into. So again, just having the idea of [[letting go]] of [[desire]], letting go of [[craving]], et cetera, even when we differentiate [[Kusala|wholesome]] and unwholesome desires, even then, what I would like to go into is there will be something in that way of approaching things, something in that attempt, something in that conception of the [[Dharma]], of what practice is and where it is leading, will not allow an adequate view of self, of others, of things, of the world, and also desire itself, in other ways, not just to do with this depth of knowing the [[Unfabricated]], depth of knowing the [[Emptiness|emptiness of things]], but in other ways, it will not be adequate. That is what I want to go into on this [[retreat]]. We will say a little bit about it in part two of this talk[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Teachings which are limited in depth and breath|.]] ^12-1
###### 12-2
So there is a possibility that the way we are thinking about these teachings about [[Clinging|non-clinging]], the way that we are conceiving of it, is, if you like, oversimplistic, and it will limit both the depth that we are able to open to and thus our whole sense of existence, and also a kind of breadth in terms of how we then view the things of this world in other ways, which I will go into, that have to do with [[beauty]] and [[Divinity|sacredness]]. This is what I hope to elaborate[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Teachings of non-clinging can be oversimplistic|.]] ^12-2
