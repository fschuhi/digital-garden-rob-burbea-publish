###### 1-1
What I would like to do tonight is give a talk that in some ways could just stand alone, talking about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">non-clinging</a></span>. But in other ways (and this is my main purpose, really), hopefully give something in a way that serves or gives a kind of preface, if you like, to the set of talks that we're going to start around the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Alchemy" data-href="Alchemy" class="internal-link">alchemy of desire</a></span>, around <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and practice. So a kind of preface - a slightly strange preface, but one that serves to give a context, or at least _part_ of a context, for what many would probably consider relatively unusual teachings in the rest of the set. So I want to give part of a context tonight, and as well as context, begin also to contrast different <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understandings</a></span> or visions or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a></span> that we can have of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, and of this teaching of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">non-clinging</a></span> in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Could be a standalone talk on clinging but will set context" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Could be a standalone talk on clinging but will set context" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1

That's the main point, to begin to contrast something. Because we can take away, from listening to teachings, or reading teachings, or even be given through teachings an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> or a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span> of what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> is that shapes our practice, and shapes our whole sense of what the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> is, and what the project is, and what <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> is, and what we're moving towards, and what's involved, an <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>, that is certainly helpful to a degree for many people, and certainly freeing to a certain extent, again, for many people, but that also shuts doors. This is the contrast I want to make, between different <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understandings</a></span>, different <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a></span>, one of which, if you like, or a group of which, I would say, helpful as it is, freeing as it is to a certain extent, also ends up shutting doors - doors that, if you like, open to a much wider and much more radical <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>, and openness of being and of the sense of existence<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Different conceptual frameworks different understandings" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Different conceptual frameworks different understandings" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2

So part of a context, begin to contrast some different large-scale <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understandings</a></span>, and where they might lead, or what they might block off. Actually, I think I've pretty much talked about all of this before, and certainly written about much of it, and I don't particularly like to repeat myself. I don't see the point if it's already out there, generally, [and] would rather move on to new stuff. So a lot of this will be quite brief. Also, not all of this, but much of it is widely available. There's probably not a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma teacher</a></span> alive, and certainly not an <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> teacher, who doesn't talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, certainly at one of the levels that I want to talk about. So some of it will be moving through territory quite briefly for those reasons, but I do want to draw out a couple of things, a couple of main points that I've maybe only mentioned before here and there, important as they are, again, for the sake of context and for the sake of contrast<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Youve probably heard the teachings about non-clinging before" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#You've probably heard the teachings about non-clinging before" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3

When we look in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a></span>, the collected teachings, the early teachings of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>, the historical <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>, we find a lot of different words, like English, a lot of different words - like English, we have <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, greed, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>. Many words. English is a very rich language. And similarly in Pali, in the language of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>, we have a word like _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">rāga</a></span>,_ which actually is meaning 'to colour' or 'to dye.' The colouring, like especially rouge; it's related to the word 'red,' 'to make rouge.' But it really means '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>,' 'excitement.' Later on, we'll emphasize this: the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span> colours something. When we colour things red, we become impassioned, or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span> also colours things, so there's a link there. But there's this word _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">rāga</a></span>_, usually translated as '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>' or 'lust.' _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kama" data-href="Kama" class="internal-link">Kāma</a></span>_ can have two meanings. One is 'the object of sensual <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a></span>.' The _object_, so something that is sensually pleasing. But also 'sense <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>.' The verb _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kameti" data-href="Kameti" class="internal-link">kāmeti</a></span>_ means 'to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>' or 'to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">crave</a></span>.' There's the word _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">lobha</a></span>,_ which can be translated as 'greed.' _Gedha_, also translated as 'greed.' ^1-4
###### 2-1
There's a word, _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="chanda" class="internal-link">chanda</a></span>_, which is an interesting word, because sometimes you can talk about _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="chanda" class="internal-link">chanda</a></span>_, for example, in Pali, called _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">hitacchanda</a></span>._ That's 'the effort to do good.' _Hita_ is what's 'useful,' or 'suitable,' or 'beneficial,' or 'friendly.' So when we talk, for example, in _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice, about well-wishing or doing good in the world, it's _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">hitacchanda</a></span>_. _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Chanda" class="internal-link">Chanda</a></span>_ is really 'impulse' or 'intention' or 'will.' It could be 'virtuous.' It could be 'a virtue' or 'a vice,' 'the motivation to accomplish.' It means all that. It can also mean 'excitement,' related to 'impulse' there. Sometimes people want to make a distinction: _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="chanda" class="internal-link">chanda</a></span>_ is positive because it's good intention, or it _can_ be good, and words like _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">rāga</a></span>,_ _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kama" data-href="Kama" class="internal-link">kāma</a></span>_, _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">lobha</a></span>_, etc., these are negative words: they lead to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, they are unskilful, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Chanda is impulse intention will" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Chanda is impulse intention will" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1

However, there are also plenty of instances in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a></span> where, for instance, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sariputta" data-href="Sariputta" class="internal-link">Sāriputta</a></span>, in the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samyutta Nikaya" data-href="Samyutta Nikaya" class="internal-link">Saṃyutta Nikāya</a></span>,_ says, "_<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Chandaraga" data-href="Chandaraga" class="internal-link">Chandarāga</a></span>_, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> and lust, these are <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fetters" class="internal-link">fetters</a></span>."^[SN 35:191] Okay? So _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="chanda" class="internal-link">chanda</a></span>_ there is not qualified; he's just saying it's a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fetters" data-href="Fetters" class="internal-link">fetter</a></span>. There are words like _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">taṇhā</a></span>_, which is usually translated as '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>,' and _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">upādāna</a></span>_, '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>,' usually translated, or 'attachment.' This is quite an interesting word, because it also means literally 'a fuel,' or 'that which supports' something. So it can be '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>,' 'holding on,' '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>,' as something that _supports_. And what does it support? It supports <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. But as we go deeper, we'll see that it supports a whole lot more than that. It supports the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>; supports the very sense of reality; supports <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> too; supports any <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. It's fuel for <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. This is taking the whole thing to another level. We'll come back to this<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Clinging supports suffering" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Clinging supports suffering" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2

But there are all these words in Pali. And in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a></span>, one way or another, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> says, "<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">The path</a></span> leads to the end of ...", and he uses any of these words, _any_ of them. So in a way, they're kind of used interchangeably. We can certainly make <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a></span>, and try and carve out <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a></span> there, but generally, although there are <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a></span>, generally they're pretty much interchangeable. And the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> and the teachings say they are all <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fetters" class="internal-link">fetters</a></span>: _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kama" data-href="Kama" class="internal-link">kāma</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">taṇhā</a></span>, gedha, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">rāga</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">lobha</a></span>,_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>, lust, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, etc., <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. All <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fetters" class="internal-link">fetters</a></span>, _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fetters" data-href="Fetters" class="internal-link">saṃyojanāni</a></span>_, which means '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fetters" data-href="Fetters" class="internal-link">fetter</a></span>,' like 'yoke,' like an oxen that's ploughing a field has a yoke to pull that on. It's something that imprisons<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Fetters" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Fetters" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3

And the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> talks about different <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fetters" class="internal-link">fetters</a></span>, and in the process, in the stages of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightenment</a></span>, how different <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fetters" class="internal-link">fetters</a></span> are 'eradicated,' is really the word that he uses. So _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kamacchanda" data-href="Kamacchanda" class="internal-link">kāmacchanda</a></span>,_ or 'sensual <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>,' is eradicated at the third stage of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>, and at full <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>, full <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightenment</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">arahantship</a></span>, the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">rāga</a></span>_, _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">rūparāga</a></span>_, or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span> or the lust for material existence, for material <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="birth" class="internal-link">birth</a></span>, for forms (if you prefer more experientially, getting away from the whole teaching of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="rebirth" class="internal-link">rebirth</a></span> and all that). The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>, the lust for material forms. And _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aruparaga" data-href="Aruparaga" class="internal-link">arūparāga</a></span>,_ the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span> and lust for immaterial realms or immaterial _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a></span>_, or, if you do the whole <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="rebirth" class="internal-link">rebirth</a></span> thing, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="rebirth" class="internal-link">rebirth</a></span> in a formless realm. And also eradicated at <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">arahantship</a></span> is _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">uddhacca</a></span>_, which is an interesting word: '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a></span>,' 'agitation,' 'excitement,' 'flurry,' 'imbalance,' 'shakiness' (in the sense of being shaken by <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>). It's the opposite of being subdued. It's also related to the word 'lifting up,' _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">uddhata</a></span>_, 'to lift up,' 'to rise high,' 'to be risen.' So that too - being able to be lifted up, being able to be excited, out of balance, in a flurry, not being subdued. What's the opposite of 'subdued' in English? That's '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a></span>,' sometimes, usually translated as _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">uddhacca</a></span>._ That's also eradicated<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Fetters and arahantship" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Fetters and arahantship" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4

As I say, we could make <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a></span> here. One of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a></span> it's quite common to make these days is between '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>' (_<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">taṇhā</a></span>_) and '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>' (_<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">upādāna</a></span>_), so that '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>' is the momentary impulse to have something or to get away from something. It can work both ways, as an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, aversive movement, to move away from something we don't like, what's unpleasant, or to move towards: "I want that thing. I want to get it. I want to have it." This is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, that kind of movement of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. And then, if we distinguish them, then <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">upādāna</a></span>_, is when that becomes more obsessive, if you like, or more entrenched, so we start circling around that thing, thinking about it a lot, scheming ways to get it, etc. There's a consolidation, a tightening, a reinforcing, a solidification that's happening<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Clinging is more obsessive craving" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Clinging is more obsessive craving" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1

So, can be helpful to distinguish them. Certainly can be helpful at a certain level. But distinguishing and differentiating them won't actually solve the issues that I want to address and draw <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to tonight. Can be helpful. But those doors that I alluded to earlier, that can actually be shut by thinking about practice in a certain way, thinking about practice and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> in a certain way, conceiving of it a certain way, they will remain shut even if I make certain differentiations here among those Pali words<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Distinguishing between clinging and craving is sometimes not necessary" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Distinguishing between clinging and craving is sometimes not necessary" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2

Historically, by the way, I don't know if there's that much - if you really study the texts, you see how much overlap there really is between all these words. And historically, you know, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">twelve links of dependent origination</a></span> - so _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">taṇhā</a></span>_ and _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">upādāna</a></span>_ are two links in those <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">twelve links of dependent origination</a></span>, of the wheel of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, as some people call it - those <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">twelve links</a></span>, and in fact the wheel, there's good evidence they were taken from a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Vedic" class="internal-link">Vedic</a></span> creation hymn/myth that pre-existed the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> by a long time.^[Joanna Jurewicz, "Playing with Fire: The pratītyasamutpāda from the perspective of Vedic thought," _Journal of the Pali Text Society,_ 26 (2000), 77-103, [https://www.academia.edu/8181977/Playing_with_Fire_The_prat%C4%Abtyasamutp%C4%81da_from_the_perspective_of_Vedic_thought](https://www.academia.edu/8181977/Playing_with_Fire_The_pratītyasamutpāda_from_the_perspective_of_Vedic_thought)] There would have been a concept, that whole <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">twelve links</a></span>, that was already quite well-known in the society. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> picked it up, used those <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">twelve links</a></span> and the whole as a set, which was already there, and he used it in a very different way, pointed in a very different direction. One would think, well, if the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedic" data-href="Vedic" class="internal-link">Vedic hymn</a></span> had had eleven links, would there be certain <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a></span>, or would the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> have picked up a set with eleven links? Sometimes he talks about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dependent origination" class="internal-link">dependent origination</a></span> with ten links. Other times he a^[E.g. at SN 12:65, where _avijjā_ and _saṅkhārā_ (the first two links in the standard twelve-link presentation of dependent origination) are omitted.]dds ones; they overlap. I'll say more about this tomorrow: the whole project of getting too picky about fine <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a></span>, and trying to carve out this kind of clarity, sometimes it's helpful, and sometimes it's actually not that helpful. Why bother? It actually doesn't open what needs opening. So there's a little caution there. But for what I want to get at tonight, it actually does not help that much<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Relationship to Dependend Origination 2 of the 12 links" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Relationship to Dependend Origination 2 of the 12 links" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3

In probably part two of this talk, I want to go into, actually explain more in detail, a very important practical reason or reason for practice and for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, why differentiating, for example, between <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> is actually not that helpful sometimes, [and] in fact doesn't actually make sense, the deeper we go into practice. But for now, actually, let's respect that distinction that's there with those different words, and very briefly kind of go through some examples using the map of the links of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dependent origination" class="internal-link">dependent origination</a></span>. I'm hoping you're familiar with this already. I'm going to go through very briefly as a way of kind of looking at the anatomy of that whole process of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, and the way it leads to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. So we could pick any example, really, all kinds of things: what happens when we see chocolate cake, looks very enticing, and the whole process that happens there, could happen inside us. So we could take that as an example<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > We could pick out any example for the 12 links " data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#We could pick out any example for the 12 links " class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-4

Let's take <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> for a cigarette, for someone who's addicted to smoking. If we start, there is a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>, _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_ in the Pali, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span>. Really, in this case, one aspect of that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span> is not really getting it, not really <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>: "This is bad for me. This is not healthy. This will cause <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the future to my health." I know two friends who have family members really, really seriously ill with emphysema after years of smoking. Something much earlier on, it _knows_ this is bad for us, doesn't really get it - the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_ is too thick there, too entrenched. So not really <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 >  Smoking Avijja" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1# Smoking Avijja" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-5

There's _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sankhara" data-href="Sankhara" class="internal-link">saṅkhārā</a></span>_, the second link, these kind of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sankhara" data-href="Sankhara" class="internal-link">habit formations</a></span>, if you like, or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">tendencies</a></span> - so all the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> of moving to reach for the cigarette pack, to light up; the whole, if you like, momentum that gets wired into the nervous system, into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, into the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> of doing that, those <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span> involved in that. It may be a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> when we feel a little bit uneasy, that that's the impulse, to reach for the cigarettes. A little socially anxious, or just after dinner, to relax or whatever it is. These <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span> are part of the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sankhara" data-href="Sankhara" class="internal-link">saṅkhāras</a></span>_<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Sankhara" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Sankhara" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-1
###### 4-2
And then we might take an example, you know, if you're addicted to cigarettes in this example, and maybe you're out somewhere, and you see how the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and senses, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> and the sense doors, become, if you like, honed or primed or cocked a little bit to notice, for instance, other people smoking. Maybe we're walking down a city street, or sitting outside in a cafe at night, and we see other people smoking, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> arises. So easily the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, just this little impulse, this little sort of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span>: "I want." Maybe it barely has a thought at first, but there's a movement, a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> movement of the being, this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Craving" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Craving" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-2
###### 4-3
And then that can intensify into what we might call '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>,' _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">upādāna</a></span>,_ so that this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> for a cigarette, comes more to dominance in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. And maybe the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> starts thinking, "I really need one. I really need a cigarette right now. I could really use a cigarette. It would be really nice," whatever it is. So thinking starts to get involved, and it starts to become more dominant and more tenacious. The <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> is more tenacious. And then this intensifies even more to what could be called 'becoming.' Sometimes it's translated as 'becoming.' So maybe we _do_ start playing with the cigarette packet. Maybe even take a cigarette out, roll it in our fingers. Maybe even stick it unlit in the mouth, and just sort of hang it there. "That's okay, right? Because I haven't lit it yet." And maybe we say to ourselves, "Ah, just one. I know I was going to quit. I can quit tomorrow," or whatever. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> starts justifying something to itself, justifying this whole mechanism of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> and its wily ways<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Clinging" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Clinging" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-3
###### 4-4
And eventually this gathers enough force and momentum and dominance that we do light up, light that cigarette, take a long inhale. And then there's relief with that, relief of all this tension that was building up, both through the physical addiction, in this case, but also the tension of what was involved in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> there. They're lighting up, enjoying that cigarette. And in a way, that process, we could say, we've taken <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="birth" class="internal-link">birth</a></span>, physical <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="birth" class="internal-link">birth</a></span> as the smoker self. The smoker is 'born' at that point<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Birth" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Birth" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-4
###### 4-5
But, unfortunately, that relieved smoker self is a very fragile, sort of brittle self, and very soon something flips. Maybe a little while after the cigarette we start to feel, "Ah, I failed. I failed in my resolve." Maybe the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span> becomes "I'm weak. I can't do it. I don't have the willpower. I'm bad in some ways." So there's this relieved self, the smoker self that was enjoying the cigarette that was born. It actually dies, it fractures, it collapses, and it's actually replaced with a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> self, if you like. You could say that. So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> and - what are those words? - despair, lamentation, sorrow, etc. Strong words. But the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> comes out of that. In this case, it's just the view, "I just can't do it. I failed again. I'm weak," and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> with that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Death" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Death" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-5
###### 5-1
But out of that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, it doesn't stop there, out of that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, because then those self-views are reinforced: the belief that I can't, and actually through that, the will, if you like, the willpower to quit smoking, is strengthened. Something rolls on, _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samsara" data-href="Samsara" class="internal-link">saṃsāra</a></span>_ rolling on, flowing on. And of course the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span>, the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sankhara" data-href="Sankhara" class="internal-link">saṅkhāras</a></span>,_ the movement, the programming of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">tendencies</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> (in this case, to reach for cigarettes, to go for cigarettes when we don't feel that good, or when we do feel good, or whatever), all that gets reinforced through this whole process<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Process gets reinforced" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Process gets reinforced" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1
###### 5-2
So, if you like, so to speak, one time through the cycle just gives the whole wheel momentum there. This is very briefly sketching these processes out. We could take another example, maybe a more complicated example. Perhaps I've been out with some friends for a night out, and we were in a bar or something. And there's, I don't know, a group of women there, and I'm with my male friends or whatever, and a few of us go over to chat to these women. And I'm chatting to one who I find attractive. I'm in the course of this brief chat, and she seems maybe a little coy or whatever, but I give her my number. I give her a card with my phone number on it. But wrapped up in all that, in my impulse, is lots of different kinds of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span>. It's not a simple thing, _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_. But let's say I have a pattern of believing that if a woman shows interest in me, then it proves my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">okayness</a></span>. It proves my loveability. So there's some belief that something here will prove something about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>. There's all kinds of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>; maybe _that's_ my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">particular pattern</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Another example dating" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Another example dating" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2
###### 5-3
So there's an aspect of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span> that has to do with my belief in what would prove my loveability. Even in that, you can see that's got all kinds of components involved in that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>. Now, with that _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_, with that particular ball of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_ there, I also unfortunately have a tendency to view myself, of course, as perhaps not okay or as maybe not attractive, and with that also a tendency to try to prove my attractiveness, my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">okayness</a></span>, to others and to myself. So there's this belief maybe that I'm not okay; there's a belief in what would prove it; and there's the tendency to view myself that way and to try to prove it. I keep trying in the world. How much of my actions and choices and speech and dress and everything is trying to prove something<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Example cont " data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Example cont " class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^5-3

Already there's _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ there, there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, you can see. And all this - I've given her my number, and I've gone away, but it's loaded. The whole thing has loaded my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, because of the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_, because of these _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sankhara" data-href="Sankhara" class="internal-link">saṅkhāras</a></span>_, loaded my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>. It's primed my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, and my senses. So the next day, the next few days, I'm at work, and I can see how the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> perhaps narrows around this: "Is she going to call?" And maybe it builds, you know, and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> keeps checking the mobile phone: "Any messages? Any messages? Any messages?" And maybe it starts building. It's actually impinging on my ability to concentrate on other stuff like my work. There's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> there. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> already is complex: I'm <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> a certain sound or message notification from my phone, but that's wrapped up - a lot of stuff is wrapped up in that. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a></span> to check, to be able to check my phone. So there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> there, all kinds of levels of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. Maybe I even get irritated in those stretches of time when I can't. Perhaps I have to go for a meeting with the boss, and I have to look really sharp and present something or whatever, or listen to what he/she says very carefully, and I'm a little bit irritated because at that point I can't check my messages<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Is she going to call" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Is she going to call" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-4
###### 5-5
So this whole thing is building, and perhaps there's increasing frequency to how I'm checking the messages, and obsessive thinking about it. And I can notice in all this how the mood and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span> are really buffeted around with waves of excitement, anticipation, hope, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span>, despondency. It's just going up and down. "There, someone's ringing me now. I don't recognize the number. Oh, maybe this is her." And I pick it up, and it's someone trying to sell me health insurance or something. There was that swelling up, anticipation, excitement, the becoming, and then the crash. Or again, it rings, and again, it's a number I don't recognize. I pick it up, and it's just someone with the wrong number. And the same thing, this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">rise and fall</a></span> of the becoming of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>. And then maybe a few days go by, a week or I don't know how long, and she doesn't call. But in that week I'm becoming increasingly despondent: "She won't call." And that's reinforcing something: "I _am_ unattractive. It's true.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Rise and fall of the becoming of the self" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Rise and fall of the becoming of the self" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^5-5

And let's say she doesn't call, and then that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span> gets solidified: "Now I have evidence there." Usually this is not so clear as a thinking process; it's kind of jammed together like spaghetti that has kind of melted into each other. It's not so clear, "She didn't call, therefore I am unattractive."

In this case, it's a negative <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span> that's dying, so there's some relief.

So it rose up, it got solid, it dissolved over time, but because there was no questioning, the whole thing just got reinforced.

Now, sometimes what we <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">crave</a></span> is actually what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> called _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">vibhava-taṇhā</a></span>_, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> for kind of non-being, for kind of like <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Death" data-href="Death" class="internal-link">extinction</a></span>. Sometimes we have that just when we want to go to bed at night. There's a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>: "I just want to turn everything off. I've had enough of the day," you know? But sometimes there are really strong instances. For instance, someone wanting to just get completely plastered drunk. There's something seeking a kind of oblivion and a kind of dissolution of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> in that wish, that we seek obliteration, oblivion, a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Death" data-href="Death" class="internal-link">extinction</a></span>, _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">vibhava-taṇhā</a></span>_. Sometimes what's happening is, in the object that we seem to be <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> (maybe it's the chocolate cake or whatever), that there's actually a painful emotion underneath. Maybe we feel lonely. Maybe we feel unloved. And it's painful to be with that, and something in the chocolate cake, and in that whole putting it in the mouth and chewing it in this very primal way, there is pleasure involved in that, absolutely, but at another level of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, we're seeking to obliterate or cover over or numb out the painful emotion underlying it. This is quite common in relation to food<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Craving for extinction" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Craving for extinction" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-4

So it's complex, all this. There are different forces operating, if you like, different intentions operating. Or also what happens - and this is interesting too - is that if we pay <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to this, actually <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> itself is uncomfortable. There's a kind of pressure that builds with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. I want that thing, like with the cigarette example, or could be the chocolate cake, whatever it is, and that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> itself is _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>._ It feels uncomfortable. So what we end up actually wanting by the time we have access to the cigarette or the cake or whatever it is, it's as much the pleasure of the cake as it is the relief of the pressure, the bursting of that uncomfortable bubble of pressure of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, so that we're seeking a kind of obliteration of the pressure, the uncomfortable pressure of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Craving itself is dukkha" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Craving itself is dukkha" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-1

All this can be involved in what's going on for us with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and that whole process. Now, I'm going through this very quickly. We could have gone through it much more slowly - certainly a whole talk on one example like this, and kind of taking apart the pieces, and mapping it onto those <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">twelve links</a></span>. If you _do_ want more detail, with more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a></span>, this kind of stuff is not hard to find these days. One place is in the book that I wrote, _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Seeing That Frees" class="internal-link">Seeing That Frees</a></span>._ Chapter 10, I think, is devoted to going into this in quite a lot of detail.^[Rob Burbea, _Seeing That Frees_: Meditations on Emptiness and Dependent Arising (Devon: Hermes Amāra, 2014), 118-31] Or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Payutto" class="internal-link">Payutto</a></span>, a Thai monk, wrote a book called _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">Dependent Origination</a></span>_.^[Prayudh Payutto,_Dependent Origination: the Buddhist Law of Conditionality_, tr. Bruce Evans (Bangkok: Buddhadhamma Foundation, 1994), [https://www.dhammatalks.net/Books3/Payutto_Bhikkhu_Dependent_Origination.htm](https://www.dhammatalks.net/Books3/Payutto_Bhikkhu_Dependent_Origination.htm)] You can find it. It's not hard to find. It's also not difficult to understand. It's just, as I said, a kind of anatomy. Several times with different groups over the years, I've done teaching sessions where we sort of lay it out on the floor, these <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">twelve links</a></span>, and then we go through different scenarios of how <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> gets built up and tied together and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">contracted</a></span> in difficult situations, either real ones or hypothetical ones. It's almost always interesting to me how much people enjoy doing that. You've got this map, and you're kind of together looking at, if you like, the tragedy, but also the comedy of the human <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> in this process of tying itself up in knots, etc. But people really seem to enjoy, interestingly, this kind of dissecting of the anatomy or physiology or the process of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in this way, of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in this way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > The tragedy but also the comedy of human life" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#The tragedy but also the comedy of human life" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-2

And partly it's because something in the human <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> seems to like chopping things up and mapping them out, and feeling like, "Oh, there's this word that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> used, and there's this in my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, and I can kind of map them together." It _seems_ to us that we recognize something of a truth here, and so we have the feeling I've understood something. I recognize a component of the process, and I understand it. So people often - we often enjoy that feeling. I'm sometimes not at all convinced that that seeming recognition and seeming so-called '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>' actually makes much difference. Is it really helpful? What we _really_ need here is practices to be able to actually pick up these concepts, if those are the concepts we're using, and really practise with them. So if we're using this idea of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">twelve links of dependent origination</a></span>, where exactly can I come in, in that process? What are the points of entry (and there are various points of entry) that I can come in and actually contemplate in a different way in the moment, or pay <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, bring my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> to bear on a certain link or feature, whatever it is, in ways that actually make a difference, relieve <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, disband to a certain extent some <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Does understanding make a difference" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Does understanding make a difference" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^7-3

Without that, then we get this kind of - it's really unfortunate: it's a kind of illusion of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> something, because it looks like we're being clear, because we've got something that looks concrete mapped onto some concept that is in the teachings that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> used, that otherwise might have remained more abstract. "Great, I've understood something." There's this clarity of carving up and mapping and corresponding concepts. What we _really_ need is practice on the front, so to speak, where the action is, and ways of practising that are powerful, specific, helpful<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Illusion of understanding something" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Illusion of understanding something" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-4

So the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> said a lot about all this, and in different ways. You know, he said, he pointed out, we can <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a></span> - there are lists of what we can <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a></span> to or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">crave</a></span>. He said, for instance, to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasures</a></span> is an obvious one. We <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a></span> to the pleasures available in the senses. We <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a></span>, he said, also, to our views and opinions. We <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a></span> to our customs and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span>, wherever they come from: the personal, or more social, or cultural, or religious, or secular cultural, whatever. And we also <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a></span> to self-views, different views of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, beliefs about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>.^[E.g.

So all that's there, and sometimes people do dissect this anatomy and present it as a teaching, or try and approach the teachings that way. And sometimes all this is there, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s making all these <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a></span>, etc., and what we take as a message is this teaching: "Just <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a></span>." [laughs] Even as I say it now, you can recognize, it's like, it simultaneously feels like a hugely tall order, and at the same time, it's so attractive as a teaching. It's so simple: "Just <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a></span>." And we <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, something in us loves simplicity. Something in us is seduced by simplicity, and simple teachings, and simple solutions. Even if we acknowledge that that's very challenging, it's a very simple message: "Just <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a></span>. Just go with the flow. Be with the flow. Just be in the moment. Be in the present. But don't even <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a></span> to that idea.

Very simple, and the attraction of what I've called 'simplism' in other teachings, in other talks I've given. In this "just <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a></span>," then <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">liberation</a></span> has nothing to do, per se, with an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, or _any_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. So you get the instruction, "Don't try to repeat experiences. Even if they're wonderful, insightful experiences and openings and mystical experiences and all that, don't try to repeat. That's just <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. Just <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Liberation</a></span> is a relationship of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">non-clinging</a></span> with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. That's what <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">liberation</a></span> is. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Liberation</a></span> _is_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">non-clinging</a></span>." So it's not an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>; it's a relationship<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Dont try to repeat experiences" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Don't try to repeat experiences" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-3

It's very enticing and attractive, the simplicity of that teaching. And then, people are different; they may take some of those divisions that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> talked about, and take them as areas of investigation. But just basically, the teaching is "<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">Let go of everything</a></span>. Just <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a></span>." And of course, we can be - I mean, some people _are_ - completely over-simple. So almost not even going into any tools of how we _might_ even <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a></span>. But generally speaking, we offer tools, and tools are offered. The first one would be, for a start, how do I _notice_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>? Do I even recognize the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>? Because how can I let go if I don't recognize it? So that's an important aspect here. It's an important question. How do I notice <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>? How do I notice that movement of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, whatever we want to call it? Well, one obvious way is my thoughts tell me. I have to be aware of my thoughts. My thoughts tell me, when they keep returning to this same object, when I hear the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> say "I want," or, even more, "I need," "I need that chocolate cake" or whatever it is. So my thoughts tell me in different ways. They reveal the presence of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> by the way they circle around some object or start to obsess around something or whatever<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > How do I notice craving" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#How do I notice craving" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-4

But perhaps even more than that, we can recognize that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> itself, as I mentioned earlier, is already _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_. It's not just that it _leads_ to _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_. So this smoking will cause <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, etc. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> itself, the force of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> itself, is already uncomfortable. It's already a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dis-ease</a></span>. There is _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ there.

What is it that I'm <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>?" So that, at a much more subtle level than would be revealed in our thoughts, because <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> can be quite active and quite present even when there's no thought in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>.

So this is what I want to go into, probably in the next talk, is that when we use these words, '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>' and '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>,' we're really talking about a huge range from very, very gross and obvious to extremely subtle. So at some point, thought no longer needs to be there for the more subtle aspects or subtle <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="manifestations" class="internal-link">manifestations</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Huge range of what contitutes craving" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Huge range of what contitutes craving" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-5

But when there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, there is noticeable (_almost_ all the time, let's say - no, let's say _all_ the time), there is with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> a tension that is noticeable. In the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, maybe in the musculature; maybe even more subtle than that, when it gets really quite subtle, in the sort of felt space of what I call the '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>' or the '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">subtle body</a></span>,' a tension, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> comes in; and even more subtle than that, in what we might call the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> space. So again, it's not about thoughts. It's about there's a certain cramping in the otherwise more natural <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span> and openness of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. This is what tells me that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> is present, this tension/<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span>, which will be felt as some degree of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dis-ease</a></span> in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> space<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > How to tell that craving is active in the body" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#How to tell that craving is active in the body" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-1

That's different than deliberately narrowing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>. Like, right now I can deliberately focus my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> on the tip of my index finger, and the sensations right there in the middle, so I'm deliberately narrowing. That's fine; that's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mode of mind" class="internal-link">mode of mind</a></span>, if you like. But with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, there's a tension/<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> that comes into the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> space that we can feel, and that we can get increasingly sensitive to noticing<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Bodily tension contraction" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Bodily tension contraction" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-2

**(1)** So one teaching would be: when you notice <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, **<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">just let go</a></span>** of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">Just let go</a></span> of whatever it is you're <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. Let go of that. And again, sounds simple, and it might work sometimes. Sometimes this might work. It's just, let go of wanting the chocolate cake. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">Just let go</a></span>. Or I'm attached to views: "So-and-so said this, but I think that's wrong, _da-da-da-da._" It's like, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">just let go</a></span> of it. So that's one kind of instruction is just notice it and let it go. Let's run through a few of the sort of maybe more common tools, if you like, that are in the service of this "just <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a></span>" sort of teaching. So one is: notice it, and let go of whatever the object that you're <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> is, or whatever you're <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to, which sometimes works, and as you will all know, sometimes does not work<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Techniques of just let go of everything 1 notice craving and let go of it" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Techniques of just let go of everything 1 notice craving and let go of it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-3

**(2)** A second would be to use some **skilful reflection**. So here's this thing. Maybe it's that chocolate cake that I notice there's this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> towards it, whatever, and just to reflect, for example (this is a common teaching) on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasures</a></span>. So I'm going to eat that slice of chocolate cake, or three slices of chocolate cake, whatever it is, and then an hour later, either I'm going to have a tummy ache [laughs] if I've eaten too much, or it will just be gone. It's like, where did it go? Where is that pleasure now? How much lasting fulfilment can it really give me<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > 2 Skillful reflection" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#2 Skillful reflection" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^9-4
###### 9-5
So this is a very common teaching. It's just, reflect on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasures</a></span>, of what we're <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to. And if it's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to views and opinions, it's just actually, again, reflecting, "Well, how many times in the past have I changed my view, sometimes to the diametrically opposed one? And oftentimes I have views and opinions about things that I actually don't really know. If I'm really honest, I don't know what the truth is there. I'm so attached to my view and my opinion." And just to reflect: I don't really know, or my view might change. Or to reflect: here's this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. Here's maybe this obsession about something, or again, whatever, the chocolate cake or whatever. Is this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, or this obsession, or this thing that my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> keeps chewing over, is this really taking me where I want to go? So I could go down this road of thinking about this, obsessing about it, worrying about it, fretting about it, etc. What will I have at the end of that? Will I have what I really want? Will I have peace? Will I have fulfilment<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Different kinds of reflection" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Different kinds of reflection" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^9-5

These are some very [common teachings]. Again, I'm going through very quickly, and we will touch on these in the instructions. But you can find all this in plenty of other places, so I'm just kind of running through, as I said, to set a context for the other material that I want to touch on. This is very common. I, and probably every teacher, every <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma teacher</a></span>, has given these kind of teachings. But that would be the second: skilful reflection<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > These are some very common teachings" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#These are some very common teachings" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-1

**(3)** The third possible tool is to **become acquainted with, through <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, what we call _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_**, or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">proliferation</a></span>, exaggeration, hype, storytelling that goes on, that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> gets into when it gets really crazy about something. So I didn't really elaborate, but for example, in the example where I gave the woman my number, and then the whole story-building and hype around it, or maybe it's something that we want, or that's really terrible if it happens, and there's a whole identity-view and story and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span> and hyping up of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> and the issue involved. And we can see this happening. ^10-2
###### 10-3
This is another thing on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span>: how happy people are to hear <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a></span>, funny <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a></span> of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_. It's a relief. We realize, "Oh, I'm not the only one to be crazy that way." But just hearing these <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a></span>, it's not going to cut the mustard at a very deep level. But at any rate, we begin to recognize, our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> begins to get more familiar with these times and states of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> when the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> has just got into a complete spin. And we could say, using language a certain way, that when it's in this state of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">proliferation</a></span> and storm-building, building a storm in a teacup, we are <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricating</a></span>. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricating</a></span>. And instead of being with the basic <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of something - here is this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> in my chest, and instead of just being with the sensations, I'm bringing in a whole story of my patterns of closed-heartedness, and that has to do with my mother and her mother, and all this stuff. Something that's, at one level, just some sensations that will pass, has become this whole heavy story, that "It's absolutely terrible. I must get rid of this," etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > People like to hear funny stories about papanca" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#People like to hear funny stories about papanca" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-3

And afterwards, when it dissolves a little bit, we begin to see we were <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricating</a></span> something. There was this _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_ state, this whole web-weaving of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">complication</a></span> and elaboration and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">proliferation</a></span>, around self and around issue and all of that. There's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. And in contrast to that, when we're so-called 'simply <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a></span>,' there's the sensation in the chest. Yeah, it's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span>, and it's unpleasant. We can be with that sensation in what we sometimes call '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Attention" data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">bare attention</a></span>.' And that state of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> and of so-called '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Attention" data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">bare attention</a></span>' is a state of no _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_ and no <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. We're just with the thing 'as it is.' And through repeated <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> practice, we actually get more of a taste for this, more of a taste of living without _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_, not caught up in the maelstrom in that teacup, not entangled in the sort of cobwebs and the imprisonment, really, of all this intricate, thick, over-elaborated storytelling<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Papanca <> fabrication" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Papanca <> fabrication" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-4

So a degree of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> is released when we let go of that _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_ and we're with things more in the way of what we could call 'simple <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>,' or we could call '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Attention" data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">bare attention</a></span>,' or we could say 'being with things as they are, simply.'

###### 11-1
**(4)** Another one, a little bit more precise, if you like. Let's take a negative example. For example, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> to be rid of something, what we call <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>. Here, maybe I'm sitting on a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> or something, and my back hurts, or my knees hurt or something. And there's the unpleasant _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_, the unpleasant sensations, and there's a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> to be rid of them. There's a rejection. There's a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a></span>. Again, maybe my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is saying, "Oh, come on. Ring the bell. When's this sitting over?", and spinning all kinds of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a></span> about, again, "I have this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> because I'm such a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">contracted</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>," etc., "Other people don't have it," whatever it is<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > 4 Role of vedana" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#4 Role of vedana" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-1
###### 11-2
But maybe even without thought, as I said. There's no thought. There's just this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> and this energetic push, rejection of that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, a kind of tensing of the being, of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, to get rid of, to hold it at arm's length, to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">push it away</a></span>. And this, again, we can feel, we can notice. And one skilful strategy is actually just to come, to **train the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, and just see: can I hold it right at that point in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> where the unpleasant _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_ are just coming up like a fountain**? Moment after moment, there's that unpleasantness: unpleasant sensation, unpleasant sensation, unpleasant sensation, in my back or in my knee or whatever it is. Looking that way, kind of intent but with some relaxation as well, in a kind of balanced way, just honing, training, focusing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, just as much as I can, at that kind of fountain, if you like, of moment-to-moment unpleasant _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_. And then I'll notice the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> go with that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Technique focus on vedana" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Technique focus on vedana" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-2
###### 11-3
So there's the unpleasant _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_, and there's this rejection, and they kind of go together. There's the arising of the unpleasant, and then this kind of impulse of rejection, this energetic push away. Of course, I can see this with pleasant sensations as well. Sometimes it's really interesting, eating and watching this movement. Here's this delicious food that's being, maybe, again, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span>, cooked for me, or I cooked it for myself at home or whatever it is, and I'm eating, and I'm really paying <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to the arising of the pleasant sensations in the mouth. The food is in my mouth, and then I can still notice, curiously, how something in the being, in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, is kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>. It's like this movement of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>, movement towards, to hold, to grasp, to hold on to, to encompass those pleasant sensations. So I see the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a></span>, and I see this impulsive, energetic movement to grasp. The food is already in my mouth, and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a></span> is already there, and there's still this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Impulsive energetic movement" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Impulsive energetic movement" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-3
###### 11-4
So I can see it either way. I stay steady at the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_, and then what happens is that - and again, this is separating notions of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> from <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> - I see the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, the impulse arise, but it doesn't build up so much. So I can just stay, for example, with this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, this moment-to-moment arising of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_, and just watch these little bursts of impulse, of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, of rejection, of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a></span>, arise. But they just sort of arise and they subside, they arise and they subside, and this consolidation and building of that, and solidification, entrenchment of that into what might be called '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>,' it doesn't arise, because I'm just staying closer to the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_ and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. So that would be a fourth<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Clinging doesnt happen if we stay with the craving vedana" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Clinging doesn't happen if we stay with the craving vedana" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-4

**(5)** A fifth is, again, relating back to what I touched on earlier, to actually **develop an ability where I'm paying more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to the actual <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, and noticing that pressure that is involved in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>**. So back to the cigarette example, or the chocolate cake example, whatever it is, here the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> has the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of the cigarette, and then I can feel this pressure build of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, or maybe it's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. I can feel that pressure build in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, maybe even more than the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. And instead of seeking to obliterate and release and sort of pop that uncomfortable bubble of pressure by having the cigarette, etc., I'm actually - just give that some space, just let that pressure kind of build, ebb, and it swells, and then I'll notice: oh, it reaches a certain point, and it just subsides again. Maybe it does that again. But what's happening there is I'm staying with it and giving it space (that's key), and I'm learning to tolerate. I'm developing my capacity to tolerate that uncomfortable pressure so that I don't just have to give in to it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > 5 Experience the pressure that is involved with craving" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#5 Experience the pressure that is involved with craving" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-5

In time, what happens is, instead of getting reinforced, that force of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, instead of being reinforced because I keep giving in to it because I can't tolerate that pressure, I tolerate the pressure, it ebbs. It releases. It subsides. And over time, the very force of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> when it comes back next time is a little less, a little less. So I'm learning the skill of tolerating. I'm also eroding that particular <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, and maybe the pattern of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> in general. So that would be a fifth option<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > And over time the very force of the craving when it comes back next time is a little less" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#And over time the very force of the craving when it comes back next time is a little less" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-1

**(6)** And a sixth is more general. Touching on what we touched on, elaborating a little bit more what we said before, is actually **just paying <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> in general**, really being aware: _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">anicca</a></span>._ Everything is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span>.

And we start to notice it more and more. And if we notice that things are <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span>, we let go. We see there's no point chasing things that will just be <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span>. There's no point <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to things that are going to dissolve anyway, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > 6 Paying attention to impermanence" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#6 Paying attention to impermanence" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-2

At least that's the theory. And there's a certain amount of truth in that. When we see <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, we let go. So the noticing of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, generally speaking, brings <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span>. That would be a sixth possibility. Maybe, with that sixth possibility, eventually, through practice, there are times where we see, "Wow, there really is just this process of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span> things. Where is the personality here? The personality is a process that's constructed. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="The self" class="internal-link">The self</a></span> is just a process of momentary <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a></span>, momentary factors of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, momentary moments of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> or impulse, etc. There is just this process of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span> events or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span> things, and I am like that, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> is like that, everything is. That's all there is." And again, generally speaking, when we see that, a degree of fundamental _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_, fundamental <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span> about reality, if you like, is cut away. And there's, generally speaking, less <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, because we don't _believe_ so much in such a solidified <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>.

Something there, as I said at the beginning, shuts off certain doors - in this case, the doors of depth, the doors to a much more radical depth. It also, living that way, viewing that way, those ways, is simply not always going to be helpful. There will be situations, there will be instances, there will be streams or threads in my life where it's very helpful, but there will be plenty where it just is not helpful. Just needs some intelligence and some reflection to expose that fact. Plenty of threads in my life where it's completely not helpful to live with, to approach it with '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Attention" data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">bare attention</a></span>,' to approach the dropping of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> because "what can this really give me?", to believe I'm 'being with reality' through <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>.

So there's a possibility that the way we're thinking about these teachings about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">non-clinging</a></span>, the way that we're conceiving of it, is, if you like, oversimplistic, and it will limit both the depth that we're able to open to, and thus our whole sense of existence, and also a kind of breadth in terms of how we then view the things of this world in other ways, which I'll go into, that have to do with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span>. This is what I hope to elaborate<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1 > Teachings of non-clinging can be oversimplistic" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 1#Teachings of non-clinging can be oversimplistic" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-2
