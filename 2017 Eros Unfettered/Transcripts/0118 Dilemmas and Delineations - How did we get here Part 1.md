###### 1-1
This is really a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, a course, on the theme, on the subject, exploring the themes of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Alchemy" data-href="Alchemy" class="internal-link">alchemy of desire</a></span>. I want to take a little time now, over the next few talks, to begin to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">delineate</a></span> what _we_ mean when we use this word, '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>.' So to begin to do that. As you'll quickly see, the way we're using that word is actually woven in with a whole web, if you like, a whole dynamic web of other words that we're using quite specifically - related ideas, related notions, related experiences. So we'll have to kind of gradually unfold all this, unpack it, if you like, or gradually (reverse analogy) build a framework, an architecture that will help us here, build our ship or our vehicle<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > We will gradually unfold the semantic web of eros" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#We will gradually unfold the semantic web of eros" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1
###### 1-2
In the course of doing that, and explaining or unpacking a little bit - 'elaborating' is a better word - elaborating a bit on, gradually, what we mean by '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>,' and what it involves, what it implies, etc., where it goes, in the course of delineating, the question comes up: why? Why <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">delineate</a></span>? We touched on that briefly already, but there's actually more to say. Why make this extra delineation of something called <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>? Because we have a lot of words, like we said. We have <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, attachment, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, you know. So why make this extra delineation? I want to say a bit more about that. And I also want to weave into all this just some reflections on making <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="delineations" class="internal-link">delineations</a></span> and definitions in general. So some general reflections on that, because actually it is very relevant to the whole project that we're doing and where it can go<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Why delineate" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Why delineate" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2

So, you know, unless you teach in some way or other, in some subject or art or whatever it is, it may not be obvious to you, but it's obvious to me that teaching is always, _always_ contextual. In talking about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> now, there is the context. There's a double context, at least. One is the context of: how did we get here? What is it that led up to these kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="delineations" class="internal-link">delineations</a></span>, and making the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="delineations" class="internal-link">delineations</a></span> and the justifications and the explanations that we're about to go into slowly, gradually? That comes out of a whole trajectory, a whole progression of exploration and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> that, in a way, one thing led to the other, one thing unfolded another. So there's the context of where we're coming from. And, in a way - I'll go into this later - I'm coming from a background in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span>, but a certain way of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> and approaching what <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> is, and what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> is, and how to think of that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Teaching is always contextual" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Teaching is always contextual" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3
###### 1-4
But there's also the context of who one is talking to, who one is teaching, and the context in which one teaches. So that teaching about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, and shining a different light on them in a Buddhist context and in an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> context, _is_ a certain context. It's not necessarily the easiest or most straightforward context to raise these issues and hope to bring some fresh illumination or fresh turning of the earth, if you like. There are other contexts, for instance in - I don't know - psychotherapeutic contexts or philosophical contexts where, in a way, it would be much more straightforward. There would still be <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a></span> and things to make. But in some ways, the context that we're in makes it more challenging, but also we're lent certain advantages, I think, by our practice and by our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, that other disciplines and directions don't have<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Our context is Buddhist insight meditation" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Our context is Buddhist insight meditation" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4
###### 2-1
About the context: I remember an international meeting of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> teachers in 2009, I think it was. It actually took place at <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a></span>. It happens every, I don't know, three years? Something like that. Three or four years. It kind of rotates between three, maybe four centres - IMS, and Spirit Rock, and maybe Beatenberg; I can't remember - around the world. That year, it was at <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a></span>, and maybe eighty <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> teachers. I can't remember. Very senior ones, all the way down to very, very new teachers. And they're from all over the world - well, actually, mostly Europe and America, USA. So part of that group, we had three or four days together, I think, and there were different discussion groups that were sort of offered. Periodically we would break, and certain themes would be offered, and then the people interested in _this_ theme would go and make a little group and discuss it for a while, and people interested in another theme would go and make their little group and discuss it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > International meeting of Insight Meditation teachers Gaia House 2005" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#International meeting of Insight Meditation teachers Gaia House 2005" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
One day, one of the themes that was offered was <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. There are a couple of things to me that are interesting about what happened. One is that it was _by far_ [laughs] the biggest discussion group. So there was enormous interest in that topic, so much so that actually I think the group of people, the sub-group of the larger group that were interested in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and elected to go into _that_ group, had to be divided into three to make them manageable discussions and interesting and worthwhile<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Eros was the biggest breakout group" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Eros was the biggest breakout group" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
So I was in a group that I think had at least ten people in it, and there were maybe two others like that. That was the first thing: look how much interest there was in this topic in Buddhist practitioners, Buddhist teachers, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> teachers, already in 2009. Partly it's because so little is said about it in our tradition. So that was the first thing that was interesting. The second thing to me that was interesting was, we gathered in our group of, let's say, ten people (I can't remember), ten teachers, and a few of us, several of us, said, "Hold on. Before we get into this, can we actually just kind of say or agree what we mean by '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>'?" And immediately it became very apparent that there was no common [meaning]. We had come to this group with quite a large range of what people thought '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>' meant, or what it meant to them. No one was particularly attached to "it means this" or anything like that, but there was really not a clarity or a common, shared meaning, even<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > There was no common definition of Eros" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#There was no common definition of Eros" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
I remember one teacher just seemed to equate it with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> in general. If I understood her correctly, she was saying that her approach to this was - again, not very conventional <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, but it's more like, let the students have their <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span>. So if you want that chocolate cake, have the chocolate cake. If you want this or that, have it. And in having it, and feeling it, and exploring it, and going into that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, over time (this was the theory) their <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span> would mature. And so instead of being caught up with superficial and kind of unhelpful <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span>, there would be this maturation through actually going into the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, living it, experiencing, tasting, etc. Following the thread of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, there would be this maturation until they would get clear and centred on their deepest heart's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span>. So starting with the Mars bars, and eating them and whatever, eventually there would be this funnelling down, a natural maturation process that would happen. Now, that's probably not a fair summary of what she was saying, and I might have misunderstood. But anyway, she seemed to equate <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Some equated eros with desire" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Some equated eros with desire" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 2-5
Another teacher made the distinction saying, "This is all very well, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>" (this was a little later in the group), saying, "what _I'm_ more interested in is in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Thanatos" class="internal-link">Thanatos</a></span>_,_" he said. '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Thanatos" class="internal-link">Thanatos</a></span>,' some of you will know, is another Greek word. '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span>' is a Greek word. And in, I think it's Freudian psychoanalytic theory, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> is sometimes equated with the life instinct (the instinct to want to live), and contrasted with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Thanatos" class="internal-link">Thanatos</a></span> (the drive towards <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> instinct), which <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sigmund Freud" data-href="Sigmund Freud" class="internal-link">Freud</a></span> introduced later into his psychoanalytic theory. This teacher was saying, interestingly, he came to the group to hold the other pole, if you like: "I'm interested in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Thanatos" class="internal-link">Thanatos</a></span>, in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> instinct." I don't think he meant <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, per se; more as in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unfabricating</a></span> that we were talking about, the movement towards a kind of dissolution, _nibbāna_, in the traditional sense<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > One was more interested in Thanatos" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#One was more interested in Thanatos" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-5
###### 3-1
Related, but very different to that (and I can't remember what order this happened in) - there were quite a few senior teachers in this group, by the way - another teacher said that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s primary interest, or he was trying to persuade people that the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s primary interest was in addressing _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mara" data-href="Mara" class="internal-link">Māra</a></span>_, the sort of primordial, if you like, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Archetype" data-href="Archetype" class="internal-link">archetypal</a></span> villain in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a></span>, _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mara" data-href="Mara" class="internal-link">Māra</a></span>_. And _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mara" data-href="Mara" class="internal-link">Māra</a></span>_ actually means '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>.' So the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> was interested in _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mara" data-href="Mara" class="internal-link">amāra</a></span>_, which is also a word that's in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a></span> (less commonly, but it's there). _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mara" data-href="Mara" class="internal-link">Amāra</a></span>_, this teacher was saying, is in contrast to _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mara" data-href="Mara" class="internal-link">Māra</a></span>_ because it's a negation. _A-_ is _not_-death; therefore it means 'life.' So what the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> is really teaching is "life, live, be in your life," etc., and the sort of elevation of - well, I actually pointed this out to him, but the elevation of this concept of Life, that it becomes a kind of substitute for an idea of God or divine, which this teacher was very much against. But there was this equation of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> with life, as opposed to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> was very interested in life, and the sort of praise of life, if you like<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Another equates Eros with life" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Another equates Eros with life" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
It turned out that the person, I think, who even suggested the topic in general at first, when it came to her turn, what she meant by <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, she was actually quite unclear and sort of said she didn't know. We sort of just tried to elicit from her a little bit, and it turned out that what she really meant was that when she was teaching, she found that she kind of got into a mode where there was very little humour and very little sort of joke-telling, etc. There was not the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="juiciness" class="internal-link">juiciness</a></span> of humour. So that's what _she_ meant. This was a huge range, and I don't think [laughs] we even came to a conclusion about what we were talking about, which is oftentimes a problem with these kind of groups. But that was another thing that was interesting to me: that there was no clarity even about what is meant<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Yet another one meant juiciness - - there was no consensus" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Yet another one meant juiciness - - there was no consensus" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2

This is why, a little bit, I want to go into this - partly because it's a topic that people are interested in, and maybe especially people who have been practising a long time. Why? Because they recognize the lacuna there, the gap, presumably, in the teachings, around this subject. And secondly, we can't really go into it until we kind of start to say, what are we talking about here? Or can we decide what we're talking about, and see where that leads us<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > We need to know what we are talking about thus this talk" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#We need to know what we are talking about thus this talk" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^3-3

So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, as _we_ are using it on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, as _I_ would want to conceive of it, certainly has a relationship with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, with the notion of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. The notion of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and the notion of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> are clearly related. But let us say (and we can come back to this) that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is a _kind_ of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. It's still very wide, what it can mean, but it's a specific kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. So a subset of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span> are erotic <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span>, if you like. And <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, if it's not already clear to you or clear from the first few talks that we gave, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> is very interesting and not simple. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> is also not simple. I don't think we really went into this in the first three talks, but the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> lists, in these great lists that he comes up with (the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening > Factors of Awakening" data-href="Awakening#Factors of Awakening" class="internal-link">factors of awakening</a></span>, and this and that), there's a list called the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Four bases of power" class="internal-link">Four bases of power</a></span> - the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Four bases of power" class="internal-link">Four bases of power</a></span>, sometimes of power, or success, or accomplishment.^[SN 51:20] And <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> is one of those. It's listed, and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> talks about it a lot. If you want _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_, if you want to develop the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a></span>_, if you want to develop the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a></span>_, if you want <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> is a basis for that. He lists it and points to it: "This is necessary. It's important to develop this. It's important to give some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to this. It's important to be skilful with one's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>."

Anyone just flicking through the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a></span>, the collection of the original <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s teachings, how often words like 'striving' and 'exertion,' etc., come up. I've forgotten the exact Pali words, but he uses the language of 'striving,' of 'ardent <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>,' etc., really, _really_ frequently. If you take the example just of his life, he's a paradigm, a paramount example of someone _really_ dedicated, _really_ desiring, with what most people nowadays <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">in our culture</a></span> would regard as an extreme <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span> for, in his case, realization.

So, as I said, all this, what we're talking about on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and the teachings about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, has a context. Now, there are also the contexts of areas and themes in the teachings that have interested me very much over the years, and that I have tried to share with others over the years as well. I've talked in the past - I think, if I remember, there's a talk called "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Passion, Desire, and the Path" class="internal-link">Passion, Desire, and the Path</a></span>"^[Rob Burbea, "Passion, Desire, and the Path" (16 March 2007), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/12343]; one was about "A <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Wise Relationship to Practice" class="internal-link">Wise Relationship to Practice</a></span>,"^[Rob Burbea, "A Wise Relationship to Practice" (28 Jan. 2010), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/9538] I think it's called; and "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Wise Effort" class="internal-link">Wise Effort</a></span>,"^[Rob Burbea, "Talk Three: Wise Effort and Wise Attachment" (10 Aug. 2008), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/11516] looking at more the micro-movement of effort and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> in, for example, _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="samatha" class="internal-link">samatha</a></span>_ practice and _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a></span>_ practice and that kind of thing; and other talks I can't remember.

I've talked about that before. Very interesting: the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">passion for the path</a></span>, or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">passion on the path</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">passion for awakening</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> to unfold certain experiences and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span>, and how that comes into _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ practice and _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice and all that. On this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> I also want to go into that, but specifically, also, _why._ Here's a question that, to me, is interesting, and I'm going to reflect on this, as it's wrapped up in what we're talking about: _why_ is it that some people have a great <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span> and choose a path, or, if you say, a _version_ of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Buddhadharma</a></span>, that allows a great <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span> for realization, for deep experiences, deep <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, deep openings of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Passion for the Path" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Passion for the Path" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^4-3
###### 4-4
Why is it that some people have that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span> and choose a version, among the different versions that are sort of on the spiritual supermarket shelf even within <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span>, choose a version of it that allows their <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>, and even allows the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> that can come with that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>? It's a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> talked about. I can't remember his word for it, but the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> of the contemplative, I think he called it, in a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sutta" class="internal-link">sutta</a></span> somewhere in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Pali Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a></span> about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>.^[MN 137] He doesn't say, in regard to the meditator, the contemplative, who hears about other people <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>, who wants <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> but is not there yet, he doesn't say, "Just relax. Let go. Don't <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. Drop it. Too much <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>." He doesn't say that. He said, "Yeah, that's how it is until you realize. What you need to do is keep going until you realize. Then your <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span> will be quenched."^[SN 51:15] So it's oftentimes quite a different message that we're getting, or interpretation that we're putting on the teachings<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > The contemplative painfully longs for awakening" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#The contemplative painfully longs for awakening" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-4

Why is it that some have this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>, and some choose a version that allos that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span> even when it's painful, and some don't? Some don't seem either to have that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>, or move away, choose a version where it just bypasses, if you like, or tranquillizes or deflates that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>. Some choose a path or a version of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> where actually not a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span> is needed - the vision, the notion or idea or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy of awakening</a></span> involved is actually not that remarkable. It's almost something for your spare time, if you like. It's not really a big deal. It's quite a small vision of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>. And some people don't seem to have an interest or a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, there's not much libido, if you like, towards <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> in general. They don't talk about it. They don't listen to talks that mention it. When it's talked about, they'll just lose interest. They'll actually say - I've heard many people say to me, "I'm just not interested." So that's interesting, too, to me. Why? What's going on there? What's going on, either in relation to those notions, or in relation to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, or in relation to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, etc., to the notion of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Why seem others not really interested in awakening" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Why seem others not really interested in awakening" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^4-5

Some have, on the contrary, a very high bar for what <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> means. And when I place myself in a more traditional sort of interpretation of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, I would say where I set the bar for what <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> means is really quite high in relationship to where others set it, in terms of what <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="stream-entry" class="internal-link">stream-entry</a></span> is and all that stuff, if you know those terms. And some people (and again, I would also include myself) sort of at the edge of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> would even conceive of an endlessly expanding - not quite receding, but endlessly expanding - notion of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>. So in talks like "In Praise of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Restlessness</a></span>"^[Rob Burbea, "In Praise of Restlessness" (25 Nov. 2014), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/26009] I've talked about this, and "Questioning <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Awakening</a></span>,"^[Rob Burbea, "Questioning Awakening" (12 Nov. 2014), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/26010] and other talks.^[E.g. Rob Burbea, "What is Awakening?" [Parts 1-4] (5-8 Jan. 2018), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=what+is+awakening+mirrored+gates] So the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> is always there. The flame of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> never goes out, because there's always more. There's always a greater expansion. There's always more depth and diversity and range to what <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> is and can be. There are always new horizons of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> opening up<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > High bar in Theravada; for Rob its an endlessly expanding notion of awakening" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#High bar in Theravada; for Rob it's an endlessly expanding notion of awakening" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1

So why? Why all these differences in people? Is it just differences of personality? <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul-differences</a></span>, if you like? Is it conditioning, whether that's in terms of personality, or education, or what people have been exposed to, the kinds of teachings, or the kind of culture, or the kind of family? Is it early childhood wounding, for example - that in how one expressed one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span> and one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, the nakedness of that that the infant has, often that comes out quite uninhibited in infancy? Is it that there was a wounding there, in school, or with the family, or whatever it is, that caused one to block and inhibit one's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, one's libido, one's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>? All of this, actually, we're going to talk about more. To me, these are interesting questions, the psychology involved in all of this: why some people are like that, why others different, why people go for this kind of path, or that kind of path, or that kind of notion of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>, or whatever it is. I want to include it over the course of this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> very much. We'll return to that periodically<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Why people go for this kind of path or that kind of path or that kind of notion of awakening" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Why people go for this kind of path or that kind of path or that kind of notion of awakening" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2

In the past (I think a few years ago), I gave a couple of talks called "The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">Beauty</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a></span>," Part 1 and 2, I think.^[Rob Burbea, "The Beauty of Desire" [Parts 1 and 2] (19 and 26 Nov. 2011), [https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=the+beauty+of+desire](https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=the+beauty+of+desire)] And if I remember, in the second part of that, I introduced something that I discovered in practice, where there's a certain way of practising with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> - even if it's a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> not for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>, for something else - where it might at first be uncomfortable and bring _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, but there's a way of practising that doesn't dissolve it, that respects it, opens it up more. Practising in that way, actually respecting the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> and, if you like, empowering it - without necessarily acting on it; we're talking about a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> here - practising this way leads to an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> where the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> does not bring _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>._ Quite the opposite: it brings a kind of fulfilment and opening of the being. So again, the whole way we tend to think about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, and even if it's a good thing, it inherently brings some degree of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> because there's tension - not so simple, not so simple. We'll be revisiting and actually elaborating more on that material as part of this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, as part of what we're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a></span> 'the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Alchemy" data-href="Alchemy" class="internal-link">alchemy of desire</a></span>.' ^5-3

In the first three talks, hopefully it was clear that the whole idea of trying to live a life of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">non-clinging</a></span>, trying to live without <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, "just <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a></span>," etc., in that simplistically understood way, has several problems, which I'm not going to repeat now. So that, too, is part of the context. And also, again, what we're talking about on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> is very much in the context of the exploration, the elaboration, and the expansion of what I've been <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span> (related to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tantra" data-href="Tantra" class="internal-link">tantric</a></span> practice, but different). I've talked a fair amount already about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> in the context of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>. One set of talks I remember - what's it called? - "An Ecology of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a></span>," in I think three or four parts^[Rob Burbea, "An Ecology of Love" [Parts 1-4] (21 Dec. 2015), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=an+ecology+of+love+sense+of+the+Earth] - talked about this dynamic which we're really, really going to elaborate on a lot in _this_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, because it's so central, such a powerful <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>, and it opens up all kinds of things, allows and gives a basis to all kinds of avenues, what I'm calling the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span> or the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking dynamic" data-href="Soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">eros-psyche-logos dynamic</a></span>. I will explain more about that on this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and bring everything back to that quite a bit, but it's already been explored. So again, that's part of the context through <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Parts of the context problems coming from wanting to live without clinging; imaginal practice" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Parts of the context problems coming from wanting to live without clinging; imaginal practice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-1

So that's a little bit of the context. But there's more, even, because we could say, why bother? Why introduce this other word, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, when we have lots of words, as we elaborated in part one of the first talk?

I was quite committed to the idea, until I fell in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> with a girl who came out of nowhere and dishevelled my whole world.

> Now, obviously, from the monk's perspective, this is the worst thing I could have done. But somehow I can't really buy into that. Not just because romance is so sweet and compelling, but mostly because of my intuition that there is something deeper running underneath lust and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, something wider than her and me, something so beautifully alive that maybe it shouldn't be renounced so quickly. It's that same intuition that flared up every time I have fallen in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>: the feeling that I'm playing a game that is beyond us; that the torrent in my chest is just running through me unaffected by matter or time, untamed by anybody; that I'm just here as a temporary vehicle for a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> that has never begun nor ceased stretching out towards the beloved, so my specific <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a></span> become just some personified renditions of a myth essentially unspoken and inexhaustible<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Perceiving oneself as a temporary vehicle for an eternal love" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Perceiving oneself as a temporary vehicle for an eternal love" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-5

So, beautiful, beautiful email. I was struck by this, of course, and moved, busy as I was at the time, moved to write back and suggest we arrange a time to speak. We spoke, but just for about an hour. That was actually all we had the chance to do before I got ill quite out of the blue, as well, and had to cut down on most of my teaching. He said while we were talking that, before falling in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> this time, he thought he had left all that behind him, and was now travelling a different path. I asked: "What's the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of that path?", and he mentioned <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hermit" data-href="Hermit" class="internal-link">the hermit</a></span> in solitude, in the peace of the woods or the mountains. I asked him, "Is it _peace_ you're after?" And he said, "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a></span> from ruts and from the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of engaging." There's a lot here. And we talked about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> sensibility, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>; what this meant about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span>, the possible plurality within <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span>; the possibility of regarding <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> as not just <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a></span> (as we touched on in the first talks). What else was there?

But we only could speak for an hour, and it's such a huge subject that all I could do was kind of give a few pointers, really, and suggest, I think, that we have some more contact at some point. There was another piece, actually, that this woman that he was involved with - this is part of the problem that initially instigated - this woman that he was involved with was wanting the relationship to be an open one (in other words, to be able to have sex with other people, etc.), that they both were okay with that. She wanted that, and he was very unsure about that, and very ambivalent about that. But I just pointed out to him that actually, although that's certainly an issue to explore and to ponder, whether it ended up being an open relationship or not, and even whether the relationship continued or ended, is actually _not_ the most deeply relevant thing<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > There was insecurity about the relationship being an open one" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#There was insecurity about the relationship being an open one" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-2
###### 8-3
The more fundamental and universal questions he was asking in all this, they won't go away whether or not the relationship's open, or whether or not it continued. So when we say "why bother with all this?", well, that email articulates really, really well one of the reasons. It wasn't enough; the contact we had was not enough to really allow those kind of questions and the wrestling that he's talking about to really be opened up and supported. And hence this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and hence the teachings on this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and the attempt here, because usually in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> - that's the tradition he's coming from - in terms of sexual <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> and energies that arise, you know, as we talked about, either they're just regarded essentially as _kilesa_, defilement, or distraction in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>. Or there's a sort of slightly more charitable and open, softer view that just says: notice them, allow them, certainly don't encourage them. So notice, allow, in this spirit of openness, but not the encouragement. Sexual and erotic-<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> and energies are _not_ regarded as having any real positive place on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>; only so much in the context that _anything_ has a place on <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> because we're attempting, in a certain framing or vision of what <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> is, to be open to all things. Still, underneath that (this is the subtext), we can be open to all things, but it's _better_ if these things don't arise. It's easier, and basically just kind of let go of them. Maybe there's a kind of view of equality: "They're just like anything else to be opened to, to be let go of." But essentially it's like everything else: don't <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a></span>, don't get involved, don't create anything there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > In the Insight Meditation tradition sexual energies better not arise" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#In the Insight Meditation tradition sexual energies better not arise" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-3

So <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span>, one of its strengths is how much emphasis it puts on the feet. How many times have you heard _that_ <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span>? <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Walking meditation</a></span>, the feet on the ground, standing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>, groundedness, "Can you feel your bum on the cushion?", etc. Really, really important. And how much emphasis also in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> - again, one of its <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Beauty" data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">beauties</a></span>, one of its strengths - on the heart: the openness of the heart, the capacities of the heart, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a></span> and the centrality of the heart. And more and more in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> circles there's an emphasis on what we could call the head, in the sense of - slowly, a few strands within the broader <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> tradition - really emphasizing study of the texts, etc. So feet, heart, and head. Other bits might be missing. [laughs] Can it involve our hips? Feet, heart, head, hips<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Feet heart head hips" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Feet heart head hips" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^9-1

So again, there's a kind of lacuna there, certainly around <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span> and that kind of erotics. But I really want to say, when _we_ use the word <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, it _includes_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span> in what we're meaning by <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. So we include <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span>. We include sexual attraction, sexual <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, etc. But it's actually much, much more than that. We're talking about something much more fundamental, and also that can be both very intense and very subtle. Well, sexual <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> and sexual attraction can also be very subtle, but even more subtle than that. We're talking about something, as a notion, that's actually more basic and often more subtle<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Our definition of eros includes sexuality but its more fundamental and often more subtle" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Our definition of eros includes sexuality but it's more fundamental and often more subtle" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-2
###### 9-3
But again, you know, not to over-labour the point, but why introduce this concept of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>? Why distinguish something called '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>' from <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> or greed or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> in general? Well, it's there already. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span>, as _we're_ meaning that term, what _we_ mean by <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, is already functioning every day in our lives. {It's already part of our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, as we'll explain. Making the distinction draws out something that otherwise might not be so clear to us.} And, as I said, that might shut doors if it's not so clear, if we don't draw it out. Making a distinction, or any kind of distinction, amplifies something. By distinguishing this from that, A from B, A and B get amplified, or one of A and B gets amplified, gets magnified. It's like you get to put it under a magnifying glass. It gets clearer. Setting it apart allows us to investigate it, to take it as a theme of investigation. If I don't <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">delineate</a></span> it in the first place, I can't take it as a theme of investigation<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > 1 Because eros is already active in our life and by delineating it we get a handle on it" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#1 Because eros is already active in our life and by delineating it we get a handle on it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-3
###### 9-4
The delineation is the beginning of opening something up, like a - what would an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> be? I'm not sure if this would work as an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, but like a tear, or like getting your foot in the door, you can begin then to pry open the door, or tearing a fabric, a veil, to reveal something. Setting it apart allows us to investigate it, to become interested in it, and then we can see how it works. What is this thing? How does it work? And where does it lead, this thing that we're going to call <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>? Because, and this is one of our central contentions, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> will lead to different experiences, to different ends, than <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> leads to. It leads to ends and experiences other than the ones <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> leads to. It opens up, if you like, regions of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, to use a certain language. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> is very connected with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span>, with what we're going to call '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>.' I'll explain more what we mean by that, but for now, let's just say the widening and deepening of a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span>, the widening and deepening and diversification of our sense of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span>. But also this word, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, has much to do with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meaningfulness" class="internal-link">meaningfulness</a></span>, and resonance, and depth, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>, and all kinds of things. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> is connected with a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sense of divinity</a></span>, and with what we've been <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a></span> in past <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a></span>: the very sense we have, the vision, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, of the world, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmos</a></span> we live in, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmos</a></span> about us, our very sense of existence.

###### 10-1
So that's one reason. It's in our life already, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. We already <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> it. We just need to draw it out and investigate it and see where it leads, because it _does_ lead to somewhere other than where what we might call '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>' leads to. A second reason why, why make this delineation, is to hopefully establish, or at least highlight the potential of, opening to a recognition of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> itself. Again, this is something we're going to come back to a lot: the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> itself. We can see that, and it's very different to see <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> as sacred rather than as a defilement. And that includes also the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span>, or at least the potential <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span>, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">Sacredness</a></span> never resides in this or that object or thing; we sacralize. We make something or other sacred through our relationship with it. So there's the possibility of sacralizing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span>, rather than just viewing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span> as a defilement, or as leading inevitably to defilement<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > 2 Opening to the recognition of the sacredness of eros itself" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#2 Opening to the recognition of the sacredness of eros itself" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-1

All this, as I said, is not really so adequately addressed in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> at present, for the most part. We talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. We talk a lot about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, but in a negative way mostly. We talk about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span>, but very little, except in terms of ethical prohibitions - for example, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="precepts" class="internal-link">precepts</a></span> - or it's admitted, within sort of typically assumed limits, that it's an aspect of life (predominately lay life, but still there for monastics). But there isn't really this exploration, inquiry. It's not really opened up, as I said, as part of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>. As we mentioned already at least once, you know, most people have a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="romantic love" class="internal-link">romantic love</a></span>, or most people are involved in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span>, or in marriages, perhaps, and a finer discrimination is needed there. This is not _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ .

There's something more involved, or that needs to be involved. Part of that 'more' is what we're going to call <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, what we're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. If I'm interested in that, if I'm really interested in bringing a fullness of investigation, and if I'm really interested in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="romantic love" class="internal-link">romantic love</a></span> and romantic partnerships being really integrally part of the practice, then this brings all kinds of inquiries. For example, in a long-term relationship, what keeps the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> alive? What stifles it? What kills it? What erodes it? What just allows it to fritter away? And what keeps the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> alive in a long-term relationship<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > All this is not really adequately addressed in the Dharma at present" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#All this is not really adequately addressed in the Dharma at present" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^10-2

So there's that second reason, the re-sacralizing of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, but also of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, and making it more part of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>, integrally, fully, richly. Really, with all this, a third reason why, what are we doing, why make this discrimination of something called <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, is related to what I said before: I'm interested in creating or opening an area or a direction of investigation. I certainly don't want to just sort of, for instance, _assert_ something like the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>: "I am telling you <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is sacred," and then, you know, so what? Some people will agree, some people will disagree. It's pointless. What I'm much more interested in is a domain and a dimension for a much freer, more open and penetrating inquiry, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> inquiry. And always in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> inquiry, always, there's something really fundamental to see: there's a principle that how we view something - always we see that how we view something affects the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of that 'something.' The ideas that I have, the preconceptions, the conceptions, the relationship with the 'something' that I'm investigating, the area of inquiry, affects my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of that 'something,' and affects the related experiences that unfold, that can unfold, or that will unfold. All that's to do with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span>. The view, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, affects. It shapes the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. We've talked about that. It's part of what we talked about before<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > 3 Opening a direction of investigation" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#3 Opening a direction of investigation" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-3
###### 11-1
We really have to see this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span>. How I view something affects my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of that thing, so that must be part of the way that I'm inquiring. And a part of that, a part of the investigation, is perhaps this question: what happens, how does it affect this whole thing called <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, if I view it as sacred? Even if I just _try_ and view it, even just a little, just entertain the idea that it might be sacred? So that's a sort of subset of a subset of the investigation: what happens _if_ ? I'm not asserting anything here. This is all really in the spirit of investigation<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > How does it affect the thing called eros if I view it as sacred" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#How does it affect the thing called eros if I view it as sacred" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-1

And I'll say it one more time [laughs]: _we_ mean by '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>' something including, but much more than, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span>, much more than sexual attraction or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, or sexual interactions between people. You can have, there exists, there arises for us, an erotic connection or erotic connections (plural) with the earth; with a tree, or a piece of land; with the stars; with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmos</a></span>; erotic connection with the divine; erotic connection/relationship with the senses; an erotic sensibility, an erotic connection with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Materialism" data-href="Materialism" class="internal-link">materiality</a></span>; certainly with another <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>, but not only humans - with other living beings. Certainly also not just with others, but we can have - and hopefully we _do_ have, and we're going to elaborate on this - an erotic connection with oneself, or erotic connections (plural) with oneself and aspects of oneself, faces of oneself, or the selves' faces, or self faces, whatever. There can be and hopefully is an erotic view, an erotic connection, with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>, and with the idea, or the vision, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span>, the notion, the concept of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>. Certainly always there's an erotic connection with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figures</a></span>, even when it seems like there isn't. And there's even the possibility of erotic connection with ideas and concepts<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > You can have an erotic connection with everything and anything" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#You can have an erotic connection with everything and anything" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-2
###### 11-3
So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> pervades very broadly. We mean much more than '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span>' here. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> can also be or can seem to be, at different times, primarily energetic, or primarily physical, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">embodied</a></span>, if you like, or primarily <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, or primarily intellectual. It can, at different times, be or seem to be primarily all those things. Actually, I would say it always involves all of these aspects. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> always involves <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, what we're going to call the '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>,' and the energetics; it involves some kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="embodiment" class="internal-link">embodiment</a></span>, or relationship with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and views of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of the body</a></span>; it always involves the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>; and it always involves ideation, intellect, concept, what we're going to call '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>.' It always involves all that. So it's already something multidimensional, and we're going to go into this more. As I said, whenever there is a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span>, that kind of richness, resonance, depth, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meaningfulness" class="internal-link">meaningfulness</a></span>, in our existence, in the being, whenever there is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span> in our existence, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is involved. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> is involved whenever there is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Eros involves energy embodiment the imaginal and logos" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Eros involves energy embodiment the imaginal and logos" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-3
###### 11-4
Now, I think it's fair to say, I think it's obvious and maybe important to say as well, that different people at different times will find these investigations that we're going into around <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> more or less interesting. So this, to me, is interesting in itself. It seems to me, it does seem to me, that people differ in the flavours or the characters, if you like, of the ways <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, or libido, or if we say <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Eros" data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">life force</a></span>, expresses in their lives. They differ in the flavours, the characters, the ways <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> expresses in their lives. The fire, if you like, if <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is a kind of fire, the fire of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> looks and burns differently. People's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>-fire burns and looks differently, one to another. There's quite a range there, you know - the flaming <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>. And also at different times, a flaming <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>, a very steady, quiet, small, but unquenchable flame; or the raging fire, whatever, leaping from one thing to another, the flames. It looks and burns differently<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Different people different characters also how eros expresses in their lives" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Different people different characters also how eros expresses in their lives" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-4
###### 12-1
But people also differ, it seems to me at least, in the amount, strength, and depth, if you like, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> or the libido that flows through them in their life or into them. Differ in the amount, strength, or depth. So this also is complex. Some people are like this, and some people are like that. There's a range. But it's also a fact (we touched on this before) that, for all kinds of reasons which also are interesting, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and libido or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Eros" data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">life force</a></span> _can_ be and often _is_ blocked in our lives in different ways, inhibited at times or in certain situations, or certain expressions or along certain lines are blocked, whereas others are free. Or there can be a more chronic and more pervasive blocking or inhibition of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and the libido. It's not so much that person really, so to speak, _is_ just a certain character or style; something is blocking or inhibited, or crushed or whatever, there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > People also different in the strength and depth of eros itself" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#People also different in the strength and depth of eros itself" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-1
###### 12-2
Still, despite all that, and despite the varying differences of interest between different people at different times and all that, I'd say that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is a necessary, an integral aspect or element of what we're going to be <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a></span> '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>,' what we have in the past called '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>.' And therefore, an inquiry into <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is important for anyone interested, at all interested or devoted to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. It's just part of what one needs to consider, and explore, and open up, and go into, and allow, and understand, and support, and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourish</a></span>, question<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Eros is a necessary part of soulmaking" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Eros is a necessary part of soulmaking" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-2

On this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, on this course, the intention of the teachings is really, if you like, to open a door, or open doors. I mentioned that it's possible that certain doors are actually shut or even locked shut in the way that we're conceiving - not just of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, but of life, of existence, and of who we are, and what the world is, and what existence is. So the aim, broadly speaking, of these teachings, this set of teachings, is to open doors, and to sketch - at least sketch, begin to sketch - a path for those who would move through these doors and move into new territory, for those who would like to travel certain paths, and to offer a map - at least the beginnings of a map, loosely speaking - a frame of reference, and light certain beacons for navigation for those also who already find themselves in uncharted territory around <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, around <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. They're already there, and they need some kind of orientation, some kind of way of thinking and ways of practising, practical tools, subtleties of practical differentiations and navigation and steering, as all practices need<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > On this retreat the intention is to open doors and offer a map" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#On this retreat the intention is to open doors and offer a map" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-3

Some, as we mentioned, already see that maybe the more usual or narrow sort of ways we can interpret the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understandings</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, or frameworks, may not be enough, or _are_ not enough, to open up this territory. Some people already sense - as in the beautiful email I read earlier - already sense a holiness in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, the holiness of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> in life or in certain areas or directions of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. And also in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>, this is very common. They sense that holiness, but it's tricky. It's tricky, and not easy, and it's complex, and it's rich, and help is needed, and a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span> is needed, and tools are needed, and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a></span>, and practice instructions are needed, etc. - both on the cushion, and in life, and in relationship<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > The sense of the holiness of desire is tricky so help is needed" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#The sense of the holiness of desire is tricky so help is needed" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-4

Again, back to context: these teachings sit within a larger context of wanting to open a path that integrates a lot of elements that we've already talked about over the last few years - <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a></span>, this re-enchantment of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmos</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="poetry" class="internal-link">poetry</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, the experiences and the senses of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span>, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. All this we touched before, and in fact, I'm going to - probably in the next talk - attempt a kind of brief glossary of all these terms. Hopefully that's helpful too. This <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, as I said, is a slightly different angle. It's coming from the angle of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, emphasizing more the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, and expanding on more what that means.

It sits with that, alongside, mixed with that, in complement to that, and also the much more radical teachings about investigating <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and the whole spectrum of what that notion, that word, means, '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>,' and all the subtleties and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Beauty" data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">beauties</a></span> of working with that in practice: <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, moving up and down the spectrum of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, and seeing what it does to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self, other, world, time</a></span>, etc., really going deeply in practice and in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, in the realization, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, into the teachings of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dependent origination" class="internal-link">dependent origination</a></span> at a very deep level - not the more common level; the very deep level - and unfolding, if you like, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of all things</a></span>, so that existence is opened, and radical <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>, radical opening of the sense of existence.

So that to the degree, to the depth that we kind of have taken to heart, understood the teachings of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, how much they've penetrated the heart and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, to that degree we can really practise a flexibility of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>, and also of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a></span>.

It's woven into, integrated - these teachings are integrated into the usual <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma teachings</a></span> about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> and releasing _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, and the much deeper teachings about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, and that forms a non-realist basis. All that is partly what allows us to open up teachings of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span> and, if you like, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tantra" data-href="Tantra" class="internal-link">tantric</a></span> teachings - although I make a distinction there, but <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="tantra" class="internal-link">tantra</a></span> _is_ based on that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, absolutely.

So all this is integrated together, and as I mentioned, there are other possibilities through <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>, and through the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, of having what I would call a fuller, more adequate concept and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self, other, world</a></span>, etc., existence - ways of relating and seeing and experiencing all that that are more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a></span>, more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, conducive to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, that widen and diversify our sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span>, open our senses of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > This results in a more adquate concept and perceptions of self other world" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#This results in a more adquate concept and perceptions of self other world" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-3

So I hope you can see in all of this, and if not right now, at least at some point, you can see that this isn't really an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eclecticism" class="internal-link">eclecticism</a></span>. I'm not sort of interested in just drawing different things together, tossing them in a pot for the sake of being interesting, or just being restless in a more superficial way. I hope you can see at some point how integrated, as I said, all these teachings are and, if you like, how necessary, how inevitable many of these teachings are, because, as I said, one way of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> unfolds a certain depth and a certain possibility, and that just keeps unfolding in a kind of very necessary way. So they're necessary to what's gone before, but also necessary to our existence and to our practice and for the future<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Its not eclecticism but integrated into an inevitable way the Dharma unfolds" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#It's not eclecticism but integrated into an inevitable way the Dharma unfolds" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-4

Maybe more typical <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> psychologies - let's say just the teaching of the links of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dependent origination" class="internal-link">dependent origination</a></span>; we talked a bit about that. One of the immense strengths of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s teaching and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma teaching</a></span> is that he kind of gives us a set of concepts, and in a way, they become <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>. That's what these concepts are; they become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>. But they serve to simplify. So <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> concepts serve to simplify, simplify because they <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricate</a></span> less. When I use a certain set of concepts, for instance, there's less _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_ . There's less of this crazy complexifying and nonsense-making, if you like, entanglement. But at a deeper level, too, they simplify in the sense that the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> concepts become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span> that move towards less and less <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>, and less and less <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> is a state of simplicity. He's saying, "Don't think about _this_ . Don't think about _that_ . Think in this way, and look in this way. Adopt these <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>," and there's a disentangling, a certain amount of simplifying - both of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span> (by constraining the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span> to certain concepts), but also then in what is seen, of course. There's a simplifying in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of things. And that simplifying just goes deeper and deeper. So not just the simplicity of the 'is-ness,' the so-called '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness > Suchness" data-href="Emptiness#Suchness" class="internal-link">suchness</a></span>' of things and the vividness of that, but the simplicity of our life, and then the simplicity of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> _beyond_ the thing-ness of things, as we go deeper and deeper into unfabricating, and eventually into something that is, in effect, so simple that even 'is' or 'is not' doesn't apply to it: the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Dharma concepts aim towards less papanca" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Dharma concepts aim towards less papanca" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-1

So again, if I use a certain language, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>, wants and needs, obviously, a kind of disentangling. It certainly wants that journey into perceiving less <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. But there are, so to speak, other <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span> or strata of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> (we could use that language), of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>, that want something else. And so other <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="delineations" class="internal-link">delineations</a></span> become necessary, rather than just simplicity, simplicity, simplicity, unfabricating, unfabricating, unfabricating, unfabricating, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a></span>. Rather than just the simplifying of that direction, which is so much the power of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma practice</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> concepts, other <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a></span>, other <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="delineations" class="internal-link">delineations</a></span>, become necessary. What is the difference between _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_ and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> in the way _we're_ using it?

What's the difference between <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>?

I'm going to make this contention (it's something I'm really going to come back to a lot on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>): something in us, something in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, wants to know, wants to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, not just <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>, not just transcendence or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a></span>, nor just (quote) 'life as it is,' as if there really even _is_ a 'life as it is,' as if such a thing exists, such a thing is possible to behold. We don't _just_ want <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>, transcendence, or that freshness of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Attention" data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">bare attention</a></span>, certainly. We want more, even, than all that - certainly more than the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Attention" data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">bare attention</a></span>, I hope, but also more than a dissolution in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>, and also more than transcendence or the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a></span>, even that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > We dont just want oneness etc but more than that" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#We don't just want oneness etc but more than that" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-3

So we need a kind of more elaborate, you could say, or a slightly more sophisticated psychology. We need a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> psychology that both recognizes that which is already present, but which needs to be, as I said, drawn out, amplified a little more, recognized - the fact, for example, that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is more than _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ ; it's not the same as <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>; it's not even just <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">hitacchanda</a></span>,_ or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> that leads to less <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. We need to recognize something that's already present in our life, that hasn't been drawn <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to yet, highlighted, drawn out, investigated. And we need a slightly more elaborate <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> psychology because of the different kinds of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span> and the different realms of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> which are slightly more involved. A psychology that involves concepts like <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> can open up for us, without which either these realms don't open up, these directions don't open up, or they just get dismissed<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > We need a more sophisticated Dharma psychology" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#We need a more sophisticated Dharma psychology" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-4
