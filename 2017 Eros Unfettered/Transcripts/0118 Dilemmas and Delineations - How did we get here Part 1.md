[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1]]

---
<br/>

###### 1-1
This is really a [[retreat]], a course, on the theme, on the subject, exploring the themes of [[eros]] and [[desire]] and the [[Alchemy|alchemy of desire]]. I want to take a little time now, over the next few talks, to begin to [[Delineations|delineate]] what _we_ mean when we use this word, '<span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>.' So to begin to do that. As you'll quickly see, the way we're using that word is actually woven in with a whole web, if you like, a whole dynamic web of other words that we're using quite specifically - related ideas, related notions, related experiences. So we'll have to kind of gradually unfold all this, unpack it, if you like, or gradually (reverse analogy) build a framework, an architecture that will help us here, build our ship or our vehicle[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#We will gradually unfold the semantic web of "eros"|.]] ^1-1
###### 1-2
In the course of doing that, and explaining or unpacking a little bit - 'elaborating' is a better word - elaborating a bit on, gradually, what we mean by '[[eros]],' and what it involves, what it implies, etc., where it goes, in the course of delineating, the question comes up: why? Why [[Delineations|delineate]]? We touched on that briefly already, but there's actually more to say. Why make this extra delineation of something called <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>? Because we have a lot of words, like we said. We have [[desire]], [[craving]], [[clinging]], attachment, [[love]], you know. So why make this extra delineation? I want to say a bit more about that. And I also want to weave into all this just some reflections on making [[delineations]] and definitions in general. So some general reflections on that, because actually it is very relevant to the whole project that we're doing and where it can go[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Why delineate|.]] ^1-2
###### 1-3
So, you know, unless you teach in some way or other, in some subject or art or whatever it is, it may not be obvious to you, but it's obvious to me that teaching is always, _always_ contextual. In talking about [[eros]] now, there is the context. There's a double context, at least. One is the context of: how did we get here? What is it that led up to these kind of [[delineations]], and making the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="delineations" href="delineations" class="internal-link">delineations</a></span> and the justifications and the explanations that we're about to go into slowly, gradually? That comes out of a whole trajectory, a whole progression of exploration and [[insight]] that, in a way, one thing led to the other, one thing unfolded another. So there's the context of where we're coming from. And, in a way - I'll go into this later - I'm coming from a background in [[Meditation|Insight Meditation]], but a certain way of [[Insight|understanding]] and approaching what <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> is, and what the [[Dharma]] is, and how to think of that[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Teaching is always contextual|.]] ^1-3
###### 1-4
But there's also the context of who one is talking to, who one is teaching, and the context in which one teaches. So that teaching about [[eros]] and [[desire]], and shining a different light on them in a Buddhist context and in an [[Meditation|Insight Meditation]] context, _is_ a certain context. It's not necessarily the easiest or most straightforward context to raise these issues and hope to bring some fresh illumination or fresh turning of the earth, if you like. There are other contexts, for instance in - I don't know - psychotherapeutic contexts or philosophical contexts where, in a way, it would be much more straightforward. There would still be [[Delineations|distinctions]] and things to make. But in some ways, the context that we're in makes it more challenging, but also we're lent certain advantages, I think, by our practice and by our [[Insight|understanding]], that other disciplines and directions don't have[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Our context is Buddhist insight meditation|.]] ^1-4
###### 2-1
About the context: I remember an international meeting of [[Meditation|Insight Meditation]] teachers in 2009, I think it was. It actually took place at [[Gaia House]]. It happens every, I don't know, three years? Something like that. Three or four years. It kind of rotates between three, maybe four centres - IMS, and Spirit Rock, and maybe Beatenberg; I can't remember - around the world. That year, it was at <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Gaia House" href="Gaia+House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a></span>, and maybe eighty <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> teachers. I can't remember. Very senior ones, all the way down to very, very new teachers. And they're from all over the world - well, actually, mostly Europe and America, USA. So part of that group, we had three or four days together, I think, and there were different discussion groups that were sort of offered. Periodically we would break, and certain themes would be offered, and then the people interested in _this_ theme would go and make a little group and discuss it for a while, and people interested in another theme would go and make their little group and discuss it[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#International meeting of Insight Meditation teachers Gaia House 2005|.]] ^2-1
###### 2-2
One day, one of the themes that was offered was [[eros]]. There are a couple of things to me that are interesting about what happened. One is that it was _by far_ [laughs] the biggest discussion group. So there was enormous interest in that topic, so much so that actually I think the group of people, the sub-group of the larger group that were interested in <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and elected to go into _that_ group, had to be divided into three to make them manageable discussions and interesting and worthwhile[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Eros was the biggest breakout group|.]] ^2-2
###### 2-3
So I was in a group that I think had at least ten people in it, and there were maybe two others like that. That was the first thing: look how much interest there was in this topic in Buddhist practitioners, Buddhist teachers, [[Meditation|Insight Meditation]] teachers, already in 2009. Partly it's because so little is said about it in our tradition. So that was the first thing that was interesting. The second thing to me that was interesting was, we gathered in our group of, let's say, ten people (I can't remember), ten teachers, and a few of us, several of us, said, "Hold on. Before we get into this, can we actually just kind of say or agree what we mean by '[[eros]]'?" And immediately it became very apparent that there was no common [meaning]. We had come to this group with quite a large range of what people thought '<span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>' meant, or what it meant to them. No one was particularly attached to "it means this" or anything like that, but there was really not a clarity or a common, shared meaning, even[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#There was no common definition of Eros|.]] ^2-3
###### 2-4
I remember one teacher just seemed to equate it with [[desire]] in general. If I understood her correctly, she was saying that her approach to this was - again, not very conventional [[Dharma]], but it's more like, let the students have their [[Desire|desires]]. So if you want that chocolate cake, have the chocolate cake. If you want this or that, have it. And in having it, and feeling it, and exploring it, and going into that [[experience]], over time (this was the theory) their <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span> would mature. And so instead of being caught up with superficial and kind of unhelpful <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span>, there would be this maturation through actually going into the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, living it, experiencing, tasting, etc. Following the thread of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, there would be this maturation until they would get clear and centred on their deepest heart's <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span>. So starting with the Mars bars, and eating them and whatever, eventually there would be this funnelling down, a natural maturation process that would happen. Now, that's probably not a fair summary of what she was saying, and I might have misunderstood. But anyway, she seemed to equate [[eros]] and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Some equated eros with desire|.]] ^2-4
###### 2-5
Another teacher made the distinction saying, "This is all very well, [[eros]]" (this was a little later in the group), saying, "what _I'm_ more interested in is in [[Thanatos]]_,_" he said. '<span class="transcript"><a data-href="Thanatos" href="Thanatos" class="internal-link">Thanatos</a></span>,' some of you will know, is another Greek word. '[[Eros]]' is a Greek word. And in, I think it's Freudian psychoanalytic theory, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Eros" href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> is sometimes equated with the life instinct (the instinct to want to live), and contrasted with <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Thanatos" href="Thanatos" class="internal-link">Thanatos</a></span> (the drive towards [[death]], the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="death" href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> instinct), which [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] introduced later into his psychoanalytic theory. This teacher was saying, interestingly, he came to the group to hold the other pole, if you like: "I'm interested in <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Thanatos" href="Thanatos" class="internal-link">Thanatos</a></span>, in the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="death" href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> instinct." I don't think he meant <span class="transcript"><a data-href="death" href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, per se; more as in [[Unfabricated|the Unfabricating]] that we were talking about, the movement towards a kind of dissolution, _nibbāna_, in the traditional sense[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#One was more interested in Thanatos|.]] ^2-5
###### 3-1
Related, but very different to that (and I can't remember what order this happened in) - there were quite a few senior teachers in this group, by the way - another teacher said that the [[Buddha]]'s primary interest, or he was trying to persuade people that the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Buddha" href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s primary interest was in addressing _[[Mara|Māra]]_, the sort of primordial, if you like, [[Archetype|archetypal]] villain in the [[Pali Canon]], _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mara" data-href="Mara" href="Mara" class="internal-link">Māra</a></span>_. And _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mara" data-href="Mara" href="Mara" class="internal-link">Māra</a></span>_ actually means '[[death]].' So the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Buddha" href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> was interested in _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mara" data-href="Mara" href="Mara" class="internal-link">amāra</a></span>_, which is also a word that's in the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Pali Canon" href="Pali+Canon" class="internal-link">Pali Canon</a></span> (less commonly, but it's there). _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mara" data-href="Mara" href="Mara" class="internal-link">Amāra</a></span>_, this teacher was saying, is in contrast to _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mara" data-href="Mara" href="Mara" class="internal-link">Māra</a></span>_ because it's a negation. _A-_ is _not_-death; therefore it means 'life.' So what the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Buddha" href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> is really teaching is "life, live, be in your life," etc., and the sort of elevation of - well, I actually pointed this out to him, but the elevation of this concept of Life, that it becomes a kind of substitute for an idea of God or divine, which this teacher was very much against. But there was this equation of [[eros]] with life, as opposed to <span class="transcript"><a data-href="death" href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, and the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Buddha" href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> was very interested in life, and the sort of praise of life, if you like[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Another equates Eros with life|.]] ^3-1
###### 3-2
It turned out that the person, I think, who even suggested the topic in general at first, when it came to her turn, what she meant by [[eros]], she was actually quite unclear and sort of said she didn't know. We sort of just tried to elicit from her a little bit, and it turned out that what she really meant was that when she was teaching, she found that she kind of got into a mode where there was very little humour and very little sort of joke-telling, etc. There was not the [[juiciness]] of humour. So that's what _she_ meant. This was a huge range, and I don't think [laughs] we even came to a conclusion about what we were talking about, which is oftentimes a problem with these kind of groups. But that was another thing that was interesting to me: that there was no clarity even about what is meant[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Yet another one meant "juiciness" - - there was no consensus|.]] ^3-2
###### 3-3
This is why, a little bit, I want to go into this - partly because it's a topic that people are interested in, and maybe especially people who have been practising a long time. Why? Because they recognize the lacuna there, the gap, presumably, in the teachings, around this subject. And secondly, we can't really go into it until we kind of start to say, what are we talking about here? Or can we decide what we're talking about, and see where that leads us[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#We need to know what we are talking about thus this talk|?]] ^3-3
###### 3-4
So [[eros]], as _we_ are using it on this [[retreat]], as _I_ would want to conceive of it, certainly has a relationship with [[desire]], with the notion of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. The notion of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and the notion of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> are clearly related. But let us say (and we can come back to this) that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is a _kind_ of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. It's still very wide, what it can mean, but it's a specific kind of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. So a subset of [[Desire|desires]] are erotic <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span>, if you like. And <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, if it's not already clear to you or clear from the first few talks that we gave, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> is very interesting and not simple. <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Desire" href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a></span> in the [[Dharma]] is also not simple. I don't think we really went into this in the first three talks, but the [[Buddha]] lists, in these great lists that he comes up with (the [[Awakening#Factors of Awakening|factors of awakening]], and this and that), there's a list called the [[Four bases of power]] - the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Four bases of power" href="Four+bases+of+power" class="internal-link">Four bases of power</a></span>, sometimes of power, or success, or accomplishment.^[SN 51:20] And <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> is one of those. It's listed, and the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Buddha" href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> talks about it a lot. If you want _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_, if you want to develop the _[[Jhanas|jhānas]]_, if you want to develop the _[[Brahmaviharas|brahmavihāras]]_, if you want [[awakening]], <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> is a basis for that. He lists it and points to it: "This is necessary. It's important to develop this. It's important to give some [[attention]] to this. It's important to be skilful with one's <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>." He does not say, "[[Letting go|Just let go]]. Do not [[Clinging|cling]]. Drop your <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span>," etc[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Desire is one of the Four Bases|.]] ^3-4
###### 4-1
Anyone just flicking through the [[Pali Canon]], the collection of the original [[Buddha]]'s teachings, how often words like 'striving' and 'exertion,' etc., come up. I've forgotten the exact Pali words, but he uses the language of 'striving,' of 'ardent [[desire]],' etc., really, _really_ frequently. If you take the example just of his life, he's a paradigm, a paramount example of someone _really_ dedicated, _really_ desiring, with what most people nowadays [[Dominant culture|in our culture]] would regard as an extreme [[passion]] for, in his case, realization. He taught the [[Middle Way]] between - well, actually different kinds of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Middle Way" href="Middle+Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span>, but his <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Middle Way" href="Middle+Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span> in terms of the [[Passion|passion for awakening]] was not really what most people these days would consider a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Middle Way" href="Middle+Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span>. It was quite extreme in terms of his dedication, his [[devotion]], his <span class="transcript"><a data-href="passion" href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>, his hunger and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> for realization, for [[awakening]][[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#The Buddha often uses "striving" etc |.]] ^4-1
###### 4-2
So, as I said, all this, what we're talking about on this [[retreat]], and the teachings about [[eros]] and [[desire]], has a context. Now, there are also the contexts of areas and themes in the teachings that have interested me very much over the years, and that I have tried to share with others over the years as well. I've talked in the past - I think, if I remember, there's a talk called "[[Passion, Desire, and the Path]]"^[Rob Burbea, "Passion, Desire, and the Path" (16 March 2007), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/12343]; one was about "A [[Wise Relationship to Practice]],"^[Rob Burbea, "A Wise Relationship to Practice" (28 Jan. 2010), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/9538] I think it's called; and "[[Wise Effort]],"^[Rob Burbea, "Talk Three: Wise Effort and Wise Attachment" (10 Aug. 2008), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/11516] looking at more the micro-movement of effort and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> in, for example, _[[samatha]]_ practice and _[[Jhanas|jhāna]]_ practice and that kind of thing; and other talks I can't remember. I think I might try on this <span class="transcript"><a data-href="retreat" href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> and do something that might be a little annoying, but hopefully it's more helpful than annoying, and mention other places where you can find more about certain strands or elements of teaching that are involved in what we're talking about. I'm going to mention, but maybe not fill out more, so that if you want more you have a place to look[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Other talks|.]] ^4-2
###### 4-3
I've talked about that before. Very interesting: the [[Passion|passion for the path]], or <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" href="Passion" class="internal-link">passion on the path</a></span>, the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" href="Passion" class="internal-link">passion for awakening</a></span>, the [[desire]] to unfold certain experiences and [[Insight|insights]], and how that comes into _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ practice and _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice and all that. On this [[retreat]] I also want to go into that, but specifically, also, _why._ Here's a question that, to me, is interesting, and I'm going to reflect on this, as it's wrapped up in what we're talking about: _why_ is it that some people have a great [[passion]] and choose a path, or, if you say, a _version_ of [[Dharma|Buddhadharma]], that allows a great <span class="transcript"><a data-href="passion" href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span> for realization, for deep experiences, deep [[insight]], deep openings of [[consciousness]][[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Passion for the Path|?]] ^4-3
###### 4-4
Why is it that some people have that [[passion]] and choose a version, among the different versions that are sort of on the spiritual supermarket shelf even within [[Meditation|Insight Meditation]], choose a version of it that allows their <span class="transcript"><a data-href="passion" href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>, and even allows the [[pain]] that can come with that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="passion" href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>? It's a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="pain" href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> the [[Buddha]] talked about. I can't remember his word for it, but the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="pain" href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> of the contemplative, I think he called it, in a [[sutta]] somewhere in the [[Pali Canon]] about [[equanimity]].^[MN 137] He doesn't say, in regard to the meditator, the contemplative, who hears about other people [[awakening]], who wants <span class="transcript"><a data-href="awakening" href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> but is not there yet, he doesn't say, "Just relax. Let go. Don't [[desire]]. Drop it. Too much <span class="transcript"><a data-href="passion" href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>." He doesn't say that. He said, "Yeah, that's how it is until you realize. What you need to do is keep going until you realize. Then your <span class="transcript"><a data-href="passion" href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span> will be quenched."^[SN 51:15] So it's oftentimes quite a different message that we're getting, or interpretation that we're putting on the teachings[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#The contemplative painfully longs for awakening|.]] ^4-4
###### 4-5
Why is it that some have this [[passion]], and some choose a version that allos that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="passion" href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span> even when it's painful, and some don't? Some don't seem either to have that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="passion" href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>, or move away, choose a version where it just bypasses, if you like, or tranquillizes or deflates that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="passion" href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>. Some choose a path or a version of the [[Dharma]] where actually not a lot of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="passion" href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span> is needed - the vision, the notion or idea or [[Fantasy|fantasy of awakening]] involved is actually not that remarkable. It's almost something for your spare time, if you like. It's not really a big deal. It's quite a small vision of [[awakening]]. And some people don't seem to have an interest or a [[desire]], there's not much libido, if you like, towards <span class="transcript"><a data-href="awakening" href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> in general. They don't talk about it. They don't listen to talks that mention it. When it's talked about, they'll just lose interest. They'll actually say - I've heard many people say to me, "I'm just not interested." So that's interesting, too, to me. Why? What's going on there? What's going on, either in relation to those notions, or in relation to [[the self]], or in relation to <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, etc., to the notion of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Why seem others not really interested in awakening|?]] ^4-5
###### 5-1
Some have, on the contrary, a very high bar for what [[awakening]] means. And when I place myself in a more traditional sort of interpretation of [[Dharma]], I would say where I set the bar for what <span class="transcript"><a data-href="awakening" href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> means is really quite high in relationship to where others set it, in terms of what [[stream-entry]] is and all that stuff, if you know those terms. And some people (and again, I would also include myself) sort of at the edge of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> would even conceive of an endlessly expanding - not quite receding, but endlessly expanding - notion of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="awakening" href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>. So in talks like "In Praise of [[Hindrances|Restlessness]]"^[Rob Burbea, "In Praise of Restlessness" (25 Nov. 2014), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/26009] I've talked about this, and "Questioning [[Awakening]],"^[Rob Burbea, "Questioning Awakening" (12 Nov. 2014), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/26010] and other talks.^[E.g. Rob Burbea, "What is Awakening?" [Parts 1-4] (5-8 Jan. 2018), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=what+is+awakening+mirrored+gates] So the [[desire]] is always there. The flame of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> never goes out, because there's always more. There's always a greater expansion. There's always more depth and diversity and range to what <span class="transcript"><a data-href="awakening" href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> is and can be. There are always new horizons of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="awakening" href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> opening up[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#High bar in Theravada; for Rob it's an endlessly expanding notion of awakening|.]] ^5-1
###### 5-2
So why? Why all these differences in people? Is it just differences of personality? [[Soul|Soul-differences]], if you like? Is it conditioning, whether that's in terms of personality, or education, or what people have been exposed to, the kinds of teachings, or the kind of culture, or the kind of family? Is it early childhood wounding, for example - that in how one expressed one's [[passion]] and one's [[love]] and one's [[desire]], the nakedness of that that the infant has, often that comes out quite uninhibited in infancy? Is it that there was a wounding there, in school, or with the family, or whatever it is, that caused one to block and inhibit one's <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, one's libido, one's <span class="transcript"><a data-href="passion" href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>? All of this, actually, we're going to talk about more. To me, these are interesting questions, the psychology involved in all of this: why some people are like that, why others different, why people go for this kind of path, or that kind of path, or that kind of notion of [[awakening]], or whatever it is. I want to include it over the course of this [[retreat]] very much. We'll return to that periodically[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Why people go for this kind of path or that kind of path or that kind of notion of awakening|.]] ^5-2
###### 5-3
In the past (I think a few years ago), I gave a couple of talks called "The [[Beauty]] of [[Desire]]," Part 1 and 2, I think.^[Rob Burbea, "The Beauty of Desire" [Parts 1 and 2] (19 and 26 Nov. 2011), [https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=the+beauty+of+desire](https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=the+beauty+of+desire)] And if I remember, in the second part of that, I introduced something that I discovered in practice, where there's a certain way of practising with [[desire]] - even if it's a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> not for [[awakening]], for something else - where it might at first be uncomfortable and bring _[[dukkha]]_, but there's a way of practising that doesn't dissolve it, that respects it, opens it up more. Practising in that way, actually respecting the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> and, if you like, empowering it - without necessarily acting on it; we're talking about a [[meditation]] here - practising this way leads to an [[experience]] where the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> does not bring _<span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>._ Quite the opposite: it brings a kind of fulfilment and opening of the being. So again, the whole way we tend to think about <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, and even if it's a good thing, it inherently brings some degree of [[Dukkha|suffering]] because there's tension - not so simple, not so simple. We'll be revisiting and actually elaborating more on that material as part of this [[retreat]], as part of what we're [[Passion|calling]] 'the [[Alchemy|alchemy of desire]].' ^5-3
###### 6-1
In the first three talks, hopefully it was clear that the whole idea of trying to live a life of [[Clinging|non-clinging]], trying to live without [[craving]] and [[clinging]], "just [[Letting go|let go of everything]]," etc., in that simplistically understood way, has several problems, which I'm not going to repeat now. So that, too, is part of the context. And also, again, what we're talking about on this [[retreat]] is very much in the context of the exploration, the elaboration, and the expansion of what I've been [[Passion|calling]] [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]] (related to [[Tantra|tantric]] practice, but different). I've talked a fair amount already about [[eros]] in the context of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>. One set of talks I remember - what's it called? - "An Ecology of [[Love]]," in I think three or four parts^[Rob Burbea, "An Ecology of Love" [Parts 1-4] (21 Dec. 2015), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/?search=an+ecology+of+love+sense+of+the+Earth] - talked about this dynamic which we're really, really going to elaborate on a lot in _this_ <span class="transcript"><a data-href="retreat" href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, because it's so central, such a powerful [[Conceptual framework]], and it opens up all kinds of things, allows and gives a basis to all kinds of avenues, what I'm calling the [[soulmaking dynamic]] or the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]]. I will explain more about that on this <span class="transcript"><a data-href="retreat" href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and bring everything back to that quite a bit, but it's already been explored. So again, that's part of the context through <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Parts of the context problems coming from wanting to live without clinging; imaginal practice|.]] ^6-1
###### 6-2
On this [[retreat]], in a way it's similar material to what I've explored before in [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]], but now I want to expand that piece about [[eros]], elaborate more regarding <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and its place and its potential - both in <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>, what we've been [[Passion|calling]] <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>, but also _in_ [[Dharma|the path]] and _for_ <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> as a whole, and what that might mean for <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>, and what kind of paths that opens up. So that's a little bit of the context. But there's more, even, because we could say, why bother? Why introduce this other word, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, when we have lots of words, as we elaborated in part one of the first talk? Why bother? Well, that's a good question. It's really a good question. Do we really need another concept here[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Eros in this retreat expands on imaginal practice but also explores the role of eros for the path as a whole|?]] ^6-2

Let me read you something. Someone I didn't know sent me an email sometime in 2015. It was a little while before I got ill. This arrived, forwarded from [[Gaia House]], out of the blue to me, by a man who lives in the Yukon in Canada. It's the Arctic Circle, I think. I'll read you all the email, just because there's so much [[insight]] here in what he's saying. He captures a lot of the themes that we're going to touch on, and highlights their necessity, and in a way, answers this question of "Why bother?" So I'll read it all. If you can, listen quite carefully, because it's very well-articulated, very beautifully written and, as I said, a lot of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> packed into what he's saying in all kinds of ways[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Email from former Canadian monk|.]] ^6-3
###### 6-4
"Dear Rob, my name is X" - you don't need to know his name - "and we've never met." By the way, I asked his permission to use this email in teaching, and he was really fine with that. I'll say this now, and I hope you can remember this, because I won't say it every time: when I use examples from other people, in the past if you have heard me do that, or in this [[retreat]], or in the future, generally speaking, almost without exception, I've asked the person involved if I could, and they have said yes. Almost without exception. Okay[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#used with permission|?]] ^6-4
###### 6-5
> My name is X, and we've never met. I have recently been reading your book and listening to some of your talks as recommended by my current teacher, Y. Interesting stuff. I found myself being challenged and derailed by some of your approaches to the [[Dharma]], often in a quite uncomfortable manner[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Challenged and derailed by some of Rob's approaches to the Dharma|.]] ^6-5
###### 7-1
This isn't really the bit that I want to read to you [laughs], but this is actually relevant, so I'm going to read it anyway. It's just short. ^7-1
###### 7-2
> This made me realize how easily I tend to align my whole perspective with certain specific sets of ideas and points of view without daring to shake it up. But you woke up the rebel in me, the iconoclast, and I'm grateful for this. ^7-2
###### 7-3
That's not so - well, it _is_ relevant, but not the main part. It's really this. He continues: ^7-3
###### 7-4
> I'm quite new to the [[Dharma|Buddhist path]], having only been formally practising for about three years now, but I dived straight into it. I've spent most of the last year as a monk, both in Myanmar and France, before disrobing with the idea of closing my worldly life and ordaining again this upcoming fall. I was quite committed to the idea, until I fell in [[love]] with a girl who came out of nowhere and dishevelled my whole world. Classic story, apparently[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#He fell in love with a girl|.]] ^7-4
###### 7-5
> Now, obviously, from the monk's perspective, this is the worst thing I could have done. But somehow I can't really buy into that. Not just because romance is so sweet and compelling, but mostly because of my intuition that there is something deeper running underneath lust and [[love]], something wider than her and me, something so beautifully alive that maybe it shouldn't be renounced so quickly. It's that same intuition that flared up every time I have fallen in <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>: the feeling that I'm playing a game that is beyond us; that the torrent in my chest is just running through me unaffected by matter or time, untamed by anybody; that I'm just here as a temporary vehicle for a [[desire]] that has never begun nor ceased stretching out towards the beloved, so my specific <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> [[stories]] become just some personified renditions of a myth essentially unspoken and inexhaustible[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Perceiving oneself as a temporary vehicle for an eternal love|.]] ^7-5
###### 7-6
There's so much [[insight]] and [[beauty]] in what he writes, and so relevant to the themes that we're going to be unravelling, unpacking, elaborating on. He continues: ^7-6
###### 7-7
> This is why I wanted to write you, because I have never heard anyone else attempting to reconcile [[romantic love]] with the [[Dharma]], and I would like to explore this possibility in order to avoid fragmenting my life into discrete arenas. I can't honestly bring myself to set up [[desire]] and [[freedom]] against each other as mutually exclusive principles, however much this seems to be insisted upon in the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, and this has been a huge difficulty in my recent attempts to engage fully with practice. I would like to start imagining an [[experience]] of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> or lust that would exceed the lack and the compulsion to fill it in, that would be unconditioned by [[pain]], without having to impose an artificial stance of dispassion and sacrifice a dynamic force of the human heart for a peace maybe too sterile ..[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#He cannot bring himself to see desire and freedom as mutually exclusive|.]] ^7-7
###### 7-8
> [He continues,] Unfortunately, I feel ill-equipped for such an undertaking, my heart just dramatically bouncing from an inclination towards disenchantment, tranquillity, to one of stormy [[passion]] and unreasonable attachments, constantly throwing myself off balance, completely invested into one configuration or the other. I don't really know where to start. As of now, I have recently let myself be overwhelmed by a crazy and beautiful romance [this is ... I find this really moving, all of it] to the point of neediness and jealousy. I want to open this up, to let it breathe, to bring some [[freedom]] within the tension of [[desire]] itself. So I'd like to ask you if you would have any advice, any lead into how I could directly practise with this explosive heart of mine ... Thank you kindly, and please accept my best regards[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#He wants to bring some freedom within the tension of desire|.]] ^7-8
###### 8-1
So, beautiful, beautiful email. I was struck by this, of course, and moved, busy as I was at the time, moved to write back and suggest we arrange a time to speak. We spoke, but just for about an hour. That was actually all we had the chance to do before I got ill quite out of the blue, as well, and had to cut down on most of my teaching. He said while we were talking that, before falling in [[love]] this time, he thought he had left all that behind him, and was now travelling a different path. I asked: "What's the [[image]] of that path?", and he mentioned [[Hermit|the hermit]] in solitude, in the peace of the woods or the mountains. I asked him, "Is it _peace_ you're after?" And he said, "[[Freedom]] from ruts and from the [[fear]] of engaging." There's a lot here. And we talked about [[imaginal]] sensibility, [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]]; what this meant about [[The Self|self-view]], the possible plurality within <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" href="The+Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span>; the possibility of regarding [[desire]] as not just [[Hindrances|restlessness]] (as we touched on in the first talks). What else was there? Yes, we really touched on the possibilities of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>, and also on working with the [[energy]] of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, as I was talking about in the "[[Beauty]] of [[Desire]]" talks[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#"Freedom from ruts and from the fear of engaging"|.]] ^8-1
###### 8-2
But we only could speak for an hour, and it's such a huge subject that all I could do was kind of give a few pointers, really, and suggest, I think, that we have some more contact at some point. There was another piece, actually, that this woman that he was involved with - this is part of the problem that initially instigated - this woman that he was involved with was wanting the relationship to be an open one (in other words, to be able to have sex with other people, etc.), that they both were okay with that. She wanted that, and he was very unsure about that, and very ambivalent about that. But I just pointed out to him that actually, although that's certainly an issue to explore and to ponder, whether it ended up being an open relationship or not, and even whether the relationship continued or ended, is actually _not_ the most deeply relevant thing[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#There was insecurity about the relationship being an open one|.]] ^8-2
###### 8-3
The more fundamental and universal questions he was asking in all this, they won't go away whether or not the relationship's open, or whether or not it continued. So when we say "why bother with all this?", well, that email articulates really, really well one of the reasons. It wasn't enough; the contact we had was not enough to really allow those kind of questions and the wrestling that he's talking about to really be opened up and supported. And hence this [[retreat]], and hence the teachings on this <span class="transcript"><a data-href="retreat" href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and the attempt here, because usually in [[Meditation|Insight Meditation]] - that's the tradition he's coming from - in terms of sexual [[Image|images]] and energies that arise, you know, as we talked about, either they're just regarded essentially as _kilesa_, defilement, or distraction in [[meditation]]. Or there's a sort of slightly more charitable and open, softer view that just says: notice them, allow them, certainly don't encourage them. So notice, allow, in this spirit of openness, but not the encouragement. Sexual and erotic-<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> and energies are _not_ regarded as having any real positive place on [[Dharma|the path]]; only so much in the context that _anything_ has a place on <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> because we're attempting, in a certain framing or vision of what <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> is, to be open to all things. Still, underneath that (this is the subtext), we can be open to all things, but it's _better_ if these things don't arise. It's easier, and basically just kind of let go of them. Maybe there's a kind of view of equality: "They're just like anything else to be opened to, to be let go of." But essentially it's like everything else: don't [[Clinging|cling]], don't get involved, don't create anything there[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#In the Insight Meditation tradition sexual energies better not arise|.]] ^8-3
###### 9-1
So [[Meditation|Insight Meditation]], one of its strengths is how much emphasis it puts on the feet. How many times have you heard _that_ [[Retreat|on retreat]]? <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Walking meditation</a></span>, the feet on the ground, standing [[meditation]], groundedness, "Can you feel your bum on the cushion?", etc. Really, really important. And how much emphasis also in <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> - again, one of its [[Beauty|beauties]], one of its strengths - on the heart: the openness of the heart, the capacities of the heart, the [[cultivation]] and the centrality of the heart. And more and more in <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> circles there's an emphasis on what we could call the head, in the sense of - slowly, a few strands within the broader <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> tradition - really emphasizing study of the texts, etc. So feet, heart, and head. Other bits might be missing. [laughs] Can it involve our hips? Feet, heart, head, hips[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Feet heart head hips|?]] ^9-1
###### 9-2
So again, there's a kind of lacuna there, certainly around [[sexuality]] and that kind of erotics. But I really want to say, when _we_ use the word [[eros]], it _includes_ <span class="transcript"><a data-href="sexuality" href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span> in what we're meaning by <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. So we include <span class="transcript"><a data-href="sexuality" href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span>. We include sexual attraction, sexual [[energy]], etc. But it's actually much, much more than that. We're talking about something much more fundamental, and also that can be both very intense and very subtle. Well, sexual <span class="transcript"><a data-href="energy" href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> and sexual attraction can also be very subtle, but even more subtle than that. We're talking about something, as a notion, that's actually more basic and often more subtle[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Our definition of "eros" includes sexuality but it's more fundamental and often more subtle|.]] ^9-2
###### 9-3
But again, you know, not to over-labour the point, but why introduce this concept of [[eros]]? Why distinguish something called '<span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>' from [[craving]] or greed or [[desire]] in general? Well, it's there already. [[Eros]], as _we're_ meaning that term, what _we_ mean by <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, is already functioning every day in our lives. {It's already part of our [[experience]], as we'll explain. Making the distinction draws out something that otherwise might not be so clear to us.} And, as I said, that might shut doors if it's not so clear, if we don't draw it out. Making a distinction, or any kind of distinction, amplifies something. By distinguishing this from that, A from B, A and B get amplified, or one of A and B gets amplified, gets magnified. It's like you get to put it under a magnifying glass. It gets clearer. Setting it apart allows us to investigate it, to take it as a theme of investigation. If I don't [[Delineations|delineate]] it in the first place, I can't take it as a theme of investigation[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#1 Because eros is already active in our life and by delineating it we get a handle on it|.]] ^9-3
###### 9-4
The delineation is the beginning of opening something up, like a - what would an [[image]] be? I'm not sure if this would work as an <span class="transcript"><a data-href="image" href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, but like a tear, or like getting your foot in the door, you can begin then to pry open the door, or tearing a fabric, a veil, to reveal something. Setting it apart allows us to investigate it, to become interested in it, and then we can see how it works. What is this thing? How does it work? And where does it lead, this thing that we're going to call [[eros]]? Because, and this is one of our central contentions, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> will lead to different experiences, to different ends, than [[craving]] leads to. It leads to ends and experiences other than the ones <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> leads to. It opens up, if you like, regions of [[soul]], to use a certain language. [[Eros]] is very connected with [[Soul|soulfulness]], with what we're going to call '[[soulmaking]].' I'll explain more what we mean by that, but for now, let's just say the widening and deepening of a sense of [[Divinity|sacredness]], the widening and deepening and diversification of our sense of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span>. But also this word, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="soulmaking" href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, has much to do with [[meaningfulness]], and resonance, and depth, and [[dimensionality]], [[beauty]], and all kinds of things. <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Eros" href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> is connected with a <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sense of divinity</a></span>, and with what we've been [[Passion|calling]] in past [[Retreat|retreats]] [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]]: the very sense we have, the vision, the [[perception]], of the world, the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmos</a></span> we live in, the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmos</a></span> about us, our very sense of existence. We're going to go into these terms, [[divinity]], <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a></span>, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="soulmaking" href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, etc., later in much more detail, because they're very woven into this whole theme of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Eros is connected to divinity cosmopoesis soulmaking to be covered later|.]] ^9-4
###### 10-1
So that's one reason. It's in our life already, [[eros]]. We already [[experience]] it. We just need to draw it out and investigate it and see where it leads, because it _does_ lead to somewhere other than where what we might call '[[craving]]' leads to. A second reason why, why make this delineation, is to hopefully establish, or at least highlight the potential of, opening to a recognition of the [[Divinity|sacredness]] of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> itself. Again, this is something we're going to come back to a lot: the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span> of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> itself. We can see that, and it's very different to see <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> as sacred rather than as a defilement. And that includes also the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span>, or at least the potential <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span>, of [[sexuality]]. <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" href="Divinity" class="internal-link">Sacredness</a></span> never resides in this or that object or thing; we sacralize. We make something or other sacred through our relationship with it. So there's the possibility of sacralizing <span class="transcript"><a data-href="sexuality" href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span>, rather than just viewing <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> or <span class="transcript"><a data-href="sexuality" href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span> as a defilement, or as leading inevitably to defilement[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#2 Opening to the recognition of the sacredness of eros itself|.]] ^10-1
###### 10-2
All this, as I said, is not really so adequately addressed in the [[Dharma]] at present, for the most part. We talk about [[sexuality]] and [[desire]]. We talk a lot about <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, but in a negative way mostly. We talk about <span class="transcript"><a data-href="sexuality" href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span>, but very little, except in terms of ethical prohibitions - for example, the [[precepts]] - or it's admitted, within sort of typically assumed limits, that it's an aspect of life (predominately lay life, but still there for monastics). But there isn't really this exploration, inquiry. It's not really opened up, as I said, as part of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>. As we mentioned already at least once, you know, most people have a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> for [[romantic love]], or most people are involved in [[relationships]], or in marriages, perhaps, and a finer discrimination is needed there. This is not _[[Metta|mettā]]_ . I cannot reduce a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="romantic love" href="romantic+love" class="internal-link">romantic love</a></span> relationship or a marriage to _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ . There's something more involved, or that needs to be involved. Part of that 'more' is what we're going to call [[eros]], what we're [[Passion|calling]] <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. If I'm interested in that, if I'm really interested in bringing a fullness of investigation, and if I'm really interested in <span class="transcript"><a data-href="romantic love" href="romantic+love" class="internal-link">romantic love</a></span> and romantic partnerships being really integrally part of the practice, then this brings all kinds of inquiries. For example, in a long-term relationship, what keeps the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> alive? What stifles it? What kills it? What erodes it? What just allows it to fritter away? And what keeps the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> alive in a long-term relationship[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#All this is not really adequately addressed in the Dharma at present|?]] ^10-2
###### 10-3
So there's that second reason, the re-sacralizing of [[sexuality]], [[love]], but also of [[eros]], and making it more part of [[Dharma|the path]], integrally, fully, richly. Really, with all this, a third reason why, what are we doing, why make this discrimination of something called <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, is related to what I said before: I'm interested in creating or opening an area or a direction of investigation. I certainly don't want to just sort of, for instance, _assert_ something like the [[Divinity|sacredness]] of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>: "I am telling you <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is sacred," and then, you know, so what? Some people will agree, some people will disagree. It's pointless. What I'm much more interested in is a domain and a dimension for a much freer, more open and penetrating inquiry, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> inquiry. And always in <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> inquiry, always, there's something really fundamental to see: there's a principle that how we view something - always we see that how we view something affects the [[perception]] of that 'something.' The ideas that I have, the preconceptions, the conceptions, the relationship with the 'something' that I'm investigating, the area of inquiry, affects my <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of that 'something,' and affects the related experiences that unfold, that can unfold, or that will unfold. All that's to do with [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]]. The view, the [[Ways of looking|way of looking]], affects. It shapes the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, [[fabrication]]. We've talked about that. It's part of what we talked about before[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#3 Opening a direction of investigation|.]] ^10-3
###### 11-1
We really have to see this [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]]. How I view something affects my [[perception]] of that thing, so that must be part of the way that I'm inquiring. And a part of that, a part of the investigation, is perhaps this question: what happens, how does it affect this whole thing called [[eros]], if I view it as sacred? Even if I just _try_ and view it, even just a little, just entertain the idea that it might be sacred? So that's a sort of subset of a subset of the investigation: what happens _if_ ? I'm not asserting anything here. This is all really in the spirit of investigation[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#How does it affect the thing called eros if I view it as sacred|.]] ^11-1
###### 11-2
And I'll say it one more time [laughs]: _we_ mean by '[[eros]]' something including, but much more than, [[sexuality]], much more than sexual attraction or [[energy]], or sexual interactions between people. You can have, there exists, there arises for us, an erotic connection or erotic connections (plural) with the earth; with a tree, or a piece of land; with the stars; with the [[Cosmology|cosmos]]; erotic connection with the divine; erotic connection/relationship with the senses; an erotic sensibility, an erotic connection with [[Materialism|materiality]]; certainly with another [[Personhood|human being]], but not only humans - with other living beings. Certainly also not just with others, but we can have - and hopefully we _do_ have, and we're going to elaborate on this - an erotic connection with oneself, or erotic connections (plural) with oneself and aspects of oneself, faces of oneself, or the selves' faces, or self faces, whatever. There can be and hopefully is an erotic view, an erotic connection, with [[Dharma|the path]], and with the idea, or the vision, the [[fantasy]], the notion, the concept of [[awakening]]. Certainly always there's an erotic connection with [[Imaginal|imaginal figures]], even when it seems like there isn't. And there's even the possibility of erotic connection with ideas and concepts[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#You can have an erotic connection with everything and anything|.]] ^11-2
###### 11-3
So [[eros]] pervades very broadly. We mean much more than '[[sexuality]]' here. [[Eros]] can also be or can seem to be, at different times, primarily energetic, or primarily physical, [[Embodiment|embodied]], if you like, or primarily [[imaginal]], or primarily intellectual. It can, at different times, be or seem to be primarily all those things. Actually, I would say it always involves all of these aspects. <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Eros" href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> always involves [[energy]], what we're going to call the '[[Energy body]],' and the energetics; it involves some kind of [[embodiment]], or relationship with <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and views of the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of the body</a></span>; it always involves the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="imaginal" href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>; and it always involves ideation, intellect, concept, what we're going to call '[[logos]].' It always involves all that. So it's already something multidimensional, and we're going to go into this more. As I said, whenever there is a sense of [[Soul|soulfulness]], that kind of richness, resonance, depth, [[dimensionality]], [[beauty]], [[meaningfulness]], in our existence, in the being, whenever there is [[soulmaking]], [[Divinity|sacredness]] in our existence, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is involved. <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Eros" href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> is involved whenever there is <span class="transcript"><a data-href="soulmaking" href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Eros involves energy embodiment the imaginal and logos|.]] ^11-3
###### 11-4
Now, I think it's fair to say, I think it's obvious and maybe important to say as well, that different people at different times will find these investigations that we're going into around [[eros]] and [[soulmaking]] more or less interesting. So this, to me, is interesting in itself. It seems to me, it does seem to me, that people differ in the flavours or the characters, if you like, of the ways <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, or libido, or if we say [[Eros|life force]], expresses in their lives. They differ in the flavours, the characters, the ways <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> expresses in their lives. The fire, if you like, if <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is a kind of fire, the fire of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> looks and burns differently. People's [[soul]]-fire burns and looks differently, one to another. There's quite a range there, you know - the flaming [[passion]]. And also at different times, a flaming <span class="transcript"><a data-href="passion" href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>, a very steady, quiet, small, but unquenchable flame; or the raging fire, whatever, leaping from one thing to another, the flames. It looks and burns differently[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Different people different characters also how eros expresses in their lives|.]] ^11-4
###### 12-1
But people also differ, it seems to me at least, in the amount, strength, and depth, if you like, of [[eros]], of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> or the libido that flows through them in their life or into them. Differ in the amount, strength, or depth. So this also is complex. Some people are like this, and some people are like that. There's a range. But it's also a fact (we touched on this before) that, for all kinds of reasons which also are interesting, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and libido or [[Eros|life force]] _can_ be and often _is_ blocked in our lives in different ways, inhibited at times or in certain situations, or certain expressions or along certain lines are blocked, whereas others are free. Or there can be a more chronic and more pervasive blocking or inhibition of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and the libido. It's not so much that person really, so to speak, _is_ just a certain character or style; something is blocking or inhibited, or crushed or whatever, there[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#People also different in the strength and depth of eros itself|.]] ^12-1
###### 12-2
Still, despite all that, and despite the varying differences of interest between different people at different times and all that, I'd say that [[eros]] is a necessary, an integral aspect or element of what we're going to be [[Passion|calling]] '[[soulmaking]],' what we have in the past called '<span class="transcript"><a data-href="soulmaking" href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>.' And therefore, an inquiry into <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is important for anyone interested, at all interested or devoted to <span class="transcript"><a data-href="soulmaking" href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. It's just part of what one needs to consider, and explore, and open up, and go into, and allow, and understand, and support, and [[Cultivation|nourish]], question[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Eros is a necessary part of soulmaking|.]] ^12-2
###### 12-3
On this [[retreat]], on this course, the intention of the teachings is really, if you like, to open a door, or open doors. I mentioned that it's possible that certain doors are actually shut or even locked shut in the way that we're conceiving - not just of [[Dharma]], but of life, of existence, and of who we are, and what the world is, and what existence is. So the aim, broadly speaking, of these teachings, this set of teachings, is to open doors, and to sketch - at least sketch, begin to sketch - a path for those who would move through these doors and move into new territory, for those who would like to travel certain paths, and to offer a map - at least the beginnings of a map, loosely speaking - a frame of reference, and light certain beacons for navigation for those also who already find themselves in uncharted territory around [[eros]], around [[desire]]. They're already there, and they need some kind of orientation, some kind of way of thinking and ways of practising, practical tools, subtleties of practical differentiations and navigation and steering, as all practices need[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#On this retreat the intention is to open doors and offer a map|.]] ^12-3
###### 12-4
Some, as we mentioned, already see that maybe the more usual or narrow sort of ways we can interpret the [[Dharma]], or [[Insight|understandings]] of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, or frameworks, may not be enough, or _are_ not enough, to open up this territory. Some people already sense - as in the beautiful email I read earlier - already sense a holiness in [[desire]], the holiness of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> in life or in certain areas or directions of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. And also in [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]], this is very common. They sense that holiness, but it's tricky. It's tricky, and not easy, and it's complex, and it's rich, and help is needed, and a [[Conceptual framework]] is needed, and tools are needed, and [[Delineations|distinctions]], and practice instructions are needed, etc. - both on the cushion, and in life, and in relationship[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#The sense of the holiness of desire is tricky so help is needed|.]] ^12-4
###### 12-5
Again, back to context: these teachings sit within a larger context of wanting to open a path that integrates a lot of elements that we've already talked about over the last few years - [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]], [[soulmaking]], [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]], this re-enchantment of the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmos</a></span>, the [[poetry]] of [[perception]], the experiences and the senses of [[Divinity|sacredness]], of [[divinity]], [[eros]]. All this we touched before, and in fact, I'm going to - probably in the next talk - attempt a kind of brief glossary of all these terms. Hopefully that's helpful too. This [[retreat]], as I said, is a slightly different angle. It's coming from the angle of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, emphasizing more the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, and expanding on more what that means. But all this, hopefully you can see how it is integrated with, it sits fitted into, tessellated with, our usual - maybe the more typical - [[Dharma|Dharma teachings]] about [[craving]], and [[letting go]] of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, and how <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> leads to _[[dukkha]]_ [[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#These teachings fit into the ones about imaginal practice and soulmaking but also those more typical Dharma teachings about craving and dukkha|.]] ^12-5
###### 13-1
It sits with that, alongside, mixed with that, in complement to that, and also the much more radical teachings about investigating [[clinging]] and the whole spectrum of what that notion, that word, means, '<span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>,' and all the subtleties and the [[Beauty|beauties]] of working with that in practice: [[letting go]] of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, moving up and down the spectrum of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, and seeing what it does to the [[fabrication]] of the [[perception]] of [[The Self|self, other, world, time]], etc., really going deeply in practice and in the [[Insight|understanding]], in the realization, the [[insight]], into the teachings of [[dependent origination]] at a very deep level - not the more common level; the very deep level - and unfolding, if you like, the [[experience]] of the [[Unfabricated]] and the [[Emptiness|emptiness of all things]], so that existence is opened, and radical [[freedom]], radical opening of the sense of existence. And also (I've talked about this before) that <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of [[emptiness]] ... well, let's say this: it can provide a non-realist basis for all these other explanations and explorations that we're going into[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#It also fits with emptiness teachings|.]] ^13-1
###### 13-2
So that to the degree, to the depth that we kind of have taken to heart, understood the teachings of [[emptiness]], how much they've penetrated the heart and the [[Insight|understanding]], to that degree we can really practise a flexibility of [[Ways of looking]], and also of [[Conceptual framework|conceptual frameworks]]. We can entertain different ideas and <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" href="Conceptual+framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a></span> without having to believe in the reality of any of it, that any of these <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span> are revealing a reality of, "This is how the world is. This is how I am. This is what the [[nature]] of things is," or "This idea, this <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" href="Conceptual+framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>, is the truth of things." So there's a real facility and flexibility of just moving between <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>, all kinds of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>, a really broad range, and all kinds of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" href="Conceptual+framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a></span>. It's woven into, integrated - these teachings are integrated into the usual [[Dharma|Dharma teachings]] about [[craving]] and [[letting go]] and releasing _[[dukkha]]_, and the much deeper teachings about [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]] and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="emptiness" href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, and that forms a non-realist basis. All that is partly what allows us to open up teachings of [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]] and, if you like, [[Tantra|tantric]] teachings - although I make a distinction there, but [[tantra]] _is_ based on that <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="emptiness" href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, absolutely. It's _supposed_ to be, at least, as I've mentioned before[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#The different ways of looking form a non-realist basis for explanations and explorations|.]] ^13-2
###### 13-3
So all this is integrated together, and as I mentioned, there are other possibilities through [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]], and through the [[Insight|understanding]] of [[eros]], of having what I would call a fuller, more adequate concept and [[Perception|perceptions]] of [[The Self|self, other, world]], etc., existence - ways of relating and seeing and experiencing all that that are more [[Soul|soulful]], more [[soulmaking]], conducive to <span class="transcript"><a data-href="soulmaking" href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, that widen and diversify our sense of [[Divinity|sacredness]], open our senses of [[beauty]] and <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span>, [[divinity]][[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#This results in a more adquate concept and perceptions of self other world|.]] ^13-3
###### 13-4
So I hope you can see in all of this, and if not right now, at least at some point, you can see that this isn't really an [[eclecticism]]. I'm not sort of interested in just drawing different things together, tossing them in a pot for the sake of being interesting, or just being restless in a more superficial way. I hope you can see at some point how integrated, as I said, all these teachings are and, if you like, how necessary, how inevitable many of these teachings are, because, as I said, one way of [[Insight|understanding]] the [[Dharma]] unfolds a certain depth and a certain possibility, and that just keeps unfolding in a kind of very necessary way. So they're necessary to what's gone before, but also necessary to our existence and to our practice and for the future[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#It's not eclecticism but integrated into an inevitable way the Dharma unfolds|.]] ^13-4
###### 14-1
Maybe more typical [[Dharma]] psychologies - let's say just the teaching of the links of [[dependent origination]]; we talked a bit about that. One of the immense strengths of the [[Buddha]]'s teaching and <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma teaching</a></span> is that he kind of gives us a set of concepts, and in a way, they become [[Ways of looking]]. That's what these concepts are; they become <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>. But they serve to simplify. So <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> concepts serve to simplify, simplify because they [[Fabrication|fabricate]] less. When I use a certain set of concepts, for instance, there's less _[[Papanca|papañca]]_ . There's less of this crazy complexifying and nonsense-making, if you like, entanglement. But at a deeper level, too, they simplify in the sense that the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> concepts become <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span> that move towards less and less [[fabrication]], and less and less <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> is a state of simplicity. He's saying, "Don't think about _this_ . Don't think about _that_ . Think in this way, and look in this way. Adopt these <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>," and there's a disentangling, a certain amount of simplifying - both of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span> (by constraining the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span> to certain concepts), but also then in what is seen, of course. There's a simplifying in the [[perception]] of things. And that simplifying just goes deeper and deeper. So not just the simplicity of the 'is-ness,' the so-called '[[Emptiness#Suchness|suchness]]' of things and the vividness of that, but the simplicity of our life, and then the simplicity of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> _beyond_ the thing-ness of things, as we go deeper and deeper into unfabricating, and eventually into something that is, in effect, so simple that even 'is' or 'is not' doesn't apply to it: the [[Unfabricated]][[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Dharma concepts aim towards less papanca|.]] ^14-1
###### 14-2
So again, if I use a certain language, the [[soul]], the [[psyche]], wants and needs, obviously, a kind of disentangling. It certainly wants that journey into perceiving less [[fabrication]]. But there are, so to speak, other [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] or strata of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="soul" href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> (we could use that language), of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="psyche" href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>, that want something else. And so other [[Delineations|distinctions]] and [[delineations]] become necessary, rather than just simplicity, simplicity, simplicity, unfabricating, unfabricating, unfabricating, unfabricating, [[Unfabricated]]. Rather than just the simplifying of that direction, which is so much the power of [[Meditation|Dharma practice]] and [[Dharma]] concepts, other <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a></span>, other <span class="transcript"><a data-href="delineations" href="delineations" class="internal-link">delineations</a></span>, become necessary. What is the difference between _[[Papanca|papañca]]_ and [[fantasy]] or [[image]] in the way _we're_ using it? Difference between daydreaming and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fantasy" href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span> and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="image" href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>? What's the difference between [[soulmaking]] and the kind of simplicity of [[freedom]] that I've just talked about? What's the difference between [[eros]] and [[craving]], or [[desire]] and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>? What's the difference between <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and [[love]], or the _[[Brahmaviharas|brahmavihāras]]_ [[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#The soul wants disentangling but also something else|?]] ^14-2
###### 14-3
I'm going to make this contention (it's something I'm really going to come back to a lot on this [[retreat]]): something in us, something in the [[soul]], wants to know, wants to [[experience]], not just [[oneness]], not just transcendence or the [[Unfabricated]], nor just (quote) 'life as it is,' as if there really even _is_ a 'life as it is,' as if such a thing exists, such a thing is possible to behold. We don't _just_ want <span class="transcript"><a data-href="oneness" href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>, transcendence, or that freshness of [[Attention|bare attention]], certainly. We want more, even, than all that - certainly more than the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Attention" data-href="Attention" href="Attention" class="internal-link">bare attention</a></span>, I hope, but also more than a dissolution in <span class="transcript"><a data-href="oneness" href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>, and also more than transcendence or the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Unfabricated" href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a></span>, even that[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#We don't just want oneness etc but more than that|.]] ^14-3
###### 14-4
So we need a kind of more elaborate, you could say, or a slightly more sophisticated psychology. We need a [[Dharma]] psychology that both recognizes that which is already present, but which needs to be, as I said, drawn out, amplified a little more, recognized - the fact, for example, that [[eros]] is more than _[[Metta|mettā]]_ ; it's not the same as [[craving]]; it's not even just [[Kusala|wholesome]] [[desire]], _[[Hindrances|hitacchanda]],_ or <span class="transcript"><a data-href="desire" href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> that leads to less [[Dukkha|suffering]]. We need to recognize something that's already present in our life, that hasn't been drawn [[attention]] to yet, highlighted, drawn out, investigated. And we need a slightly more elaborate <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> psychology because of the different kinds of [[Divinity|sacredness]] and the different realms of [[experience]] which are slightly more involved. A psychology that involves concepts like <span class="transcript"><a data-href="eros" href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> can open up for us, without which either these realms don't open up, these directions don't open up, or they just get dismissed[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#We need a more sophisticated Dharma psychology|.]] ^14-4
