Summary: [[Eros Unfettered Part 3]]

<br/>

###### 1-1
Okay, so let us look a little more at various aspects of what is involved in the movement of [[soulmaking]], what is necessary. Let us look at what is necessary, some of what is necessary for the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]] to unfold and have its range and its process, and correspondingly, how that movement and that expansion and deepening and widening can be stifled or blocked or diverted, how the movement of [[eros]] can be diverted. And again, why so much? Why are we circling around this, weaving in and out of this so much, this whole business about the soulmaking dynamic and the idea of eros-psyche-logos being stimulated by eros? We are circling because the ideas are unfamiliar, I think, because they are new ideas. They are not in circulation in the culture, I do not think - certainly not in [[Dharma|Dharma culture]]; I do not think in the wider culture either. And ideas that are new, that are unfamiliar, that are not in circulation need repeating for us. We need to chew on them, to digest them, to incorporate them, to assimilate them, to be able to use them, to actually have them be powerful. ^1-1
###### 1-2
So they need that circling. They need the circulation of our reflection in our lives. So not just abstract, intellectual reflection. There is a level of that. But actually reflection in our lives, so we use them, implement them, bring them to bear on our [[experience]] in life, in relationship, on the [[meditation]] cushion, in relationship with everything, with nature, with whatever we [[love]], et cetera. And I believe and I hope, at least, that trying to forge a [[conceptual framework]] that is supportive is actually really in the service of opening up what [[Dharma|the path]] can be, opening up new territories, beautiful territories, important territories. All that is served by having a powerful conceptual framework. That is part of the process. ^1-2
###### 1-3
So when we gave the sort of small, loose definition, beginning, provisional definition of [[eros]], we said it was a [[desire]] to connect, to touch, to contact more. We can very easily assume that there is a limit implicit in touching - once you have touched, you have touched. You can touch for longer, but once you have touched, you have touched. Once you have touched a [[Embodiment|whole body]] or a whole object, you have touched it. Once you have connected, you have connected. Once you contact, you have contacted. So we can easily assume that there is a limit implicit in that. But actually what we are saying now is that it is open-ended. So the words touch, connect, contact, certainly words like penetrate, it is open-ended - there is no limit to that penetration, necessarily at all. Or open, or receive the beloved other, open to and receive the beloved other - there is no limit to the opening and to the receiving. Or know them, I want to know them more, know this more, this beloved object, this beloved other. There is no limit to these, the penetration, the depth of penetration, the scope of and depth of opening and receiving and knowing. ^1-3
###### 1-4
So using those words, but not implying a limit, because we are saying that in the process of [[eros]] stimulating and igniting the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]], their mutual expansion, mutual fertilization, et cetera, the [[The Self|sense of self]], the [[imaginal]] self and the imaginal other, grow. They expand, they get deeper, they get richer, more complicated, potentially at least. So because both the subject who opens and receives and the object or the other, the beloved other, the erotic object that is penetrated or opened to, both the subject and object, the self and the other, grow potentially, there is potentially no limit to how much penetration or this process of penetration, of opening, receiving, knowing, touching, connecting, contacting, et cetera. ^1-4
###### 1-5
And if we approach it from the other angle, we could say - so [[eros]], from what we have said so far, eros stimulates [[psyche]] and [[logos]], the [[imaginal]] and the idea or the concepts involved in the sense of the other, of the beloved other, and also self and all that. Looking at it from the other angle, and just as important and valid, we could say that psyche and logos, [[image]] and idea, need to allow eros' further penetration and opening. They need to allow that more aspect of eros. So whatever image we have of this erotic object or the other, whatever idea, that image and idea need to allow more penetration, more opening. They need to allow that movement of eros. Wherever it is at, that process, it needs to have something that allows more. If it does not need it right now, sooner or later it will need it. So what this implies, again, to state it again, is that the [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] at images and the way of looking at [[Perception|perceptions]] is significant. Because either it supports psyche and logos to allow that further penetration, further opening that eros wants, or it does not. ^1-5
###### 2-1
Now actually, to state again, the way we are using the word [[image]] already includes a [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] at it that sees it as [[imaginal]], so that is supportive to a certain extent, or to a certain level. But still, that might need to grow. But if we step back a little and just look at this whole notion of ways of looking in relation to [[soulmaking]], we can see that certain ways of looking not just limit soulmaking but actually dampen it; they put out the fire of soulmaking, they cause that stream to dry up (in a more watery image), they dissipate the imaginal or dismiss it or reduce it, they put out the fire of [[eros]]. Certain ways of looking will do that. And among those ways of looking that kind of, if you like, kill soulmaking, some of them reduce [[clinging]] and some of them actually increase clinging. Okay? ^2-1
###### 2-2
But we can differentiate, if you like, three sort of broad directions or kinds of [[ways of looking]], if you like, or views. There is what we might call a group of views that are realist or flatly humanistic, that their view of something that arises might be, for example, that this is a result of or this is representing something that happened in my childhood, or it is representing a faculty of my [[mind]], a component, and reducing it in those ways. Or even more, this is just a result of random neuronal firings, et cetera. So there is a way that the [[Personhood|human being]] is reduced to a sort of flat, kind of modernist humanist version of what a human being is there. And that will not support [[soulmaking]]. That kind of view, the realist, flatly humanist view, will not support soulmaking. ^2-2
###### 2-3
Second group of [[ways of looking]] is ways of looking that actually [[Fabrication|fabricate]] less, that lead to less fabrication than the usual state of [[consciousness]]. So this could be just a little less fabrication. What we usually call [[mindfulness]] in the traditional sense of the word is, relatively speaking, a degree, a modicum of less fabrication than usual, or [[Attention|bare attention]] or whatever. Then there are other ways of looking which actually fabricate much less, much less than the usual state of consciousness, much less than bare attention or mindfulness, and we have touched on those before. They can take you into [[jhanas]] or deep states of [[oneness]], and eventually even transcending of all [[perception]] and all conventional [[experience]] in the knowing, in the opening to the [[Unfabricated]], to nonfabrication. There is a group of ways of looking that actually decrease fabrication, the second group. ^2-3
###### 2-4
And a third group we could call [[ways of looking]] that are [[soulmaking]], the soulmaking perspectives, where there is not this reduction going on. We are not reducing the [[image]] or the [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]] of something. And neither are we dissolving it by [[Fabrication|fabricating]] [[perception]] less. So we are not blurring out into a kind of [[oneness]] of white light or deep unfabrication or something like that. Nor are we just reducing this thing in some kind of psychological explanation or biological explanation or whatever it is. So three groups of ways of looking. Actually - and we will return to this because it is not that simple - the relation to this process of unfabrication, our relationship to it and our [[conceptual framework]] of what is happening as we engage ways of looking that fabricate less, the relation to that whole process of fabricating less and the conceptual framework of it can actually become soulmaking, through the relationship with that and through the idea we have of it. We will return to that. But just to say, it is not so simple, the divisions between these three ways of looking. But broadly speaking, we can [[Delineations|delineate]] three. ^2-4
###### 2-5
When there is, when there has come about, in one way or another, in the [[perception]] of an other a sense of there is more there, there is more depth here, there is a sense of [[unfathomability]] to this object, to this [[image]], to this person that I am seeing soulfully, there is a sense of more to move into, of mystery, a mystery of the other, depth of mystery of the other, in the perception of the other, into which the [[eros]] might expand, might penetrate, might open, or to which it might open to, then that sense of more, that sense of other [[Dimensionality|dimensions]], even if we do not see them clearly, that sense actually stimulates eros. So it is working the other way around - the [[psyche]], the [[logos]], the sense, the perception stimulates the eros and inflames the eros. And what happens there - and again, if you really enter into [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]], whether it is with, so to speak, purely intrapsychic images or again with someone or something of nature or some person in your life that actually is alive to you as image in this [[soulmaking]], [[Soul|soulful]], beautiful way, ways - then we get the sense that that other, that object, if you like, contains a multiplicity of images. Some of them will be clearly perceived, maybe right now, or maybe we know them from before, with our [[history]] with working with this object, this person, this image. And some are kind of intuited. You can feel them there, you can sense the presence of other images within this figure, within this person, within your perception of them, but they are not yet known. They remain sort of presences intuited, vaguely intuited, but not known. ^2-5
###### 3-1
And with that, there is a sense of this inexhaustible mystery that can arise, the depth of [[soul]] in this person that I am beholding, the depth of soul I am beholding in this person or in this thing or in nature - it is like, nature ensouled; nature has this inexhaustible [[unfathomability]], the levels of mystery to it. And always then, sometimes the intuition, the intimation, is that always the unknown is greater than the known. There is always more to discover, because we have learned about this [[infinity]], the potential limitlessness of this process, so one can actually palpably feel or palpably perceive a sense of the [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] and the faces that are not yet known to me, not yet clearly perceived to me, will always, so to speak, outnumber the ones that are known, that have been beautiful and [[soulmaking]] to me so far. ^3-1
###### 3-2
That sense of inexhaustible mystery stimulates the [[eros]], is itself [[soulmaking]]. So we can say that eros requires an [[image]], but it also maybe requires, if you like, a region of what is as yet unknown. So this sense of territory it can move into, of a landscape of [[soul]], a world of soul into which eros or our souls can move, so to speak, as we penetrate the other, or to which we can open. It needs the image but also the sense of the mystery, the as yet unknown, in the image, with the image. We could even say that the eros generates this very [[perception]], stimulates the image and stimulates the sense of some more, some territory beyond, this pothos generating a beyond, if you like, that it can then enter, the soul territory, penetrate, open to. ^3-2
###### 3-3
Now, this [[infinity]], this inexhaustible mystery, it might be of a kind of universal nature, as we have touched on before. A very common one is a universal [[love]], and the infinity of that, or the universality of [[awareness]], or even the [[Unfabricated]] - sometimes you can actually get the sense of that shining through, or everything, if you like, [[Embodiment|embodying]] that in a mysterious way. But the inexhaustibility that we are talking about here predominantly - or rather, in addition to those kinds of inexhaustibility that are universal, so this universal awareness shining through is the same in everything, or the universal love, it is pervasive, the same in everything. So this person that I am beholding is not any different in the way that they express that, they are that; that is the essence of everything. We are talking about in addition to that kind of [[perception]] of mystery, of [[unfathomability]], and that kind of infinity, there is a different kind of infinity that comes about through this, what we have been [[Passion|calling]] the vertical spectrum of the [[imaginal]], the sense of these [[Dimensionality|dimensions]], if you like, inhering or contained in the beloved other. There is an infinite fecundity, an infinite, if you like, number of theophanies in the particulars of that [[soul]] that we are perceiving, of that object that we are perceiving. The infinite fecundity of soul, of [[Divinity|theophany]], through the particulars. ^3-3
###### 3-4
Another way of saying all this, because it is all connected, is like [[eros]] generates this very sense, and then falls in [[love]] with it, moves into it and fills it. So eros has, we have been saying, this tendency, this inclination, this impetus within it that fertilizes, if you like, that stimulates the fecundity of the [[soul]] and of the [[mind]]. Eros is a cosmogonos, we said. It gives rise to more, more [[perception]] of the other, [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] of perception, richnesses, complications, depths and breadths. So in the expansion of the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos]], there is this birthing of cosmoses, if you like. Eros, in this process, this soulmaking dynamic, creates or [[Fabrication|fabricates]] or discovers, if you like, both, more [[psyche]], more [[image]]. There is an increase in the range of images within this object and more generally, and the perceived facets and dimensions of things, especially the beloved. More mystery and a sense of depth and dimensionality, et cetera. ^3-4
###### 4-1
So let us talk a little bit about the [[logos]] aspect and the necessity of that stretching and growing, or how it can get limited, or in other words, when it supports the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]] and when it actually inhibits it through it itself being limited or [[Constriction|constrained]] or too rigid. So remember, when we are talking about logos or concept, we are not always talking about something conscious or something even involving actual thought in the [[mind]]. It is often operating at a level that is what we might call unconscious. We are not aware of the view, the conception, conceptions that are operating. They are subliminal. Usually they are based on assumptions that unwittingly we have absorbed, usually from the culture or some culture, subculture that we are moving in. So logos has a broad range. It can involve thinking, an elaborate [[conceptual framework]] thought out, but a lot of the time it does not involve that at all. We are really talking about something very subtle woven into [[perception]] of which we are rarely conscious and rarely have we actually figured out for ourselves and arrived at by ourselves; more we have just been indoctrinated or absorbed it. ^4-1
###### 4-2
But when the [[logos]], the concept, the idea of something is too narrow or fixed, and that can be in many kinds of ways, as we will explore, but for example one idea is just believing rigidly in a materialist view of things, a physicalist view of things, that things are essentially just matter. Personality, [[consciousness]] arises out of that, out of the genetic makeup and the neuronal makeup and the conditioning from the culture affecting the flow of neurons, et cetera. And matter is just matter - these things, trees, et cetera, or inanimate things, are just matter. So a fundamentally materialist view. Such a view, if it is too tight and too rigidly adhered to, too fixed, it will actually kind of prevent the [[imaginal]] level from kind of blossoming. It will prevent this fertility of [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] being perceived and born there. Maybe something wants to arise, but it just gets dismissed because the view is, "Well, that is not reality. The thing is just x." This all might be barely conscious. "It is just material," so any view I have or any sense I might have of something else just gets kind of aborted immediately or even before it reaches any kind of [[birth]]. ^4-2
###### 4-3
And then if there is [[eros]], and eros wants more always, we said, that more, because there is only really one dimension operating there, the [[logos]] only allows one dimension and that dimension is the material, that is the only reality, so the more that eros wants, as we said in its basic definition, a simple definition, the more is forced, it is forced to look for that more, find that more, only at that one dimension of the material. It is [[Constriction|constrained]] to that one material dimension, and so it must go, for example, to something physical. Where else could it go? Some physical act. In the realm of [[sexuality]], it must go to the physical act. Or maybe something else, I need to buy something and make it material or get more of this or that physical, material thing. Eros' more, the pothos in the eros, the more movement in the eros, can only move horizontally at one dimension. ^4-3
###### 4-4
And then what happens, for example, in relationship, in relationship to - could be anything, any other, whether it is a lover or a spouse or a physical thing that we wanted and were enamored with, when the [[eros]] can only go into the physical, and whatever we can do with this thing physically, seen in one dimension, when that is exhausted, the physical acts are exhausted, then what happens? What can the eros do? The eros needs fuel. Maybe the flame gets extinguished. Without the fuel, the flame of eros just dies out. This can happen as one of the possibilities, and sometimes it can happen almost pervasively in a person's life. You can see something was alive in the childhood and through the teenage years and adolescence, and the flame of eros there perhaps in all kinds of ways - questioning and aliveness and stretching things. And then maybe in the 20s, maybe in the 30s, maybe even the 40s or the 50s, something - it is just lost fuel. Sometimes it is in the [[logos]], in the limitation of ideation, that does not give enough fuel for the eros, and the flame is extinguished. Or maybe, as I said, it is forced out - for instance, I am in this relationship, or with a marriage or something, and I am only seeing it one-dimensionally, or the [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] are very limited, let us put it that way, in terms of who is this person, how rich, how deep are they potentially to me. Maybe they are not just material, maybe they have a certain kind of [[Centre|interiority]] that we grant people and their sort of psychological complexity in a sort of typical modernist view. But the dimensions are limited. And then what happens? If there is eros, wants more, where does it go? It has to maybe go to other partners. Have to find someone else, because I can only go at one dimension. I can not go deeper into this beloved. There is no deeper. I disallow it. The logos disallows it. So I go looking elsewhere. ^4-4
###### 5-1
Or maybe there is some other area in my life where I go and I take up this or that something, and maybe that is an area where the [[logos]] actually allows a certain expansion, maybe. Maybe it is rich. Or maybe it just goes again into acquiring material things. So there was this thing, and I was enamored with it, but because that thing, whatever it is, I do not know, a possession, a house even, it is only one-dimensional, it can only really be one-dimensional, then I need to acquire something else. I need to acquire material things or status or something. The more can only move on one-dimensional, very limited [[Dimensionality|dimensions]]. There is no vertical depth, other dimensions for it to expand into. ^5-1
###### 5-2
Now, I wonder about something - just thinking about - I wonder about something like pornography, or pornography addiction, stuff like that. I do not know; I have actually never been into pornography. But I wonder whether, again, part of what sometimes happens there is that there is, one is caught, the person engaging in that is caught in a limited [[dimensionality]], just seeing matter in a very flat way. Or perhaps there is a split between where other dimensions are alive in their life and there is a sort of [[spirituality]], but there is a split between spirituality and [[sexuality]]. So in relation to sexuality, it is not spiritual, it does not have the possibility of feeling, sensing, perceiving, knowing, conceiving other dimensions within sexuality. So there is a split. You know, I would not want to speculate, but again, one [[Wonder|wonders]] about abuse within the church and the clergy where people are - you know, sometimes spiritual teachings that do divorce the sexual from the spiritual in ways that do not allow a dimensionality in relation to sexuality. Or the person just has a materialistic view in the first place, a one-dimensional view. ^5-2
###### 5-3
So all this, you know, pornography feels [[Soul|soulless]]; why? Well, it is. In our language, it is. It is exactly that. It feels soulless because it is soulless. Meaning there is no possibility there for the [[imaginal]]. There is lots of possibility for the imaginary, but no possibility for the imaginal, for the sense of [[dimensionality]], of depth, of mystery, in the [[Embodiment|body]], in the [[beauty]], in the [[sexuality]], et cetera. There is really an objectification in the sense of narrowing down this or that object or other to just one dimension. There is an absence of soul, a poverty of [[psyche]], a poverty of [[image]]. And when that is the case, then we get what we might call greed. It is got nowhere to move, no depth in which to move. It may - again, I do not know; part of this is just kind of wondering out loud - it may be that someone who is into pornography, you know, there is not an absence of [[metta]] there. So I am thinking of actually two people, students who shared with me their (what they would term) pornography addiction. Both of them had quite a degree of kindness and metta. So it is not an absence of metta. But something is blocked in the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]]. It is blocked from its natural inclination to expand, blocked by some kind of [[logos]] that either just sees one-dimensionally or does not allow [[spirituality]] or dimensionality in to meet and to infuse the sense of sexuality and physicality. ^5-3
###### 5-4
So we could say, in other words, with something like pornography, maybe there is no [[psyche]] or [[logos]] beyond a one-[[dimensionality]] with respect to the other, certainly with respect to self, the world, with respect also to the [[eros]] itself. So that fourfold self-other-world-eros, that fourfold sort of confluence or co-constellation. The psyche and logos with respect to each and all of them is limited to being one-dimensional and to being reified: "It is this. This is the truth. I am like this," et cetera. "[[Sexuality]] is like this," whatever. So that in our language, the small definition of eros, the initial impetus, if it is there, if that is moving in a person, if they have a lot of libido and life force and there is that eros, the logos and the psyche wo not allow the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos]] to expand and it goes perhaps, if it is there, it will go just into some kind of greed or pleasure seeking, et cetera. It has to stay at that one level. Limited. ^5-4
###### 6-1
Now, actually, we could say any prioritizing of one dimension or level of being, existence, [[perception]], any shrinking of that vertical spectrum of the [[imaginal]], whether it is to a so-called purely material level in the way that [[modernism]] kind of conceives of it or senses it, or whether it is even some other kind of elevated, ethereal, almost disembodied level or whatever, any prioritizing or shrinking down to one dimension or level of that vertical spectrum of the imaginal, and a belief with that, "This or that level is what is really real," any of that will limit [[soulmaking]]. It is the openness of the sense of multidimensionality that encourages, supports, stimulates soulmaking, and conversely soulmaking opens up that sense of multidimensionality. As always, there is a mutual dependence there. ^6-1
###### 6-2
As we are talking, and I think I might have said this before, we can get the sense that [[eros]], [[psyche]], [[logos]], we can talk of them as if they are three almost separate things that come into interaction, mutual insemination, et cetera, or we can just as well say they are facets, three facets of one dynamic, of one process, three facets of [[soulmaking]]. And this soulmaking and these three facets, they can be open and creative, or any of those three - the eros, the psyche, the logos - could be constricted somehow and then when any of them is constricted, any how, it can hinder or block the whole movement of the soulmaking. So the whole process, the whole dynamism gets stuck, the whole dynamic gets stuck at some point, at some stage, rigidified, ossified, blocked, cramped. ^6-2
###### 6-3
So there is so many possibilities here. But for instance, what happens again in relationship with a beloved - any kind of beloved - if the [[logos]], the idea, the conception of what a [[Personhood|human being]] is generally - in this case, what this person is - is limited, either psychologically...  In other words, limited in the way that a lot of modern psychotherapy might consider a person. Certainly they are complex, certainly they are a result of past conditioning and family influences and cultural influences and all that. So it is a view. And we acknowledge and we feel nowadays with [[modernism]] a certain [[Centre|interiority]], as I mentioned before, to what a human being is, that a human being has, that perhaps in many cases they did not have that sense at other times in [[history]]. But still, with all that, even with that kind of interiority, even with that kind of psychology, Freud's psychology or anything that came out of that, a lot of modern psychotherapy, there is still often - not always, but often - a kind of limit to the logos of what a human being is. And that can function as a block, as a limit. It limits the [[soulmaking]] movement, the soulmaking growth and expansion. ^6-3
###### 6-4
Or it might be just the idea of this particular individual; I have a limited, fixed idea of who or how they are. Or my idea, my [[logos]], my [[conceptual framework]] that is operating of relationship, or of [[eros]], what eros is, or of sex and [[sexuality]] and that movement. I have a limited idea, whatever it is. Actually one of these students who considers himself to have a pornography addiction said to me, "Sex is just biological instinct. It is just biological instinct." It is a certain limited logos of what sex is. But even ones that sound like they are more generous and richer and more heartful - "Sex is the expression of [[love]]," or "The sexual impulse is a spiritual impulse towards union" - all of them may have some validity, but when it is limited in that way, that, too, that limited idea is a limited logos, and that will limit the [[soulmaking]] possible. Or in relation to sex, "This is how it should be," some idea of how sex should be, which would include then a [[clinging]] to an idea or an [[image]], a self-image, the [[psyche]] there of my sexuality, how I am sexually, my sexual identity, and that maybe has got narrowed down or rigidified in all kinds of ways - character or performance or all kinds of stuff. But there the logos or the image, the psyche in regard to my sexuality has become rigid or limited or both. And then again, the eros actually is hindered. The eros in its wish to expand actually gets hindered, blocked. ^6-4
###### 6-5
So you can see how many, maybe perhaps infinite ways the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]] can get blocked and limited. Perhaps we could say that. It is infinite. Whether it is basically either because of the [[eros]] being hindered, or the [[psyche]], or the [[logos]], or some combination of those, the permutations individually are infinite, perhaps. So we could also, for instance, [[Clinging|cling]] to the [[image]] of another, a certain image we have of another, and we neglect to see, we fail to see that this image that I have of this other is dependent on my [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]]. We believe and we act and we assume that the way we are seeing them, the image we have of them, is independent of the way of looking that one is employing at any time. There is a reification of that image. Or again, of marriage. "Marriage is this." We have a certain image of what marriage is. Or a certain logos of what marriage is. And all this can prevent in different ways, stifle and limit the expansion, the deepening and widening, the fertilizing of the [[soulmaking]]. ^6-5
###### 7-1
Now, of course, in actual relationship with another, the [[soulmaking]] in relationship, for the relationship to be a fertile field for soulmaking, for the continuing fire of the [[eros]] in that relationship between the two there or in a community or whatever, it needs a basis in actuality. So of course it needs a basis in taking care of our communication, really making sure the communication is skillful and supportive and helpful and caring. It needs a basis in [[Metta|kindness]], in [[love]]. We need to voice love, express love, express [[appreciation]]. And without that kind of basis, the [[soulmaking dynamic]] will founder; it wo not have enough basis, generally speaking. Again, it will be limited without that basis at another level, if you like. ^7-1
###### 7-2
But sometimes other things happen in relationship or are blocked in relationship. Sometimes the [[eros]] of one partner has a depth to it and a fire to it that is not matched by the other. Has an aliveness to it and a range to it that is not matched by the other partner. The spark and the fullness of the eros either is just inherently not matched, they are just different personalities, or in one of the partners the eros is blocked. So it is actually there somehow, but for different reasons - can be very complex - the eros is actually blocked, so one partner, their eros is flowing and the flame is burning and very alive, and the other, it is just not, and there is a mismatch. And sometimes what happens is the [[logos]] and the [[psyche]], the ideation, the concepts and the [[Image|images]] that perhaps were shared, the ideas about life, about relationship, about being, the ideas and images that were shared, no longer overlap. Or perhaps there is not enough overlap to start with, and so there is not enough fuel for the mutual eros to burn. It can not really go anywhere with that. So the eros again gets limited, gets stifled, does not have the opportunity to grow. ^7-2
###### 7-3
Or, you know, again, for really all kinds of reasons, something in him, something in her, in the relationship - again, I do not have to make it as if it is objectively existing or not existing in them, but something in him or her, in this relational constellation, in this [[perception]], in this dependent co-arising of the relationship, something in him or her does not allow the deepening of the [[psyche]], the deepening of the [[imaginal]] dimension in relationship to him or her. There is a limit to how - my sense of their [[soul]] does not open into more mystery, more [[dimensionality]], more depth. And it is complex. The psychology here is complex in relation to all this and in relation, you know, why that happens, so that there is a limitation on this [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]]. ^7-3
###### 7-4
Let us make it clear. When we talk about [[logos]], when we talk about ideas or concepts, by nature, their nature is to limit. They define and [[Delineations|delineate]]. That is the nature of ideas. That in itself is not a problem. We touched on this a little bit, sort of obliquely, in an earlier talk. But that is the nature of logoi, of concepts, of ideas, is they limit, the delimit and the define and they delineate. No problem. That is just how they function. The problem, from a [[soulmaking]] perspective, is when the limit of a logos is reached with respect to the sense of the other, with respect to the idea of the other, of self, of world, of humans in general, of the [[soul]], of [[psyche]], of [[eros]] itself, of [[divinity]]. With respect to any of that, when a certain logos that is in place, when the limit of that is reached, and it does not allow the ongoing expansion or deepening of the [[soulmaking dynamic]], and when the limit is inflexible - so it reaches, just like hitting a wall, and the wall will not shatter because it is just entrenched, whatever this idea is, and it wo not stretch, so it wo not stretch or shatter to allow more space or more territory for the play of this dynamic of eros-psyche-logos playing together, the soulmaking fecundity and fertilization; there is just something wants to expand but the limit is reached. So it is not the fact that ideas, logoi, concepts are limited and limiting by their nature. That is not the problem, because that is always the case. That is how they work, as I said. ^7-4
###### 7-5
Really what is at stake here, what the issue is, is where is the [[soul]]'s process right now in relation to the limits of the concepts and ideas, the logoi that are in place? Where is my [[soulmaking]] process at, that intermingling of [[image]] and [[eros]] and ideation in relation to the limits that are in place of the [[logos]]? ^7-5
###### 8-1
What is the expanse that is created by my [[Conceptual Framework|conceptual structure]]? Do I still have, does the [[soul]], if you like, and the [[soulmaking]] process still have more room within the limits, the playground created by a certain conceptual structure or conceptual framework, a certain [[logos]]? Or have I already filled it? Has the soul already explored that whole territory, that whole playground, and needs to expand? It wants more, and the more cannot be provided by the limits of that playground. So that is really the question at any moment in time. Not so much even what the logos is or how it relates to someone else's logos or anything like that. It is really a question of relative pacing, if you like, of expansion, between the different elements, if you like, of the soulmaking process. If the [[image]] wants to expand and the [[eros]] wants to expand, the logos is limiting it, that is a problem, if it wants to expand beyond what the logos can allow. ^8-1
###### 8-2
So with all this, you know, I hope you are getting the sense - when we talk about [[logos]] or concept or idea, we are not talking about something abstract. In a way, that is kind of irrelevant. The word abstract actually means to remove, ab, from, to take from, to remove. So it is like, we are not talking about something removed from life, removed from [[perception]] and [[experience]] and [[embodiment]] and living. And again, we are talking about something that is always operating. So certainly a concept, an idea, a logos can be abstract, and in terms of practice, when we talk about [[ways of looking]] in [[meditation]], whether it is to do with [[emptiness]] and [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]] or whether it is to do with [[soulmaking]], we need to actually - we are talking about practicing entertaining different concepts, different conceptual structures, different logoi, in ways that actually flow into, actually inform, actually shape a way of looking so that they can be soulmaking. We are not talking about just thinking something sort of intellectually in a way that does not come into the way of looking, in a way that actually affects one's life. ^8-2
###### 8-3
So sometimes - this is a really important point; sometimes people do not get the connection here. ^8-3
###### 8-4
"Why is he talking so much about ideas?" And actually find it hard to bring an idea in to bear on the actual sensing and seeing and [[embodiment]] and life and [[perception]]. So we can not just assume that they do, because it might just be we are just entertaining this idea abstractly, we are just listening, "Ah, that is very interesting. Fascinating," but it is not actually - we need a way to bring an idea into the world that we live, in the way that we live, to the perception. Ideas are there anyway, as I said. What we are interested in is this flexibility of concepts and [[ways of looking]] and plugging them in, moving between them, again in ways that make a difference. Really what I mean by all this is not so much the abstract logoi, but the logoi, the concepts that are actually lived, that are alive. If they are unconscious, can I make them conscious? And if they are stuck, can I bring in new ones and fresh ones and develop that flexibility? So we are talking about the concepts that are lived, that are alive, that are embodied, and that actually involve and affect the heart and the [[experience]] and the perception. ^8-4
###### 8-5
Even more than that, I would add playing with different ideas and [[Conceptual Framework|conceptual frameworks]] and actually entertaining them in this way that I am talking about, in the [[perception]], in the [[experience]], and more than that, creating them, forging them as we are doing now, this process, both the flexibility of entertaining them but also building new ones, that is [[soulmaking]]. That process of engaging with the creativity of conceptuality, of idea, of [[mind]], is itself part of soulmaking. It stimulates soulmaking. It supports the inflaming of the [[eros]] and the increase of the [[psyche]]. ^8-5
###### 8-6
You can see how much idea comes in, ideation comes in to our lives. So, for instance, [[Devotion|faith]], you know, is a certain ideation, we could say. Many different kinds here. But for example, in relation to some personal difficulty that is arisen in my life or that I might be going through, or some pattern I have in the personality that is difficult, or something that befalls my [[Embodiment|body]] or me, and the idea, the [[logos]], that it is somehow necessary to [[soul]]. It is an idea. Or that it somehow has divine roots, that it mirrors something divine. These are ideas. But if I can plug them in, just play with that a little bit, they make the [[experience]] rich. They make the personal difficulty - they give it depth and [[dimensionality]]. They make it feel necessary. They make it [[imaginal]], and eventually divine. So logos affects [[perception]], affects the [[image]], the lived image we have of what we deal with, ourselves and the things that befall us and make ourselves up. ^8-6
###### 9-1
And then something interesting, because we talk a lot in the [[Dharma]] of relating to this [[pain]] or that pain, or this difficulty or that difficulty with [[metta]], metta to myself who has to go through this, has to bear this, metta even to the [[phenomenon]] of the pain (talked about that on different [[Retreat|retreats]]), but there is a possibility of not just metta but of [[eros]] then in relationship to a difficulty. There is the possibility that this sense of the difficulty is enriched, given [[Dimensionality|dimensions]], et cetera; does not just [[Emptiness|fade]]. I do not just hold it in kindness, and I do not just find [[ways of looking]] that it fades. All of which is really valid. But there is also a sense of eros in relationship to one's own personal difficulties and the difficult events of one's existence, of one's life. ^9-1
###### 9-2
So we talked about amor fati on the Re-enchanting [[retreat]], The [[Poetry]] of [[Perception]], the [[love]] of one's fate, and what allows that, what allows that to actually be a lived and heartfelt, [[soul]]-felt [[experience]]. We could say, in relation to anything, anything at all, in relation to any thing, a view that reduces it - say psychologically; a view of psychological reduction - wo not lead to [[soulmaking]], or will lead to a very limited kind of soulmaking and very limited, then, expansion of the sense of [[Divinity|sacredness]] in life but in relation to that thing. It still may be very helpful. You know, psychological [[reductionism]], other kinds of reductionsim can still be very helpful, very helpful in relation to this or that difficulty. Wo not lead to soulmaking. ^9-2
###### 9-3
Wo not lead, wo not allow, because of the [[reductionism]] of the view there, of the [[logos]], it wo not support this expansion, this growth, this organic and potentially limitless growth - unless the very psychological difficulties we have, and the obstacles we have, and the personal difficulties, and the difficult events in our life, or things that befall us, unless they too are seen as [[Image|images]], unless they become [[imaginal]]. So the very psychology itself and the difficulty itself become images, or the logos that sees them allows them to become images. Then they become re-enchanted. I think [[Catherine McGee|Catherine]]'s talk was called Re-enchanting [[Dukkha]]. It needs this, needs to become, the very dukkha, the logos that I have of it needs to somehow - either in the logos of the thing itself, that I am not psychologically reducing it, or I am considering it psychologically but that whole psychology has its other levels of mirroring, necessity of [[soul]] and divine purpose, et cetera. In other words, what happens in my childhood, what happens in my life, the journey that I am, if you like, guided into, [[Constriction|constrained]] into by the circumstance of my life, that also is given other imaginal [[Dimensionality|dimensions]]. Then yes, this thing might be a result of my psychology or expressing that, but the whole thing has another imaginal dimension. The dukkha is re-enchanted. ^9-3
