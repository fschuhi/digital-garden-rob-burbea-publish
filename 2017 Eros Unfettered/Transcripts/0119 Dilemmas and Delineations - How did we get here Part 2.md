If we just briefly sum up: why <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>? Why make this delineation? Well, yes, because it's part of our life already, as should become more and more really evident. There's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> involved in our relationship with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> and with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>. To different degrees, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is involved in our relationship with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> and the notion of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>. Therefore, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> needs to be investigated there, because it's part of my path, because it's involved in my relationship with it. It's certainly part of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> is certainly part of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>. And, as I said, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> involves and leads to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, and widening of the senses of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span> beyond just the 'is-ness' of things, and even beyond the transcendence that's possible for us, for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, transcendence in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a></span>. And opening up <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span> wider than a kind of universal <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span>. We've talked about this on other <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span>, and we'll go into this on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. There's a kind of universal <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span>, and then there's particular <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span>, theophanies, that preserve particularities<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > Recap Why eros why this delineation" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Recap Why eros why this delineation" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1

I'm just recapping here. There's also the making the link between <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">sacredness</a></span>, that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> are not just defilements. We want a path that has more than nothing to say, or very little to say, about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span> and about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="romantic love" class="internal-link">romantic love</a></span>, that recognizes there's more involved, certainly than procreation, and also than _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettƒÅ</a></span>_<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > Sexuality and eros are not just defilements" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Sexuality and eros are not just defilements" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2
###### 1-3
Before I venture a first definition/delineation of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, I want to say a few things, three or four things generally about this definition, but also about making definitions and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="delineations" class="internal-link">delineations</a></span> in general. So firstly (and it's implicit in what I've been saying, I think, already), people use the word <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> - if they use it at all in psychological or other contexts - in many different ways, and over the millennia, in fact, it's been used to mean many different things. There's a range in how people use it. It's important to be aware of that. We are certainly not saying we have the right definition and everyone else is wrong; that would be utterly ridiculous. It's really not about right or wrong. It's more, for me, about what does _this_ way of defining <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> lead to? Different ways of defining <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> unfold in different directions, if you like<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > Different ways of defining eros unfold in different directions" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Different ways of defining eros unfold in different directions" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3
###### 1-4
The way we're defining <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> sits within a certain <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span> of other things that I've mentioned, and a whole set of teachings. So what does that whole set move towards, and how does this notion of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> - how is it supported by that other set, and how does it support that other whole <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>? Really not about right or wrong or arguing with people, but it's important to say this is just one among many possible ways. The way I'm going to define it in a minute is one among many possible ways. The way we're going to define it over this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, actually, is one among many possible ways. But it's also a delineation that's based on, if you like, a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a></span> approach, meaning just the observation of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> and what's actually happening in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. But that observation is already informed and based on certain directions in practice to do with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understandings</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, and also <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span> and notions of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">Phenomenological</a></span> observation is always informed by a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>. But the definitions we're using are based on, really, what is observed in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> in that territory<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > This delineation of eros is based on a phenomenological approach" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#This delineation of eros is based on a phenomenological approach" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4
###### 1-5
So, not about right or wrong. That's the first thing. But what's it serving? And how can we define it in a way that serves our purposes? Second thing is a more general thing about definitions and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="delineations" class="internal-link">delineations</a></span> in general. It has to do with something that philosophers call the 'hermeneutic circle.' '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hermeneutics > Overview" data-href="Hermeneutics#Overview" class="internal-link">Hermeneutics</a></span>' is a word that basically means 'interpretation.' It emerged as a word in terms of the study of sacred texts and descriptions of what does it actually mean, this text; how should we interpret when the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> said _this_, or in some <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tantra" data-href="Tantra" class="internal-link">tantric</a></span> texts it says _that_, or actually the Bible or whatever. So it has to do with parts and wholes, in a way. If I'm looking at a text, or if I have this concept of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, it's one part within a much larger whole. So this word that I want to interpret in the text, the word is part of a much larger group of words that make up the text, and the text itself is part of a much larger, probably, group of texts, or stream of tradition, or historical context or whatever. And I can't fully understand the part unless I understand the whole<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > Hermeneutical circle" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Hermeneutical circle" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-5
###### 2-1
So in this case, we can't actually take <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> on its own and sort of understand _that_ without <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> the other parts of a bigger whole of what we're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a></span> this integrated vision of practice, integrated <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span> or architecture of practice that involves <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> practices, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. I can't really take it on its own, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, separate from those, and hope to understand it. But similarly, the conundrum of the hermeneutic circle is [that] I can't understand the whole until I understand the particular parts. So I certainly won't understand the whole text unless I understand the individual words within it, and I won't even understand this text unless I see and have a bigger <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of the tradition and the group of texts that it involves. This applies, actually, to everything. It even applies to our <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a></span>, to understand or to move closer, if you like, to an <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> meant, we actually need to understand the whole of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> and the whole of his <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, because <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> is situated within that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, and its meaning, and its directions, and what it draws on, and the assumptions and all of that, has a place, has a context. I can't really understand <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> until I've understood the whole of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, if you like, and what the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> shaped with that and opened with that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > The conundrum of the hermeneutic circle using the example of understanding mindfulness as part of the Dharma" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#The conundrum of the hermeneutic circle using the example of understanding mindfulness as part of the Dharma" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
Similarly, I can't really understand the whole of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> unless I understand the individual elements of it. It's the same here in relation to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> is, as I said, tied in with a whole other web of concepts, and to take it out on its own and try and define it is actually not really, strictly speaking, possible. It's still helpful, and that's what I'm going to do as a start, but it's tied in with other notions, ideas, concepts, and experiences. Everything that I say so far, all these words that I've just sometimes thrown out without fully explaining, it will all get elaborated over the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. Because of this problem with the hermeneutic circle, what's called the hermeneutic circle, because of this contextualization and relationship, and the place that something like <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> takes within a larger set and framework of ideas and experiences, etc., it means that we're going to have to move back and forth between a sort of small vision, big vision, and tie things together. So really, we're going to elaborate what <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> means over quite a long time, and ask for your patience with that, but it's kind of necessary. That will give us a much richer, deeper, fuller <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> that's actually much more helpful<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > Eros is tied in with other notions concepts and experiences" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Eros is tied in with other notions concepts and experiences" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
The third thing about definition, in relation to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> specifically, is that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> classically is a god, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>, and divinities are by their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> not fully fathomable, not fully capturable in concept. They have some kind of infinitude to them, and so they're not fully definable. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't venture certain concepts. And I'll explain this much more later, why (A) we can't avoid <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptuality</a></span>, and (B), actually <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptuality</a></span> is necessary and part of the erotic movement. This is the thing: an expanding, not a limited or fixed or stuck <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptuality</a></span>; that's where the rub comes. It's not that we just say, "Oh, it's divine. It's infinite. It's undefinable," and we just shrug and forget about it. Then we don't amplify that. It doesn't come alive to us as an area of interest. But we _can_ use concepts. We don't hope to ever completely capture it and say, "That's it. That's my definition. Watertight, very neat, thank you very much." Maybe in some traditions actually <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> is a semi-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>, a sort of demi-god, in between the divine and the not divine, if you like. And that may also allow us to be [more conceptual], part of the reason why we can be more conceptual, or at least approach part of it or begin to approach it through some conception. We'll return to all this business about <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptuality</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > Eros like the demi-god is not fully capturable in concept" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Eros like the demi-god is not fully capturable in concept" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 3-1
But having said all that about caveats and qualifications and all that, and complications about definitions, let's start with a really simple definition, okay? Or a relatively simple definition. This is just to start, just to get us started, bearing in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> that we can't capture it completely, bearing in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> that it involves lots of other concepts, etc., and it's not right or wrong, all that. Let's start with a really relatively simple definition. I'll say <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. It's a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. It's a wanting, but wanting _what_? It wants, let's say, more contact. It wants more contact, more connection, with what we could call its object, or whatever erotic object we're talking about. We're going to use that language a lot. 'Erotic object' means what <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is in relationship to, or the 'beloved,' if you like, if you want that more poetic language<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > Eros is a kind of desire for more contact" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Eros is a kind of desire for more contact" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> wants more, let's say, contact and connection with the erotic object. Now, because these words, 'contact,' and especially 'connection,' have become so sort of used, they've almost lost their power. So I'm going to elaborate this a little bit. It wants more contact and connection. It wants to touch the erotic object more. These words I'm using really quite broadly. What does it mean to touch? Does 'touch' just mean the skin touching something? Certainly it means that, but it means much more. What does it mean to touch? Think, think of the fullness of that word, and how we can touch things, what <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span> of our being and our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span> can touch things. It wants to touch. It wants to touch more of the erotic object. It wants to know more. It wants to know the object more. It wants to know the beloved more. And again, that word, 'know' - think of the fullness of what that word means: I want to know you. I'm really using the words quite broadly here. It wants to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> more of the beloved, more of the erotic object. So it has to do with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, intimacy. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> is a wanting to penetrate the erotic object more, to open more to the beloved, to open to more of the erotic object, to penetrate more of the erotic object, to penetrate more<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > Eros is a wanting to penetrate the erotic object more" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Eros is a wanting to penetrate the erotic object more" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
These words - 'penetrate,' 'open,' maybe 'know' - these are also words with sexual connotations, right? That's deliberate. It's not _limited_ to that (and we're going to come back to these words in particular), but using these words broadly: <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is the wanting of more contact, more connection, more touch, more knowing, more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of, to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> more of, to have more intimacy, more penetration, more opening to the erotic object or beloved. Now, that erotic object could be _anything_ - anything so-called outer or inner. The erotic object, the object of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, can be anything. And notice, also, about this simple definition for now, notice that word, 'more.' I put a lot of emphasis on that word, 'more.' I don't know the myth from the classical myth, but <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> always goes along with - I think he's another god called Pothos. Pothos is another Greek word. And Pothos is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Infinity" data-href="Infinity" class="internal-link">the infinite</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> or the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> for <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Infinity" data-href="Infinity" class="internal-link">the infinite</a></span>. It's the 'more.' This is the 'more.' Pothos has something like it always wants to move on. When it's got something, it wants more, more, more. So I'm going to say that that pothos is a part of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. When we talk about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, it implies and involves and has as an intrinsic element pothos, and that's the 'more.' It wants more touching, more knowing of, more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of, more penetration, more opening to<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > Eros goes together with Pothos" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Eros goes together with Pothos" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3
###### 4-1
You might be like, "Well, that's not a very interesting definition." It's quite a humble definition, in a way. It's really starting quite simple. And in some senses, it's quite a broad definition, and in others it's quite narrow. You might think, "That's a bit of a disappointing definition," or maybe not a big deal. But my contention, what I hope you will at some point be convinced by, is actually the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> of this way of defining it, and that you will begin to see - slowly, hopefully more and more - the power of it as a way of thinking about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, that it has all kinds of implications and consequences that emerge from it, that are kind of wrapped up not so obviously, but are intrinsic to it, and create, if you like, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> and the fullness, and the richness and the multidirectionality of what <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> actually _is_ and what it _does_<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > The definition may sound a bit dull but it allows for richness and multidirectionality" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#The definition may sound a bit dull but it allows for richness and multidirectionality" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-1
###### 4-2
Okay. So again, notice again, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is _not_ - we're _not_ defining it as, or rather we're saying it's _not_ the same as <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span> or sexual attraction or sexual <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>. It includes that, in our definition. That's certainly part of it, and you can [hear] - it's wanting more touch, more penetration, more openness, to know, to be intimate, so <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span> is one dimension of that, or one manifestation of that, at a certain level and in a certain direction. We're not, also, equating it with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sigmund Freud" data-href="Sigmund Freud" class="internal-link">Freud</a></span>'s pleasure principle, the seeking of pleasure and pleasant sensations, which would be akin to one of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s lists of what <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> involves. So that's certainly involved, pleasure is involved (I'm going to come back to this) in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, but it's not actually what <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is after.

In some instances, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is the bigger concept - for instance, in relation to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span>. In other instances of these other definitions, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> would be the smaller concept.

But also notice something else. In some traditions, ancient traditions, and it's continued to this very day - I think it came either from the Platonic teachings (I don't know enough about it), or from the Neoplatonic tradition. For instance, there was a mystic and a sage and a philosopher with the wonderful name of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dionysius the Areopagite" class="internal-link">Dionysius the Areopagite</a></span>. Actually, the guy that I'm talking about had the even _more_ wonderful name of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dionysius the Areopagite" data-href="Dionysius the Areopagite" class="internal-link">Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite</a></span>, because, it seems, for very complex reasons, he was pretending to be the other guy, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dionysius the Areopagite" class="internal-link">Dionysius the Areopagite</a></span>, who had lived a few hundred years before that. Anyway. _This_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dionysius the Areopagite" class="internal-link">Dionysius the Areopagite</a></span>, among other teachers, defines <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> as really that force that moves towards <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a></span>, towards union, towards melting in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>, etc. So we are _not_ defining it that way. This is important. And this is quite common in some psychologies and some spiritual teachings these days. There's a _relationship_ between this movement towards <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a></span>, but actually it's more complex<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > Eros is also defined here as movement towards oneness" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Eros is also defined here as movement towards oneness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-4
###### 4-5
Going back to our definition: <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, this wanting for more contact, more connection, more touching, more knowing, more experiencing, more intimacy, more penetrating and opening to the beloved or the erotic object. So there's a relationship with the movement towards unifying, but - and we're going to elaborate this - <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> will _always_ want more. It will always want more, more of this connecting, touching, etc., opening to, which means that either it will, if you like, resurrect a twoness - it will resurrect the beloved object after an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> or union - or it creates or discovers _more_ of the other, other othernesses, other things to reach towards in the object; it complexifies it. I'm going to explain this much more. Or it simply does not go towards union. It does not move towards dissolution, towards union, towards melting, towards a collapsing of the twoness into <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>. So either it _does_, but then it will re-instigate, actually create or discover (this is something we'll come back to) other othernesses, or recreate a kind of more of the beloved other, so to speak, to move towards, or it will simply not. It will resist somehow that collapse to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>. It will preserve the twoness, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> and the erotic other, the erotic object, the beloved. Much more about that later. But this is a really, really important point<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > Eros does not move towards dissolution i e it will either resurrect a twoness after unification or discover more otherness" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Eros does not move towards dissolution i e it will either resurrect a twoness after unification or discover more otherness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-5

So how do we recognize <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>? How do we recognize the presence of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> in our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, in our life, in our meditations, in our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span>? I remember teaching many years ago - well, a few years ago - and giving some instructions on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind state" data-href="Mind state" class="internal-link">mind states</a></span>, emphasizing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> of developing sensitivity to how the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind state" class="internal-link">mind state</a></span> was sort of reflected in and affected the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and the experiences in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, and also just the general texture of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> space. My two co-teachers commented afterwards and said that they thought some people just would never be able to do that or couldn't do that, and a much better way of going about it was to say that you recognize the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind state" class="internal-link">mind state</a></span> through the thoughts. The kind of thoughts you have tell you what <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind state" class="internal-link">mind state</a></span> you're in, so if you have angry thoughts, you know that you're angry, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > How do we recognize eros" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#How do we recognize eros" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1

All I can say for now - and actually, for the way that I would conceive of this whole set of teachings and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> in general - is that as practitioners, we need to develop our sensitivity and the subtlety of our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> to be able to notice <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind state" data-href="Mind state" class="internal-link">mind states</a></span>. If we're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind state" class="internal-link">mind state</a></span> or a state of being, to develop the sensitivity to that without relying on the clues and cues of thoughts. Seeing how the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> is affected, developing the sensitivity to that, to the textures of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, and what we might call the space of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, the subtle mental movements that are there even when there is no thought, or they're underneath or alongside thought. So I, in a way, stand by that, in the sense that I can't really see how the kinds of things we're talking about, and the capacity to work with them in practice, would even be remotely possible without those kinds of sensitivities. We're talking about developing practice in a way that demands quite a lot, and one of the basic things it demands is a sensitivity to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, and a more subtle sensitivity in general to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > We need to develop the sensitivity to the texture of mind states and the space of mind" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#We need to develop the sensitivity to the texture of mind states and the space of mind" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2
###### 5-3
But this ties in to a point anyway that I've said before and will repeat again: when we talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, like everything, we're talking about a spectrum. It can be incredibly intense and, in a way, quite gross and obvious, or really, really quite subtle. Somehow we want, if we're going to explore it and investigate it and include it as part of our reach of what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> means and our practice means and our path means, then we're going to have to be sensitive, and recognize its presence, and be able to work with it across that whole realm of subtlety and intensity. That means that we can handle and work with and not get bowled over with really intense <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> (and we'll come back to that whole question about balance, etc.), and also that we can recognize and work with it when it's really very subtle, and that that's still recognizable, sensible, and fruitful<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > Like everything eros is happening on a spectrum" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Like everything eros is happening on a spectrum" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-3
###### 6-1
Also, you'll notice, kind of implicit in the definition, and part of recognizing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, is that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> involves attraction. There is attraction in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. It wants more, more X, Y, Z, as we said. So attraction is implicitly part, the force of attraction that one can recognize in oneself and feel and actually explore: it's attracted to _what_? But included in that, or because of that, or with that attraction, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> has this felt tension in it. So <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> usually involves some degree of tension, often because of the 'more' (it always wants more), and/or because, as I mentioned, the attraction towards the erotic object is not dissolved, or if it's dissolved, it's only temporarily dissolved in union. There's an element in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, if you like, that preserves the otherness, and therefore the tension of the two and the tension of the attraction. The attraction doesn't lead to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>, either at all, _or_ as a final resting place in which that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> - there's no more tension of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. So always, to say it again, there's the preservation of otherness, or the creation of more otherness, so to speak - more of this object, more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span> of this object and therefore more otherness, or the discovery, if you like, of more to the object, and more to move into with this attraction, with the directionality of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > Eros involves a tension of the attraction towards otherness" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Eros involves a tension of the attraction towards otherness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-1
###### 6-2
You can already see, it's simple, but it's already quite complex. We're going to go into this thing about twoness and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>, and preserving otherness and all that. We're going to go into that more, as I said. But recognizing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. Again, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> often has a certain (what we might call) <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="juiciness" class="internal-link">juiciness</a></span> to it. Now, that's quite interesting too. The word 'libido,' which some people use interchangeably with '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>,' the word 'libido' is related to the word 'lips,' and the moisture of lips, the drippings of pleasure. I'm taking this etymology both from <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="James Hillman" class="internal-link">James Hillman</a></span>,^[James Hillman, _Alchemical Psychology: Uniform Edition, Volume 5_ (Thompson, CT: Spring Publications, 2009), 259] and also from Onians, who wrote a book about the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span> of Western thought and certain concepts, and traces them through <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span>.^[Richard Broxton Onians, _The Origins of European Thought: About the Body, the Mind, the Soul, the World, Time and Fate_ (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1951)] 'Libido' is drippings of pleasure, juices, libation, our word libation, drink, the excitations of lust, the pouring of liquid, as in libation, as I said. _Deliquare_ is to make liquid, to make something a liquid or to melt. It's also related to the Latin word _laetus,_ which is moistness, or fatness, or fruitfulness - that's very key to our definition of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, fruitfulness - and gladness. And also related to the German _lieben,_ which is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, as well as to the word _liber_ in Latin, which means free. And the god Liber was a fertility god, a procreative figure<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > The semantic network of juiciness and libido" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#The semantic network of juiciness and libido" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-2
###### 6-3
It's also related to something you may have heard me say in other talks, about the necessity to make all things liquid. The <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Alchemy" data-href="Alchemy" class="internal-link">alchemical</a></span> maxim, "Don't proceed until all things have been made liquid" - in other words, not reified. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> and its connection with the word libido, all this is wrapped up. Actually, we will be using the word libido - when we even use it - as meaning more something like psychic <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> in general, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>. But anyway, it's related. And <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="juiciness" class="internal-link">juiciness</a></span> seems to be a part of the erotic <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, a part of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. Part of that, part of the reason for <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="juiciness" class="internal-link">juiciness</a></span> is that (and this is something we're going to have to explain in more detail later) <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> always invokes, stimulates, or involves, or is involved with, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> always invokes, is involved with or involves, and stimulates the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. I'll explain more about this later. That process of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> is, in itself, rich, and so <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> brings more richness. This whole process of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> is a rich process and a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Juiciness" data-href="Juiciness" class="internal-link">juicy</a></span> process<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > Dont proceed until all things have been made liquid" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Dont' proceed until all things have been made liquid" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-3

So attraction, tension, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="juiciness" class="internal-link">juiciness</a></span>. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> (I'll come back to that) or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> is part of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> or involved with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. It's part of how we recognize it. All this implies a kind of dynamism. There's the dynamism of the attraction towards the object. That's also recognizable as a feature of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. There's this dynamism of attraction towards the erotic beloved. But there's also the dynamism of what I just referred to and I'll elaborate much more as the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> goes on: this dynamism of the stimulation of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> process, which is a dynamic process. It involves movement, expansion, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">complication</a></span>, enrichment, widening, deepening of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, of what we might call <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>, and also of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptuality</a></span>. So there's a dynamism involved in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> that has to do with that dynamic. It's not always obvious at first. It's the dynamism of the attraction to the object that's more obvious. But actually, what it turns out is the object that we're attracted to is more the complex of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, idea, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> itself. That becomes the object.

But there, as I said, if we're talking about recognizing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, there's attraction, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="juiciness" class="internal-link">juiciness</a></span>, tension, dynamism. Arousal is also a part of the erotic <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. Now, I don't necessarily mean _sexual_ arousal - although of course that's a part of it, can be - or perhaps even measurable or observable psychophysical arousal that a person might measure with electrodes or something or other (may or may not, I don't know). But really the arousal involved with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is an arousal of _interest_. So we talk about the spark as well. There's an arousal of interest. We're really interested in this beloved. Something engages us, compelling in the best sense of the word. It's really captivating, again in the best sense of the word. The interest is aroused. And also the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> is aroused, by which I mean the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> is energized. It will feel energized, it will feel open, and it will probably feel aligned. I've talked about this on past <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span> when we talked about the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, working in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>. But it's also a feature of when there is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> is also aroused. Now, that arousal, again, can be very intense, very, very intense, or really quite subtle. And it may be relatively unagitated. There's quite a peaceful feeling with it, often - not always, but often<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > Arousal of interest and resonances in the energy body" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Arousal of interest and resonances in the energy body" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-1

There's also an aspect, which I think I will leave this to later when we've explained more what I mean by this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking dynamic" data-href="Soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">eros-psyche-logos</a></span>, but I'll just mention it now, of autoeroticism. What becomes for us an erotic object also involves ourselves and involves our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, so the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> itself becomes erotically beautiful to us, our own <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and our selves also. This is what I'm calling 'autoeroticism.' I'll come back to that, hopefully in the next talk<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > Eros directed at eros autoeroticim" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Eros directed at eros autoeroticim" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-2

Now, let's invent another slight delineation here in relation to some of what we just said. I'm going to make up a delineation between two words: delight and bliss. Again, no at all claim that this would be a correct dictionary definition or 'the right definition' or anything like that. Let's say, let's use the term 'delight,' and say that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> usually is accompanied by or involves delight. Delight is involved with erotic <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. By delight, I mean a sense of fullness, of richness, of aliveness, of interest, as we just said. The delight of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, of this enriching process, this expanding process that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> is. We can say axiomatically: the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> loves <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. It's almost a circular definition of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. What's the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>? The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> is what loves <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. It loves this (what I'll explain more) dynamic, this process of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking dynamic" data-href="Soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">eros-psyche-logos</a></span> and their mutual fertilization, expansion, deepening, enriching, widening, so that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> is intrinsically delightful, if you like. And <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, because it goes with all that, it's almost always got a sense of delight with it. You could say that's part of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="juiciness" class="internal-link">juiciness</a></span>, but let's just say that's specific to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> quality<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > The delight of soulmaking" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#The delight of soulmaking" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-3

Now, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> may involve bliss. Again, I'm just making up a definition here, just for our purposes, and defining 'bliss' as an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, of great <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a></span> in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">rapture</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, and that kind of openness, etc., sometimes very intense, sometimes much more subtle. {quote But that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body experience</a></span> of bliss, I would say, accompanies _any_ lightening or unfabricating, to whatever degree, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>-sense, up to a certain point, at least. When we get really deep unfabricating, I'm not sure you can really use the word 'bliss' at all, when you get into the deeper _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhƒÅnas</a></span>_, etc. You can have a bliss without <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, or without delight, or without <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. For example (and I'll come back to this too), the bliss of the first _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhƒÅna</a></span>_ or the third _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhƒÅna</a></span>_ may or may not be <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. In itself, in some ways, it's not, for reasons I'll explain. It's just bliss without <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and without <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> delight, the delight of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. And, of course, sometimes you can have a delight in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> without bliss, quite often, without that sort of strong feeling in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>. But basically, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> usually involves delight, or is accompanied by delight, and it may involve bliss<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > The bliss of soulmaking" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#The bliss of soulmaking" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-4

Okay, so, recognizing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. Again, just to run through those - big spectrum of intensity and subtlety. It involves attraction; that's implicit in it. It includes some kind of felt tension; <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="juiciness" class="internal-link">juiciness</a></span> certainly, a richness of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>; dynamism of different kinds; arousal of interest, of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>; autoeroticism, which I'll come back to; delight usually accompanies it; and it may involve bliss, this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a></span>, rapturous or joyful, peaceful, beautiful <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span> in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>. This is a start into defining <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> in a very simple way, with some caveats. And actually, we're going to see what that does, and expand it, and enrich the very definition or the delineation of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, and really fill it out over the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, put it in relationship to other concepts.

You already see in some of what we're talking about, it's hard to go too far into this without bringing in other elements, or part of this web or this architecture of ideas and experiences and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="delineations" class="internal-link">delineations</a></span> that we're going to try to unfold as part of this wider, integrated, more far-reaching <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span> or path. And so that's what we're going to begin to do: start to draw it together, and draw in some of these ideas, and involve them in each other<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > Now lets draw in some of these ideas and involve them in each other" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Now let's draw in some of these ideas and involve them in each other" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-2
