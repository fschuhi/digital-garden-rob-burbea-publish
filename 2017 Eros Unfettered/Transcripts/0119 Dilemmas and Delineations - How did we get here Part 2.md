[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2]]

<br/>

###### 1-1
Okay, so if we just briefly sum up why [[eros]], why make this delineation: well, yes, because it is part of our life already, as should become more and more really evident. There is eros involved in our relationship with [[Dharma|the path]] and with [[awakening]]. To different degrees, eros is involved in our relationship with the path and awakening and the notion of awakening. Therefore, eros needs to be investigated there, because it is part of my path, because it is involved in my relationship with it. It is certainly part of [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]]. Eros is certainly part of imaginal practice. And, as I said, eros involves and leads to [[soulmaking]] and widening of the senses of [[Divinity|sacredness]] beyond just the 'isness' of things and even beyond the transcendence that is possible for us, for [[consciousness]] - transcendence in [[oneness]] or the [[Unfabricated]]. And opening up sacredness wider than a kind of universal sacredness. We have talked about this on other [[Retreat|retreats]] and we will go into this on this retreat. There is a kind of universal sacredness, and then there is particular sacredness, theophanies, that preserve particularities. ^1-1
###### 1-2
There is also - I am just recapping here - there is also making the link between [[sexuality]] and [[Divinity|sacredness]], that sexuality and [[eros]] are not just defilements. We want a path that has more than nothing to say, or very little to say, about sexuality and about [[romantic love]], that recognizes there is more involved than - certainly than procreation, and also than [[Metta|mettƒÅ]]. ^1-2
###### 1-3
Before I venture a first definition, delineation of [[eros]], I want to say a few things, three or four things generally about this definition but also about making definitions and [[delineations]] in general. So firstly, and it is implicit in what I have been saying I think already, people use the word eros - if they use it at all in psychological or other contexts - in many different ways, and over the millennia in fact it is been used to mean many different things. So there is a range in how people use it. It is important to be aware of that. We are certainly not saying we have the right definition and everyone else is wrong; that would be utterly ridiculous. It is really not about right or wrong. It is more, for me, about what does this way of defining eros lead to. Different ways of defining eros unfold in different directions, if you like. ^1-3
###### 1-4
The way we are defining [[eros]] sits within a certain [[conceptual framework]] of other things that I have mentioned, and a whole set of teachings. So what does that whole set move towards, and how does this notion of eros - how is it supported by that other set, and how does it support that other whole conceptual framework? So really not about right or wrong or arguing with people, but it is important to say this is just one among many possible ways. The way I am going to define it in a minute is one among many possible ways. The way we are going to define it over this [[retreat]], actually, is one among many possible ways. But it is also a delineation that is based on, if you like, a [[Phenomenology|phenomenological]] approach, meaning just the observation of [[experience]] and what is actually happening in experience. But that observation is already informed and based on certain directions in practice to do with [[Insight|understandings]] of [[emptiness]], and also [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]] and notions of [[soulmaking]]. So phenomenological observation is always informed by a conceptual framework. But the definitions we are using are based on really what is observed in experience in that territory. ^1-4
###### 1-5
So not about right or wrong, that is the first thing, but what is it serving, and how can we define it in a way that serves our purposes? Second thing is a more general thing about definitions and [[delineations]] in general. It has to do with something that philosophers call the hermeneutic circle. [[Hermeneutics#Overview|Hermeneutics]] is a word that basically means interpretation. It comes out of - it emerged as a word in terms of the study of sacred texts and descriptions of what does it actually mean, this text; how should we interpret when the [[Buddha]] said this, or in some [[Tantra|tantric]] texts it says that, or actually the Bible or whatever. So it has to do with parts and wholes, in a way. If I am looking at a text, or if I have this concept of [[eros]], it is one part within a much larger whole. So this word that I want to interpret in the text, or the text itself is part of - the word is part of a much larger group of words that make up the text, and the text itself is part of a much larger probably group of texts or stream of tradition or historical context or whatever. I can not fully understand the part unless I understand the whole. ^1-5
###### 2-1
So in this case, we can not actually take [[eros]] on its own and sort of understand that without [[Insight|understanding]] the other parts of a bigger whole of what we are calling this integrated vision of practice, integrated [[conceptual framework]] or architecture of practice that involves [[imaginal]] practices, [[soulmaking]]. I can not really take it on its own, eros, separate from those, and hope to understand it. But similarly, the conundrum of the hermeneutic circle is I can not understand the whole until I understand the particular parts. So I certainly wo not understand the whole text unless I understand the individual words within it, and I wo not even understand this text unless I see and have a bigger understanding of the tradition and the group of texts that it involves. This applies, actually, to everything. It even applies to our understanding of [[mindfulness]]. Mindfulness, to understand or to move closer, if you like, to an understanding of what the [[Buddha]] meant, we actually need to understand the whole of [[Dharma|the path]] and the whole of his Dharma, because mindfulness is situated within that Dharma, and its meaning, and its directions, and what it draws on, and the assumptions and all of that has a place, has a context. I can not really understand mindfulness until I have understood the whole of the Dharma, if you like, and what the Buddha shaped with that and opened with that. ^2-1
###### 2-2
Similarly, I can not really understand the whole of the [[Dharma]] unless I understand the individual elements of it. It is the same here in relation to [[eros]]. Eros is, as I said, tied in with a whole other web of concepts, and to take it out on its own and try and define it is actually not really - strictly speaking - possible. It is still helpful, and that is what I am going to do as a start, but it is tied in with other notions, ideas, concepts, and experiences. Everything that I say so far, all these words that I have just sometimes thrown out without fully explaining, it will all get elaborated over the [[retreat]]. Because of this problem with the hermeneutic circle, what is called the hermeneutic circle, because of this contextualization and relationship and the place that something like eros takes within a larger set and framework of ideas and experiences, et cetera, it means that we are going to have to move back and forth between a sort of small vision, big vision, and tie things together. So really, we are going to elaborate what eros means over quite a long time and ask for your patience with that, but it is kind of necessary. That will give us a much richer, deeper, fuller [[Insight|understanding]] that is actually much more helpful. ^2-2
###### 2-3
[10:14] The third thing about definition, in relation to [[eros]] specifically, is that Eros classically is a god, a [[divinity]], and divinities are by their nature not fully fathomable, not fully capturable in concept. They have some kind of infinitude to them, and so they are not fully definable. That does not mean that we should not venture certain concepts. And I will explain this much more later, why a) we can not avoid [[Conceptual Framework|conceptuality]], and b) actually conceptuality is necessary and part of the erotic movement. An expanding - this is the thing, an expanding, not a limited or fixed or stuck conceptuality; that is where the rub comes. It is not that we just say, "Oh, it is divine, it is infinite, it is undefinable," and we just shrug and forget about it. Then we do not amplify that. It does not come alive to us as an area of interest. But we can use concepts. We do not hope to ever completely capture it and say, "That is it. That is my definition. Watertight, very neat, thank you very much." Maybe in some traditions actually Eros is a semi-divinity, a sort of demi-god, in between the divine and the not divine, if you like. And that may also allow us to be - part of the reason why we can be more conceptual, or at least approach part of it or begin to approach it through some conception. We will return to all this business about conceptuality. ^2-3
###### 2-4
But let us start - having said all that about caveats, and qualifications, and all that, and complications about definitions - let us start with a really simple definition, okay? Or a relatively simple definition. This is just to start, just to get us started, bearing in [[mind]] that we can not capture it completely, bearing in mind that it involves lots of other concepts, et cetera, and it is not right or wrong, all that. Let us start with a really relatively simple definition. I will say [[eros]] is a [[desire]]. It is a kind of desire. It is a wanting, but wanting what? It wants, let us say, more contact. It wants more contact, more connection, with what we could call its object, or whatever erotic object we are talking about. We are going to use that language a lot. Erotic object means what eros is in relationship to, or the beloved, if you like, if you want that more poetic language. ^2-4
###### 3-1
So [[eros]] wants more, let us say, contact and connection with the erotic object. Now, because these words, contact and especially connection have become so sort of used, they have almost lost their power. So I am going to elaborate this a little bit. It wants more contact and connection. It wants to touch the erotic object more. These words I am using really quite broadly. What does it mean to touch? Does touch just mean the skin touching something? Certainly it means that, but it means much more. What does it mean to touch? Think, think of the fullness of that word, and how we can touch things, what [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] of our being and our [[psyche]] can touch things. It wants to touch, it wants to touch more of the erotic object. It wants to know more. It wants to know the object more. It wants to know the beloved more. And again, that word know - think of the fullness of what that word means: I want to know you. I am really using the words quite broadly here. It wants to [[experience]] more of the beloved, more of the erotic object. So it has to do with experience, intimacy. Eros is a wanting to penetrate the erotic object more, to open more to the beloved, to open to more of the erotic object, to penetrate more of the erotic object, to penetrate more. ^3-1
###### 3-2
These words - penetrate, open, maybe know - these are also words with sexual connotations, right? That is deliberate. It is not limited to that. We are going to come back to these words in particular. But using these words broadly. [[Eros]] is the wanting of more contact, more connection, more touch, more knowing, more [[experience]], to experience more of, to have more intimacy, more penetration, more opening to the erotic object or beloved. Now, that erotic object could be anything - anything so-called outer or inner. Anything. The erotic object, the object of eros, can be anything. And notice also about this simple definition for now, notice that word more. I put a lot of emphasis on that word, more. I do not know the myth from the classical myth, but Eros always goes along with - I think he is another god called Pothos. Pothos is another Greek word. And Pothos is [[Infinity|the infinite]] [[desire]] or the desire for the infinite. So it is always - it is the more. This is the more. Pothos has something like it always wants to move on. When it is got something, it wants more, more, more. So I am going to say that that pothos is a part of eros. When we talk about eros, it implies and involves and has as an intrinsic element pothos, and that is the more. It wants more touching, more knowing of, more experience of, more penetration, more opening to. ^3-2
###### 3-3
So, you might be like, "Well, that is not a very interesting definition." It is quite a humble definition, in a way. It is really starting quite simple. And in some senses, it is quite a broad definition, and in others it is quite narrow. You might think, "That is a bit disappointing definition," or maybe not a big deal. But my contention, what I hope you will at some point be convinced by, is actually the [[beauty]] of this way of defining it, and that you will begin to see - slowly, hopefully more and more - the power of it as a way of thinking about [[eros]], that it has all kinds of implications and consequences that emerge from it, that are kind of wrapped up not so obviously but are intrinsic to it and create, if you like, the beauty and the fullness and the richness and the multidirectionality of what eros actually is and what it does. ^3-3
###### 3-4
[18:05] Okay. So again, notice again, [[eros]] is not - we are not defining it as - or rather we are saying it is not the same as [[sexuality]] or sexual attraction or sexual [[energy]]. It includes that in our definition. That is certainly part of it, and you can - it is wanting more touch, more penetration, more openness, to know, to be intimate, so sexuality is one dimension of that or one manifestation of that at a certain level and in a certain direction. We are not, also, equating it with Freud's pleasure principle, the seeking of pleasure and pleasant sensations, which would be akin to one of the [[Buddha]]'s lists of what [[craving]] or [[clinging]] involves. So that is certainly involved, pleasure is involved - I am going to come back to this - in eros, but it is not actually what eros is after. Nor are we equating it with what Freud would call the life instinct versus the [[death]] instinct, or even the life force - in other words, the sort of life energy - nor [[love]]. So the way we are using the word eros does not - we are not equating them with all these. There is a relationship of the way that we are using the word eros with each of those, but they are not equal. ^3-4
###### 3-5
In some instances, [[eros]] is the bigger concept - for instance, in relation to [[sexuality]]. In other instances of these other definitions, eros would be the smaller concept. I would say eros is a part or an element of life force, or, better, a certain direction or manifestation of life force. As beings, we have a certain amount of life force at any time, or just in our existence, and eros would be one directionality and one manifestation of the way that life force manifests. Eros is one kind of [[desire]]; [[craving]] would be another kind of desire; craving for [[Hindrances|sense pleasures]] would be another kind of desire. But also notice something else. In some traditions, ancient traditions, and it is continued to this very day - I think it came either from the Platonic teachings, I do not know enough about it, or from the Neoplatonic tradition. So for instance, there was a mystic and a sage and a philosopher with the wonderful name of Dionysius the Areopagite. Actually, this guy that I am talking about had the even more wonderful name of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, because, it seems, for very complex reasons, he was pretending to be the other guy, Dionysus, the guy who had lived a few hundred years before that. Anyway. This Dionysius the Areopagite, among other teachers, defines eros as really that force that moves towards [[Samadhi|unification]], towards union, towards melting in [[oneness]], et cetera. So we are not defining it that way. This is important. And this is quite common in some psychologies and some spiritual teachings these days. We are not defining it - there is a relationship between this movement towards unification, but actually it is more complex. ^3-5
###### 4-1
Going back to our definition, [[eros]] is this [[desire]], this wanting for more contact, more connection, more touching, more knowing, more experiencing, more intimacy, more penetrating and opening to the beloved or the erotic object. So there is a relationship with the movement towards unifying, but - and we are going to elaborate this; both of us will elaborate this a lot more - eros will always want more. It will always want more, more of this connecting, touching, et cetera, opening to, which means that either it will, if you like, resurrect a twoness - it will resurrect the beloved object after an [[experience]] of [[oneness]] or union - or it creates or discovers more of the other, other othernesses, other things to reach towards in the object; it complexifies it. I am going to explain this much more. Or it simply does not go towards union. It does not move towards dissolution, towards union, towards melting, towards a collapsing of the twoness into oneness. So either it does but it will re-instigate, it will create or discover - this is something we will come back to - other othernesses, or recreate a kind of more of the beloved other, so to speak, to move towards, or it will simply resist somehow that collapse to oneness, it will preserve the twoness, [[the self]] and the erotic object, the beloved. Much more about that later. But this is a really, really important point. ^4-1
###### 4-2
So how do we recognize [[eros]]? How do we recognize the presence of eros in our [[experience]], in our life, in our meditations, in our [[relationships]]? I remember teaching many years ago - well, a few years ago - and giving some instructions on mindstates, emphasizing the [[awareness]] of developing sensitivity to how the mindstate was sort of reflected in and affected the [[Embodiment|body]] and the experiences in the body, and also just the general texture of the [[mind]] space. My two co-teachers commented afterwards and said that they thought some people just would never be able to do that or couldn't do that, and a much better way of going about it was to say that you recognize the mindstate through the thoughts - the kind of thoughts you have tell you what mindstate you are in, so if you have angry thoughts you know you are angry, et cetera. ^4-2
###### 4-3
All I can say for now - and actually for the way that I would conceive of this whole set of teachings and the [[Dharma]] in general - is that as practitioners, we need to develop our sensitivity and the subtlety of our [[awareness]] to be able to notice mindstates. If we are calling [[eros]] a mindstate or state of being, to develop the sensitivity to that without relying on the clues and cues of thoughts. Seeing how the [[energy body]] is affected, developing the sensitivity to that, to the textures of [[mind]] and what we might call the space of mind, the subtle mental movements that are there even when there is no thought, or they are underneath or alongside thought. So I, in a way, stand by that in the sense that I can not really see how the kinds of things we are talking about and the capacity to work with them in practice would even be remotely possible without those kinds of sensitivities. We are talking about developing practice in a way that demands quite a lot, and one of the basic things it demands is a sensitivity to the energy body, and a more subtle sensitivity in general to the mind. ^4-3
###### 5-1
But this ties in to a point anyway that I have said before and will repeat again: when we talk about [[eros]], like everything, we are talking about a spectrum. So it can be incredibly intense and, in a way, quite gross and obvious, or really, really quite subtle. Somehow we want, if we are going to explore it and investigate it and include it as part of our reach of what the [[Dharma]] means and our practice means and our path means, then we are going to have to be sensitive and recognize its presence and be able to work with it across that whole realm of subtlety and intensity. That means that we can handle and work with and not get bowled over with really intense eros - and we will come back to that whole question about balance, et cetera - and also that we can recognize and work with it when it is really very subtle, and it is still recognizable, sensable, and fruitful. ^5-1
###### 5-2
Also you will notice kind of implicit in the definition and part of recognizing [[eros]] is that eros involves attraction. There is attraction in eros. It wants more, more x, y, z, as we said. So attraction is implicitly part, the force of attraction that one can recognize in oneself and feel and actually explore - it is attracted to what? But included in that, or because of that, or with that attraction, eros has this felt tension in it. So eros usually involves some degree of tension, often because of the more - it always wants more - and/or because, as I mentioned, the attraction towards the erotic object is not dissolved, or if it is dissolved it is only temporarily dissolved in union. There is an element in eros, if you like, that preserves the otherness, and therefore the tension of the two and the tension of the attraction. The attraction does not lead to [[oneness]], either at all or as a final resting place in which that oneness - there is no more tension of the [[desire]]. So always, to say it again, there is the preservation of otherness, or the creation of more otherness - more of this object, more [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] of this object and therefore more otherness, or the discovery, if you like, of more to the object and more to move into with this attraction, with the directionality of the desire. ^5-2
###### 5-3
[29:50] So you can already see, it is simple but it is already quite complex. We are going to go into this thing about twoness and [[oneness]] and preserving otherness and all that. We are going to go into that more, as I said. But recognizing [[eros]]. Again, eros often has a certain what we might call [[juiciness]] to it. Now, that is quite interesting, too. The word libido, which some people use interchangeably with eros, the word libido is related to the word lips, and the moisture of lips, the drippings of pleasure. I am taking this etymology both from James Hillman and also from [?] who wrote a book about the [[history]] of Western thought and certain concepts, and traces them through history. Libido is drippings of pleasure, juices, libation, our word libation, drink, the excitations of lust, the pouring of liquid as in libation, as I said. Deliquare is to make liquid, to make something a liquid or to melt. It is also related to the Latin word laetus which is moistness, or fatness, or fruitfulness - that is very key to our definition, fruitfulness - and gladness. And also related to the German lieben which is [[love]], as well as to the word liber in Latin, which means free. And the god Liber was a fertility god, a procreative figure. ^5-3
###### 5-4
It is also related to something you may have heard me say in other talks about the necessity to make all things liquid. The [[Alchemy|alchemical]] maxim, "Do not proceed until all things have been made liquid" - in other words, not reified. So [[eros]] and its connection with the word libido, all this is wrapped up. Actually, we will be using the word libido - when we even use it - as meaning more something like psychic [[energy]] in general, the energy of the [[psyche]]. But anyway, it is related. And [[juiciness]] seems to be a part of the erotic [[experience]], a part of the experience of eros. Part of that, part of the reason for juiciness is that - and this is something we are going to have to explain in more detail later - eros always invokes, stimulates, or involves, or is involved with, the [[imaginal]] and [[soulmaking]]. Eros always invokes, is involved with or involves, and stimulates the imaginal and the soulmaking. I will explain more about this later. That process of soulmaking and the imaginal is, in itself, rich, so eros brings more richness. This whole process of soulmaking is a rich process and a juicy process. ^5-4
###### 5-5
So attraction, tension, [[juiciness]]. The [[imaginal]] - I will come back to that - or [[image]] is part of [[eros]] or involved with eros; it is part of how we recognize it. All this implies a kind of dynamism. So there is the dynamism of the attraction toward the object. That is also recognizable as a feature of eros. There is this dynamism of attraction towards the erotic beloved. But there is also the dynamism of what I just referred to and I will elaborate much more as the [[retreat]] goes on, this dynamism of the stimulation of the [[soulmaking]] process, which is a dynamic process - it involves movement, expansion, [[Papanca|complication]], enrichment, widening, deepening of image, of what we might call [[psyche]], and also of [[Conceptual Framework|conceptuality]]. So there is a dynamism involved in eros that has to do with that dynamic. It is not always obvious at first. It is the dynamism of the attraction to the object that is more obvious. But actually it turns out that the object we are attracted to is more the complex of image, idea, eros itself. That becomes the object. Much more about this later. ^5-5
###### 6-1
But there, as I said, if we are talking about recognizing [[eros]], there is attraction, [[juiciness]], tension, dynamism. Arousal, arousal is also a part of the erotic [[experience]]. Now, I do not necessarily mean sexual arousal - although of course that is a part of it, can be - or even perhaps measurable or observable psychophysical arousal that a person might measure with electrodes or something or other (may or may not, I do not know). But really the arousal involved with eros is an arousal of interest. So we talk about the spark, as well. There is an arousal of interest. We are really interested in this beloved. Something engages us, compelling in the best sense of the word. It is really captivating, again in the best sense of the word. The interest is aroused. And also the [[energy body]] is aroused, by which I mean the energy body is energized, it will feel energized; it will feel open; and it will probably feel aligned. I have talked about this on past [[Retreat|retreats]] when we talked about the energy body, working in [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]]. But it is also a feature of when there is eros, the energy body is also aroused. Now, that arousal, again, can be very intense, very, very intense, or really quite subtle. And it may be relatively unagitated; there is quite a peaceful feeling with it, often - not always, but often. ^6-1
###### 6-2
There is also an aspect which I think I will leave this to later when we have explained more what I mean by this [[soulmaking dynamic]], eros-psyche-logos, but I will just mention it now, of autoeroticism. What becomes for us an erotic object also involves ourselves and involves our [[eros]], so the eros itself becomes erotically beautiful to us, our own eros and our selves also. What I am [[Passion|calling]] autoeroticism, I will come back to that, hopefully in the next talk. ^6-2
###### 6-3
Now, let us invent another slight delineation here in relation to some of what we just said. I am going to make up a delineation between two words: delight and bliss. Again, no at all claim that this would be a correct dictionary definition or other right definition or anything like that. Let us say, let us use the term delight, and say that [[eros]] usually is accompanied by or involves delight. Delight is involved with erotic [[experience]]. By delight, I mean a sense of fullness, of richness, of aliveness, of interest as we just said. The delight of [[soulmaking]], of this enriching process, this expanding process that soulmaking is. We can say axiomatically the [[soul]] loves soulmaking. It is almost a circular definition of the soul. What is the soul? The soul is what loves soulmaking. It loves this dynamic, this process of soulmaking, of [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos]] and their mutual fertilization, expansion, deepening, enriching, widening, so that soulmaking is intrinsically delightful, if you like. And eros, because it goes with all that, it is almost always got a sense of delight with it. So you could say that is part of [[juiciness]], but let us just say that is specific to the soulmaking quality. ^6-3
###### 6-4
Now, [[eros]] may involve bliss. Again, I am just making up a definition here, just for our purposes, and defining bliss as an [[experience]] of the [[energy body]] of great [[pleasantness]] in the energy body, of [[Piti|rapture]] or [[Happiness|joy]] in the energy body, and that kind of openness, et cetera, sometimes again very intense, sometimes much more subtle. But that energy body experience of bliss, I would say, accompanies any lightening or unfabricating, to whatever degree, of [[the self]]-sense, up to a certain point, at least. When we get really deep unfabricating, I am not sure you can really use the word bliss at all, when you get to the deeper [[jhanas]], et cetera. So you can have a bliss without eros, or without delight, or without [[soulmaking]]. For example - and I will come back to this, too - the bliss of the first jhƒÅna or the third jhƒÅna may or may not be soulmaking. In itself, in some ways, it is not, for reasons I will explain. It is just bliss without eros and without soulmaking delight, the delight of soulmaking. And of course sometimes you can have a delight in soulmaking without bliss, quite often, without that sort of strong feeling in the energy body. But basically eros usually involves delight or is accompanied by delight, and it may involve bliss. ^6-4
###### 7-1
[40:35] Okay, so, recognizing [[eros]]. Again, just to run through those. Big spectrum of intensity and subtlety. It involves attraction, that is implicit in it. It includes some kind of felt tension; [[juiciness]] certainly, a richness of [[experience]]; dynamism of different kinds, arousal of interest, of the [[energy body]]; autoeroticism, which I will come back to; delight usually accompanies it; and it may involve bliss, this [[pleasantness]], rapturous or joyful, peaceful, beautiful [[feelings]] in the energy body, in the experience of the energy body. So these are some of the - this is a start into defining eros in a very simple way with some caveats, and actually we are going to see what that does and expand it, enrich the very definition or the delineation of eros and really fill it out over the [[retreat]], put it in relationship to other concepts. But these are some of the elements of recognizing the experience. ^7-1
###### 7-2
So you already see in some of what we are talking about, it is hard to go too far into this without bringing in other elements or part of this web or architecture of ideas and experiences and [[delineations]] that we are going to try to unfold as part of this wider, more integrated, more far-reaching [[conceptual framework]] or path. And so that is what we are going to begin to do, start to draw it together, draw in some of these ideas and involve them in each other. Okay? ^7-2
