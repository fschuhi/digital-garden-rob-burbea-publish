###### 1-1
I remember many years ago one of my [[music]] teachers saying that I think it was [[Dwight Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]] - and I could have that wrong, but someone like that; and apologies to him and his memory if this is wrong; it actually does not matter who it was for the point of what I am relating - but General Eisenhower or someone said, proclaimed, "I only recognise two pieces of music: one is Yankee Doodle Dandy and the other is not". And so, I do not quite know the context or even what he was getting at when he said that and whether it is relevant that the tune he did recognise was, you know, a patriotic nationalistic militaristic thing or not. But imagine someone or consider someone who has that kind of degree or extent of tone-deafness in relation to music. They are really quite unreceptive to music, and really quite unperceptive. So what they are perceiving or what they are getting from it is, you know, almost for some people would be staggeringly little. ^1-1
###### 1-2
Now if such a person were to insist that there is just one tune, Yankee Doodle Dandy, and the rest of it was just random noise, for instance, or the rest of it was all actually the same thing or something to that effect, what would you say to such a person if they absolutely insist that their [[perception]] there is reflective of reality? And probably in his case he is surrounded from childhood with people who seem to be getting something from [[music]] and school teachers etc. who hopefully kindly explain to him that, you know, he is missing something there etc. But what if only relatively few people, let us say, in the society got music, what would happen then? So there were only relatively few people who somehow music was very meaningful to them, full of all kinds of [[relationships]] that they could hear between sounds and themes and modulations of key or, you know, pitches and harmonies and rhythms and textures. And they perceived a great deal of nuance of structure and shading and evolution and all that, and it had a huge effect on them, on their heart, on their [[psyche]], on the body, on the [[soul]], the [[meaningfulness]]. ^1-2
###### 1-3
Imagine if there were just a few people like that in a society where everyone else was more like [[Dwight Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]]. Might it not be then that they were considered somehow a bit perhaps even pathological, maybe crazy, maybe "oh they are just pretending, they are imagining something." And the claim of "that is not real, what they are perceiving there and what they feel there, seeing these [[relationships]], these meanings etc,. it is not real." For me this is quite an interesting reflection. It is like, is [[music]] and those relationships and the relationships between essentially just sounds, pitches, timbres, all that, are they real or not real? It is an interesting question. Is music - and I do not just mean the fact that here is a pitch, a frequency of so many Hertz, and this rhythm is twice the rapidity of this rhythm, or something like that; I mean the whole [[Gestalt Psychology|gestalt]] of it including its sense of [[meaningfulness]] and [[beauty]] and [[soul]] and all that - is that real or not real? Is that even the right question? Would we better ask, is it important? ^1-3
###### 1-4
Now for some people clearly it is not important and for others it is extremely important, [[music]], those [[relationships]], the [[meaningfulness]] there, the [[Soul|soulfulness]], the heartfulness, the effects on the body, moving into dance, or just touching the [[psyche]] to the core, stimulating. That is not a question of reality or not reality. It is important. And another question, rather than is it real or not real, is is it [[soulmaking]]? Is it soulmaking? So these questions of what is important and what is soulmaking rather than what is real or not real, are more, if you like, important or relevant questions for certain areas of our [[experience]] - actually of quite a lot in life. ^1-4
###### 1-5
And it is also interesting to note - and I know this as someone who was a musician and studied [[music]] etc. - that the sensitivity to music, the perceptivity, the [[receptivity]], the [[Insight|understanding]] and the noticing and the picking up of all kinds of nuances of [[relationships]] etc. between what is at one level just a sound, different kinds of sound, that is developable. So the perceptivity, the capacity of [[perception]], the capacity of the subtleties, the nuance, the capacity of understanding concepts there and relationships, and even the degree of affect - all this is developable, is trainable. What if we transfer that whole set of analogies there around music and receptivity, perceptivity, capacity of perception and conception in relation to music and [[Soul|soulfulness]] and importance, and transfer that to the perception of nature and the perception of others in our lives, or things, or the [[Cosmology|cosmos]]? ^1-5
###### 2-1
Again just as you can reduce [[music]] to just sort of the physics of sound - this pitch, that frequency, this timber with this kind of wave on the oscilloscope or whatever, all that - we are missing something that is more important to us, whose [[perception]] we can deepen and deepen and open and refine and enrich etc. Maybe the same with nature, maybe the same with the perception of others, the [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]] that we are talking about, when there is an erotic relationship with music, with art, with nature, with another, with others, with a thing, an object, with the [[Cosmology|cosmos]]. So the whole real/not real question is a little misguided there, and yet you can see just how much what is acceptable or the dominant view within a culture can tend to really whole sway and gain an authority just because it is what most people are able to perceive or it is not what most people are able to perceive. ^2-1
###### 2-2
Then again you get the converse as well in [[history]], of the authority of those who claim to perceive something and the reality of what they perceive over those that do not. And oftentimes this is what you get. Apart from the political issues there you get a clash of realisms, a clash of essentially fundamentalisms: this is true, all reality is based on this, or this is real. Someone describes something, a mystical [[perception]] or a spiritual perception, [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]]: that is rubbish, it does not exist. And the other person says they do exist, these stones really are talking to me, this whatever it is. And both are kind of assuming - even if they are not aware of it - they are drawing on, basing on their arguments, if you like, an assumption of some kind of objective independently existing reality, and "it does not exist like that" or "it does exist like that." So that is all that reality kind of means. And people get very - it is a charged issue. I mean, certainly in certain circles it is a charged issue. So some people who oppose a kind of any importance or place given to imaginal perception, mystical perception, spiritual perception etc., there is a kind of secular crusade that some people try and wage. And probably vice versa in history etc., or at present. ^2-2
###### 2-3
So someone might try and say something like "science shows that these things do not exist", but actually this person has not understood science and the whole scientific project. Does it show that these things do not exist? What is the range of science, what science even purports or is qualified or equipped to investigate? And what is the range of the [[scientific method]]? So the very structure of the scientific method is to leave out deliberately a whole slew of aspects of our being because that is not what we are doing; we are paring that away. Something similar goes on with [[mindfulness]], as well. One is amputating, chopping off a whole range of other [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] of our being, of our [[experience]], of our [[Ways of Looking|ways of knowing]] etc. So a person who says something like that would do well, I think, to investigate a little bit of philosophy of science over the centuries and especially more recently, and to question even what science says about basic realities. For example, the electron, subatomic particle - no one's ever seen an electron. The reality given to an electron is not the reality of a little tiny billiard ball that is a model of it. And even that model of it is not really the model of modern quantum mechanics and science. It has no where, no when, specifically, objectively, independently existing. The electron is no place, and it does not occur any time. It has no particular velocity or mass etc. It is not really even a thing, as Niels Bohr said. Does it even have existence? So do not assume that what you learned in high school and what you kind of surmised about science about what it proves or what it asserts is actually the reality of what someone at the frontiers of science - let us say a particle physicist etc. - who is really at the edge and actually doing creative research there, would actually hold. ^2-3
###### 3-1
And what, anyway, is the difference between the [[scientific method]] - "I will deliberately put aside [[feelings]], I will deliberately put aside imagination, I will deliberately put aside even ethical values, aesthetic values. That is the ideal of the scientific method. And it is a method. It is a methodology. Its not a fact about reality. So what started as a scientific methodology in the [[scientific revolution]] and with the western [[Awakening|enlightenment]] actually became over several hundred years entrenched as an unquestioned fact about reality and existence. Strictly speaking, it is a methodology. It is one way of knowing. Someone a little bit more sophisticated, say who is keen to not give much place to [[Imaginal|imaginal perceptions]], either intrapsychically or in and of the world, mystical states of [[consciousness]] etc., would say perhaps something like, would know that a notion of truth is no longer philosophically respectable, and if you go using words like truth etc., it tends to raise eyebrows in certain circles, of disapproval and questioning, supercilious questioning. Which is fine. ^3-1
###### 3-2
But then oftentimes they avoid that word, perhaps deliberately, and perhaps make a noise about avoiding that word, but underneath they are assuming some kind of basic existential reality or 'facticity' to borrow a fancy fashionable word from modern philosophy of our situation. "This is our situation. We live in a meaningless, material universe of which we are emergent. Our [[consciousness]] and our being and our complexity over the aeons of evolution is amazing, evolution out of matter and consciousness is an epiphenomenon. Essentially the world is material. There are no other [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] really. And it is finite. We are finite. We are faced by our [[death]] and the extinction of all that," and that "you are trying to pump up the [[imaginal]] or mystical [[perception]] of things that happen in [[meditation]] and all that, or ideas about ultimate transcendent - something transcendent that we can open to beyond the senses etc., and all that beyond [[Materialism|materiality]], all that. This is just your attempt at a kind of consolation because you can not handle the fact, the truth of our existential situation. "Of course they do not use the word truth. They might use the word facticity or something. Or just the accusation of consolation-seeking already assumes that this is the truth: the existential fact is what you seek consolation with respect to. ^3-2
###### 3-3
So it might not use the language of truth. Might hide it. But it is functioning there. And there is the clash of [[realism]] so often in these kind of conversations. And a person who is drawn to investigating, and opening up, and exploring the [[imaginal]] and mystical states of [[consciousness]] and [[perception]], and questioning the whole assumptions about reality etc. that are so pervasive in our modernist and materialist and physicalist culture, can very easily embark on that kind of investigation with all their enthusiasm and openness and very easily be shaken into doubt or, if you like, pressed in to doubt just because of the pervasiveness of the dominant view [[Dominant Culture|in our culture]]. Or they might hear a talk or read a book by someone who is presenting the case for erasing and eradicating mystical perceptions and mystical notions and any place for the imaginal - in a talk, or in a book; could be in a secular context; could be in a secular [[Dharma|Dhamma]] context; could be here at [[Gaia House]]; could be wherever. And it is very easy now to be for a person to be buffeted this way and that by all the opinions flying around this way and that in the community, whether it is a smaller community or the larger community or the culture. So a person wanting to explore and having experiences and being really touched by certain experiences, imaginal openings and perceptions or meditative openings and experiences etc., all different kinds experiences which potentially can be really fertilising and fertile as seeds in the [[psyche]], in the consciousness, in the life, can very easily, because of all these different opinions, because of what is dominant in the culture, and because of a lot of the aggression that often goes with that - which itself is very interesting; why is there so much aggression bound up with this question? ^3-3
###### 3-4
But such a person, such a meditator, or a yogi, a person exploring this way, can then be as I said assailed by doubt, even paralysed. Had these experiences, been touched by them, feel drawn to them, want to open to them; something happens, I hear so and so give a talk, or I read a few pages of a book or whatever it is, and somehow it goes into a kind of freeze. Something gets paralysed. Or they just dismiss, or they are ashamed, or they keep it to themselves, and then it withers or something. And especially when what they read or hear is quite aggressive. And the person who is being dismissive and perhaps being aggressive or polemical in their crusade against these kind of openings of [[perception]], openings of [[ways of looking]] etc., does not need to even say anything particularly brilliant or radically incisive or particularly even new as an idea or an [[insight]]. Oftentimes all they need to do is just slowly and clearly, and take their time, just basically essentially repeat the dominant unquestioned view of the culture to which we have all been exposed over years [[Dominant Culture|in our culture]]; even if you grew up in a religious setting you are still exposed to what I call the dominant view of [[modernism]], of [[physicalism]] etc., of meaninglessness and all that, of what the reality of our existential situation is. ^3-4
###### 4-1
So a person can grow up buffeted by different views - oftentimes maybe that characterises our society - but this physicalist - what should we call it - flat world view of [[Modernism|secular modernism]] is something we have all been kind of subject to pervasively, and from all different sides, and loudly and implicitly. So a lot of these messages are really not even that obvious for years. So all the person has to do is just slowly and clearly repeat what you have already heard, what some part of you already understands and knows, without actually making explicit the assumptions underneath that and the historical context to that etc. In a way the power of that argument comes from the fact that it is a repetition, and it is a hearing of what one has already heard before and knows and been indoctrinated with, and "empowered from the solidarity", to borrow a phrase from [[Richard Rorty]] - just the fact that so many people either buy into it completely or buy into it at least partially in this kind of cognitive dissonance between that and their more spiritual beliefs or whatever. ^4-1
###### 4-2
So because it is a repetition of what you have already been saturated in, and because everyone else seem to agree, it makes that position actually quite easy. I do not have to say anything or write anything particularly incisive or new or whatever. Or often what happens is a kind of straw man gets set up as an opposition who is an easy target - someone like an Islamic fundamentalist terrorist or someone like that, or some of the corruption in the papacy, or someone who has clearly ridiculously holding on to something out of a desperate [[fear]] of their perceived existentialist situation and wanting consolation etc. It is a straw man. It is an easy target. Why am I saying all this? Jst to make the point again that, you know, a grasp of - and I use that word carefully, a grasp of - a rootedness in a carefully thought out, structured, supportive and generative [[conceptual framework]], one that is to some degree reliable and robust and sophisticated and well-conceived enough; a grasp of that, a rootedness in that, a consideration of that and - what is the word - an internalisation even of that, an active use of that in navigation, in orientation, will provide stability in that kind of culture which is the culture we are in now, buffeted by different opinions, often quite aggressive etc,. being exposed to certain points of view incredibly pervasive, literally inundated by that view so that we do not even consider it a [[dogma]] because it is so pervasive - it is like a fish not recognising water, the water that it is swimming in. ^4-2
###### 4-3
But a grasp of, a rootedness in, a use of, an implementation of, an incorporation of a careful, supportive and generative [[conceptual framework]] brings, allows, a degree of stability, a degree of clarity, orientation. It gives a kind of foundation, as I think I said already, and actually will open up experiences further. So those experiences that are potentially fertilising as seeds can actually be that; they can actually fertilise the [[psyche]], the mind, the heart, the being, the body, all of that, for the [[soul]] that wants soulfulness, that wants [[soulmaking]]. And admittedly - and I will come back to this - we want that. Human beings seem to want that to different degrees. ^4-3
###### 4-4
So this is partly why a [[conceptual framework]] is really important, the entertaining of concepts and conceptual frameworks, deliberately, consciously, rigorously even. So we have said part of a conceptual framework that I would say is needed, a part of what must be included, is this whole unpacking, if you like, or explanation of the process of [[soulmaking]]. So based on, as I said, the [[Phenomenology|phenomenologically]] noticing "oh yeah" and deliberately delineating different kinds of movement of [[desire]], and so drawing out this distinction of [[eros]] and what is involved with that and where it goes, just from observation of what is involved for us, for the [[psyche]], for the [[citta]], as human beings in our life, and then exploring and explaining the dynamics of that soulmaking process, [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros psyche logos]], in its expansion, because of the pothos that we have talked about. Some way or another, part of the conceptual framework needs to kind of draw that out and give it a kind of conceptual grounding and structuring that is fertile. ^4-4
###### 5-1
And another aspect of the [[conceptual framework]] needs to be this nonseparation of the [[citta]] - which includes the [[soul]], what we are calling soul - [[Nondualism|non-separation]] of the mind-heart-soul-[[consciousness]], citta let us call it, nonseparation of the citta and whatever we sense of reality or whatever reality is. There is a nonseparation of citta and reality. And implied in that, or included with that, is the [[Emptiness|emptiness of all things]] and the whole notion of [[ways of looking]]. So the way of looking is an aspect or a mode of being of the citta, if you like, at any time. Al that - this nonseparation of citta and (quote) "reality", and the emptiness of all things, and the notion of diversity of ways of looking that are available to us - all that needs to be an aspect, an element woven in to the conceptual framework, which we said already. So that [[mindfulness]] is not and does not expose "reality" as it is, "things as they are". Does not expose "what is". Mindfulness does not bring us in to an encounter with something called life as someone put it "exorcised of the tumour of [[metaphysics]]". Uh-uh. Mindfulness is just one way of looking, wrapped up with a certain conceptual - well, actually quite a lot of concepts wrapped up in mindfulness, in the [[experience]] even of [[Attention|bare attention]]. It is one way of knowing. Great, fantastic, wonderful. It is one way of knowing. Probably it is more than that; really implicit in what the [[Buddha]] meant by mindfulness is already a range of ways of knowing. ^5-1
###### 5-2
But what we want, what we need, what the [[conceptual framework]] needs is to open - open the [[ways of looking]] with this different, more sophisticated idea of reality and the nonseparation of the [[citta]] (including the [[soul]]) and reality, the [[Emptiness|emptiness of all things]], and the ways of looking, all kind of implicit together in that. So an idea that I already mentioned, an idea like participation - this is a concept; it is also a [[perception]] that I can have. It is an [[experience]]. If you like, it is an [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]]. But where does imaginal perception shade into what we would not consider imaginal perception, we would just consider perception? But an idea like participation - for instance that this mind, my mind in its depths, is, if you like, rooted in or participates in the mind of the [[Cosmology|cosmos]]; not that it is just one with, but it participates in the mind of the cosmos, it expresses the mind of the cosmos, the divine mind, or that my imaginal faculty, the [[Image|images]] that come to me, the images I perceive, either intra-psychically or of the world, these too are the imagination of the divine or the [[Buddha]] Nature or whatever. So I participate in the Buddha Nature through my imaginal perception. Or again the [[eros]] that I feel, and all that whole range and all the directions of my eros is - we said this a few times - I have the sense that I am participating in the divine eros, in the eros of the Buddha with his [[Dakini|consort]], the consort with the Buddha. However we frame it there is some sense of this, of what I experience at one level as mine, is in another level mirroring, echoing, rooted in, originating in, and participating in the divine eros, the divine imaginal faculty, the divine imagination, the divine mind. ^5-2
###### 5-3
So that idea of participation or the set of ideas that we might call participation is an idea or set of ideas that actually supports and stimulates [[soulmaking]]. It brings more [[eros]], more [[psyche]], more [[image]], gives [[imaginal]] dimension, opens imaginal dimension, and a stretching and a complicating of the [[logos]], of the idea, so we get ideas that actually support and fertilise the soulmaking process. And therefore, it is a valuable idea. Why? Because it stimulates soulmaking. It supports and stimulates and gives more [[dimensionality]] etc. to the soulmaking movement and dynamic; therefore it is valuable and therefore it is valid. It is valid because it is valuable. Those words are actually related etymologically. It is valid because it is valuable and its value is that it stimulates what the [[soul]] loves, soulmaking. It stimulates that [[beauty]], that richness, that opening, that fertility, that creativity, that discovery, all of that, and the multidimensionality of that. ^5-3
###### 6-1
It also includes, this idea of participation - which this set of ideas called participation, it is part of a larger set of ideas which forms our [[conceptual framework]] or may be part of our conceptual framework - but participation as a set of ideas also includes the [[Insight|understanding]] that we are not dealing with anything that has an independent existence. So we participate in [[perception]]. Ee participate in the world that is perceived, in the very perception of it. We participate in the [[divinity]]. We participate in actually anything. Intrinsic to the very idea of participation is the realisation that things are empty, that there are [[ways of looking]], that our ways of looking are actually participatory. So what is seen, the way it appears, and the way of looking - there is no independent existence implied in that. ^6-1
###### 6-2
So if I say, "This idea of participation in the divine, are you saying that is ultimately true?" First of all, it is not necessary to the [[soulmaking]] that we believe it is ultimately true. A lot of people - sometimes this is very hard for people to understand. And I think it is intrinsic to a certain depth of soulmaking, because we realise [[image]] as image, we can actually also realise, if you like, idea as idea. I do not need to [say] "this is ultimately true!" in order for something to have its power, its efficacy, its capability and potency to open and to seed and fertilise our [[experience]], our [[perception]], our [[Insight|understanding]], our heart, our [[soul]], our minds, all of that, and our lives. Now actually if you go into this whole question of the whole meaning or exploration of participation, the very question "is it ultimately true?" crumbles because of what the idea is in itself. If we turn it the other way around, actually to claim the independent existence, the separate existence, separate from the [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]], independent of the way of looking - so not just talking about "yeah, you know, everything is physically connected to everything else"; independent of the way of looking, independent of the [[citta]], if you like, separate from the citta - to claim anything as independent in that way from the way of looking, separate from the citta, is actually I would say definitely not true. Any attempt at doing that so far in the [[history]] of humanity has been pretty seriously questioned and what one finds is it is actually very hard to construct a coherent [[conceptual framework]] on a ground of solidity, on a ground of independent existence, of something that is claimed to be independently existent. ^6-2
###### 6-3
The attempt, for example, in physics to derive everything from the basic building blocks of matter just comes round again, or so far has just come round again, to question the reality of those, the independent reality, independent of the [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]], of those basic building blocks. We can not find them as independently existing things, independent of the way of looking. And Nagarjuna showed this even relative to Buddhist atomism. Brilliant critique exposing the impossibility of constructing a coherent [[conceptual framework]] on realist grounds. And again in modern western philosophy in recent years, so from different directions. It is almost like to have a grounding in a conceptual framework that is solid - in terms of it gives a foundation, it has the effect of solidity - our ground actually needs to be not solid. You understand? I can not get away with claiming the independent separate existence of anything, claiming that that is a truth, that anything exists independent, separate from the way of looking. ^6-3
###### 6-4
And then this idea set of ideas, what we are calling participation, it also intrinsically implies that this observation or acknowledgment that the [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] both discovers and at the same time you could say grants [[Divinity|sacredness]] to something or other - I do not just discover it; we grant it. The way of looking grants it, or, if you like, we create it - whether it is an [[image]] or [[eros]] or whatever. That whole admission and observation is not a problem within the idea of participation. So to me there is a more sophisticated [[ontology]], and [[epistemology]], and [[cosmology]] in fact - [[metaphysics]], if you like - wrapped up in something like the idea of participation, which can sound at first like just abstract metaphysics with no grounding in anything real at all. So we go in to these things and actually really question, dare to question. ^6-4
###### 6-5
So there is a kind of pragmatism here, which again is quite a popular word in modern philosophy that essentially states, well, you can kind of believe what works for you. There is a pragmatism of approach and of [[Conceptual Framework|conceptuality]] here, but it is one that actually opens possibilities, possible new [[ways of looking]], or the possibility of new ways of looking, and actually implements them, opens orientations, opens experiences, opens the living and opens the field of life for us, the field of our existence, the sense of existence, in ways that we actually move through. Sometimes what you get is a sort of what is called pragmatist philosophy, but all it does is, as I said before, is revert almost by default back to whatever was the default concept or ideation of [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], [[cosmology]]. Basically the default hidden [[metaphysics]] there. So can we have something that is pragmatic, meaning it is really practical, it is an idea or a set of ideas that is really actually practical, we actually live that opens opens a [[perception]], opens up [[experience]], opens up ideation, opens the heart, and all that, the [[soul]]. ^6-5
###### 7-1
I would say what is needed is some kind of [[conceptual framework]] some set of connected ideas that supports an ongoingness, a potential ongoingness of exploration, inquiry. It supports the opening of frontiers, creativity and discovery in all domains and in all aspects of our being, and even those domains and those aspects of being can also also get opened up and increased. In other words, we discover domains, we discover aspects of being, or we create them, or both. They are opened for us where before we had no sense that there was even that domain of being and that aspect of our existence. You understand? Some conceptual frameworks, some set of connected ideas that would support this fecundity of exploration, expansion, opening, this [[infinity]] of domains and [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] and aspects of being, of existence - not just the intellect, certainly not; not just the heart, not just the body; you know, the artistic, all of this, the [[soul]]. "Soul? What do you mean, soul?" It is a domain of the being. The way these open up, like what the body can be, what the heart can be, what the intellect can be - in other words, how it can be conceived, not just the range of experiences there. ^7-1
###### 7-2
And so opening up also with all that a kind of potential infinitude of interpretations. Back to this [[Hermeneutics#Overview|hermeneutics]], that existence, life, world, [[Cosmology|cosmos]], being, humanity, body, all of this, [[Materialism|materiality]] - there is an infinitude of potential interpretations there. It is not [[Constriction|constrained]]. It is not constricted. Through the participation itself, creating/discovering interpretations - that is, if you like, the nature of existence, the nature of the cosmos. It is not limited. Infinitude of interpretations, the garden of infinite interpretations, the orchard of infinite interpretation. Infinite interpretations does not mean that any interpretation goes or that any interpretation is just as good as any other one. So I do not know if you know your mathematics of [[infinity]]; there is different kinds of infinity. So you can still have infinite interpretations, you can explore infinite interpretations theoretically at least, and still at the same time not explore a whole other infinite set. It is the nature of infinity. In other words - I do not want to labour this but - there are infinite even numbers and there are infinite odd numbers, so you can have infinite [[soulmaking]] interpretations, helpful interpretations and infinite unhelpful interpretations. ^7-2
###### 7-3
But to my way of thinking at the moment certainly, only that kind of [[conceptual framework]] would be philosophically viable and kind of legitimate or defendable, but more importantly only that kind of conceptual framework can satisfy [[soul]]. Only that kind of conceptual framework that is that fertile, that supports that ongoing expansion, [[Papanca|complication]], dimensionalising, etc., creativity/discovery, interpretation - only that kind of conceptual framework can support that. Only a conceptual framework that can support that will satisfy soul. ^7-3
###### 7-4
What if actually we play with the idea of placing [[soulmaking]], this movement of [[eros]] to stimulate the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]], expansion, [[Papanca|complication]], widening, deepening, enrichment, all of that, what if that soulmaking - actually we take that as a kind of a conception that can form a base for other explanations of all kinds of things? In other words, we take soulmaking as something kind of basic, kind of basic, just simply saying the [[soul]] wants (it has erotic [[desire]] for, in other words) soulmaking. It wants soulmaking. It wants expansion of soulmaking, the growth of soulmaking, the movement of soulmaking in all directions and domains, potentially infinitely - eventually. In other words there is a movement in time here; there is a becoming. So it may happen in fits and starts, or with blocks and then explosions and walls crumbling, or just gradual expansion or whatever. Which is something basic. It sounds really simple. The soul wants, has an erotic desire for, the expansion of soulmaking in all directions and domains eventually, or eventually in all directions and domains. ^7-4
###### 8-1
So that, you know, the [[soulmaking]] in regard to [[the self]], in regard to the beloved other or others, in regard to the world, becomes or is potentially equalised. Because the [[soul]] wants that soulmaking expansion in all directions and domains, this is its natural organic movement. So as [[imaginal]] and erotic objects, the other, the self, and the world are kind of equalised, balanced. They are all filled out. That the soulmaking movement is happening in all those directions. But also in the domains and the directions of body, heart, mind etc.. All these are expanded too, or the soul wants all these to be expanded: what the body is, how it can be perceived, what it means, what it can do, what it can feel, what it can sense, its [[Ways of Looking|ways of knowing]] - the heart, the mind, all of this. Not that one is blocked or stuck or cramped; that would be a blocking, a stopping, a cramping of the whole [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros psyche logos]] process, the whole soulmaking movement as we talked about earlier. ^8-1
###### 8-2
And so there are problems when one of these directions or domains or aspects of being, of existence, when one is blocked as an avenue of [[soulmaking]] or there is a stuckness there or it is cramped, something or other, the [[logos]] or the [[image]] or whatever is rigidified. That is when problems happen. Or there is an imbalance because one side is blocked, one direction is blocked, one aspect or domain is blocked. For example, [[the self]] is not equal - either there is not the inclusion of the self as being filled out by the [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]]; or there is a preoccupation with the self and then not filling out and not attending to the other as imaginal object, erotic object; or the world is not included. What happens to our relationship with nature when we lose the [[eros]] and the sense of [[dimensionality]] of the natural world? What happens when we objectify another? In other words, when they lose that dimensionality, that we lose the eros there. Maybe there is still [[metta]]. We talked about this before. But somehow I have objectified them. What happens? ^8-2
###### 8-3
As I said, what happens, for example, if our notion of flesh or [[Materialism|materiality]] or the body, that [[soulmaking]] erotic involvement with flesh, with body, is not allowed in some way or another? So that actually our sense and our concept and our [[perception]] of flesh and body is stuck at one level, maybe of one-[[dimensionality]], maybe of whatever it is. "It is this," "it is good for that," "it is not good for this,"" it is this or that." And to me this is a really interesting exploration, just to play with the idea or the notion, or entertain and experiment a little bit with placing soulmaking as a really fundamental or a kind of fundamental idea or movement in the whole of our way of thinking about psychology and [[spirituality]] and path and all that. So for instance it is quite interesting for me to think about, to reconsider, human developmental psychology - I wo not go into this a lot, I will just mention something just as a start in case someone at some point wants to pick this up. ^8-3
###### 8-4
Freud regarded pleasure seeking as the fundamental drive of the [[Personhood|human being]], and that is, if you like, that is what [[eros]] meant to him. And problems arose when there was a conflict between those drives for pleasure, often sexual, and gratification of [[Hindrances|sense pleasure]] were blocked or inhibited by or needed to be inhibited by culture and society and parenting and what not. So there was a whole developmental psychology that actually placed what he called eros, which is the pleasure seeking, at the fundament. Half a century or so later W.R.D. Fairbairn, a Scottish psychoanalyst in the Freudian lineage, loosely speaking, in what is called the British object relations school. He actually said the fundamental movement is object seeking. His word for that is libido rather than eros. And this is what the infant, the baby, seeks - an object, the other. And really what is fundamental, the fundamental drive, is to connect with others. So not, as Freud says, sense-pleasure, gratification of sense-pleasures, or the reduction of the tension in the drives towards sense-pleasure etc...  Fairbairn proposed this what he was [[Passion|calling]] libidinal drive, this connecting with others. That was the primary thing. And then there was an anti-libidinal - I am going to come back to this later on in the [[retreat]] - anti-libidinal drive that got kind of constellated there which was to protect one from the disappointment or [[pain]] of rejection by the object that we sought or the unavailability of that object. So these can get internalised as well - the object and the libidinal drives etc. in his theory, but what is fundamental is the connection with others. ^8-4

Nowadays it is quite popular to consider, oh, you know, in the womb there was a state of [[oneness]] and wholeness, non-differentiation from the mother in that environment, sort of oceanic state of oneness & bliss & [[Nondualism|non-separation]], and then at [[birth]] there is the trauma of the separation into differentiated being in the world and the trauma of separation from the oneness, which is a great shock to the system. And the whole production of [[the self]]-sense, the construction of the self-sense, is really a force for coherence, for delimitation - "I stop here" - for boundaries whose function is to protect against, if you like, a dissolution into oneness. You are actually creating boundaries because the memory of oneness is full of this sense of trauma at the birth separation. And then for others, for instance the Kohut ego psychology is really - in developmental psychology what it sets out to achieve is exactly this well-boundaried self. A kind of coherent, well-boundaried self, that is the fundamental achievement of psychological health and maturity. ^9-1
###### 9-2
So there is lots of - and there is more. But it is interesting to me, like, what if we conceived of [[eros]] as we have been speaking about it, and [[soulmaking]] as the fundamental drive, not pleasure seeking? That is connected. We mean more than pleasure seeking, which is Freud's thing. We would also mean more than the object as Fairbairn would have it (which sounds very like ours - connecting with others, is not that what we defined eros with? The connection, this wanting more connection?) But there are differences there because the other, the object-seeking, the object that Fairbairn's child or theoretical child infant seeks, is automatically assumed to be a kind of fixed, well-defined, stable, limited object/person - admittedly complex; we recognise that - but not infinite, not full of other [[Dimensionality|dimensions]], possibly infinite and [[imaginal]] dimensions and potentially divine and all that. ^9-2
###### 9-3
In our way we have been talking on this [[retreat]], [[eros]] is not equivalent to a movement or force towards [[oneness]] and dissolution in oneness which somehow needs to be protected against. Actually eros, as we have said, organically creates and retains an otherness, some degree of [[Nondualism|separation]] of self and other and distinction between self and other. So Kohut's idea of achieving the well-boundaried self needn't be fundamental either; it is just partly what happens in the [[soulmaking]] process. Eros will kind of create some sense of division there, some sense of boundary of self. So I am just touching on this really to open something up for future investigation really. But there is - I do not know how this sounds; the distinction is subtle, but I would say quite significant. We are so used to thinking about developmental psychology in other terms that become almost entrenched for psychologists, but I just [[wonder]] what would happen if we thought about eros in the way we are talking about it and soulmaking in the way we are talking about it as really the fundamental drive, if you like. What would that imply with respect to a construction of developmental psychology? And how would we think about various pathologies that human beings have, whatever it is, in relation to that, in relation to that framework? ^9-3
###### 9-4
So the way that we are kind of conceiving of the object that is sought is different that what Fairburn would think, and the sense of [[the self]] also is certainly different that what Kohut would kind of regard of as the achievement. And implicit in what we are saying is this recognition of [[image]] as image. All that is a natural part of the [[soulmaking dynamic]]. The question is, which one of these get blocked and how and at what point and in what direction? So the [[soulmaking]] movement, as I said, does not lead to a dissolution of the self or a reification of the self: "It is really important to have a sense of a real self before you can let go of it" - it is almost like a [[dogma]]. Is that really the problem? It does not reify self or object, but that might be a stage in the soulmaking process. These aspects of the other, a sort of object conceived just less dimensionally, less imaginally pregnant, if you like, might just be a stage, and Kohut's stage of the achievement of the psychologically boundaried coherent self, that is just a stage of the soulmaking process, maybe. ^9-4
###### 10-1
Again, I am just sort of playing with something, but it is quite an interesting thing to start thinking about if you are interested in these kind of things. And again, so much of what we consider or what a lot of a modern psychology considers [[the self]] - which there is quite a range in that ideation or concept - but, you know, just to see how relative it is to western modernist culture as I said before. Ernst Cassirer who wrote a whole series of books, "The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms" I think is the big title, he talks about the Bataks of Sumatra. For them the self was sort of in relationship with a spirit particular, peculiar to that self, I think it was called a [?]; I can not remember. And it is sort of within the person but not really, and it is separate from the ego, from their I. And there can be all kinds of conflicts. So this is not the coherent unfragmented self of Kohut etc. And this was regarded as normal, this is what a person involves. So there is the person, and there is this spirit that is kind of in relationship with them, and there can be conflict: the person wants one thing, the ego wants one thing, and the spirit wants another. But there is something of a power that this spirit has in determining the character and even the future of that person. Certain notions of what is healthy etc. are just actually products of modernist [[Dominant Culture|western culture]] which we take for reality and do not question often. ^10-1
###### 10-2
What would it be also, if we consider developmental psychology - and I have touched on this in other talks in the past - it is like we tend to think the past causes the present and causality just runs from the past. We look for the first causes and we look for the conditions and the environment or the trauma or this and that, and it is moving that way from the past to present. What if causality actually opens? A whole sense of causality that does not just come from the past, that in some way we are called to something in the future. It also comes from the present and [[dependent origination]]. And what is causal is not simply what manifests on a material level in a kind of simply human dimension. So in other words, this notion that the Bataks have in Sumatra of some non-material entity, if you like, being actually quite causative. What is served and what is not served and in fact lost when we constrain our notions of causality? Not just the notions of self, but the notions of causality, as well. "This is healthy, and this is healthy thinking, and this is what a healthy self is, and this is how [[the self]] should be," etc.. ^10-2
###### 10-3
So then considering, thinking about, certain pathologies or the various kinds of pathology, the range of pathologies that can occur for human beings - which of course is related to developmental psychology - we tend to think of pathology, oftentimes, not always, as related to development and child psychology and what may be arrested or incomplete development in some way or another. But beginning to think about that - and really this is just an opening, a sort of pointing at a direction, as I said, but I think it can be quite fruitful - but beginning to think about pathologies. And we have touched on this already. What happens if the [[imaginal]] dimension is available to be opened in a certain direction, for instance in relation to other but not in relation to self, or in relation to self but not in relation to other, and there is a kind of lop-sidedness to the [[soulmaking]] opening and movement there? What would that cause? What causes that, for a start/ But also what would that then result in, that kind of lop-sidedness? What would it result in in the child psychology, in the developmental psychologies, what kind of pathologies if it becomes a long-term kind of habitual mode of being, of seeing, to be lopsided in that way or lopsided in that way or blocked in a certain direction of imaginal filling out? ^10-3
###### 10-4
Or again, as we have mentioned, all this, we can see it mirrored in our moment to moment meditative explorations, but what if this gets repeated and becomes a kind of a way of being in the world, not seeing [[image]] as image, not [[Insight|understanding]] this is image: I see this image and it is image? What happens if there is that kind of reification? Of course that is actually quite common, but we do not tend to realise that, so that in the culture and education there is this real push: make sure the child knows what reality is, and a [[fear]] of the imagination that it lingers too much except in very contained directions (perhaps in art class or whatever, or you know theatre at school or something like that). But this real almost fear of the imagination, so kind of squash the imagination and really emphasise something called reality. Maybe healthy psychology actually, or even a situation as we have been talking about, the [[imaginal]] dimension needs to be allowed more, amplified more, explored more , opened to and opened. ^10-4
###### 11-1
Again, it is a very different way of thinking about psychology, developmental psychology, pathology etc. And I wonder, do children, does an infant, does a child really believe her or his [[Image|images]] and confuse them with reality? When children are playing this does not seem to me to be the case. There is a [[fear]] about that as if we need to prevent the [[imaginal]] growing. I wonder if actually we can trust the human [[psyche]] to see image as image, to understand the image as image. In its natural development, that will be part of what it understands, if it is allowed to, if it is supported to, unless it is subject to some kind of pressure of fundamentalist [[dogma]] - and that can be what seems to be to us a very obvious fundamentalist dogma, some kind of religious fundamentalism of not seeing an image as image, or much more hard to see for us because it is totally woven in to our culture and we do not even see it. ^11-1
###### 11-2
So that is interesting, too. Not seeing an [[image]] as an image is regarded as relatively ok if most people around me agree to see it that way and agree to see it as this is reality, it is not an image. So if my whole community is not seeing this image - shares some image and does not see this image as an image, it is somehow deemed psychologically ok. From outside of that community it looks really pathological, bonkers, dangerous etc.. But I wonder if there is this, as I said, natural, organic movement of the [[psyche]] to understand the [[imaginal]] and to see it as image, if it is allowed to, if it is supported to, if it is not subject to the pressures of fundamentalism or some kind of [[logos]] or whatever that does not allow that. ^11-2
###### 11-3
So again when we think of pathology - and just kind of stating on a bigger scale what we have explored in the kind of moment to moment meditative questions a little bit, meditative navigation, you know - if we think about the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros psyche logos dynamic]], expansion, mutual fertilisation etc., where can that get blocked or out of balance? Is it the [[logos]]? Is it the [[image]] getting stuck somewhere or rigidly identified, not seeing image as image? Is it in the direction of [[the self]], or the other, of the world, of the [[eros]] itself, or the [[love]], or of something like the body? So the body is related to in a way that does not get imaginally filled out. Might be all kinds of belief in an image of the body or an idea of the body, or the eros has got stuck in relation to the body. Something's imbalanced, something's blocked. In that whole kind of circular mandala where everything wants to move in all directions, something gets blocked in the eros, in the [[psyche]], in the logos, in the image of the self, the other, the world, the eros, the body, whatever it is, not seeing image as image, and there comes the pathologies out of that, there comes the incomplete or arrested development out of that, perhaps. As I said, just some ideas to throw out, I think interesting to reflect on and maybe fruitful. ^11-3
###### 11-4
Ok, and lastly just to touch on something that I have touched on before. To my mind, we want and perhaps in the kinds of concepts that we are talking about, in the [[conceptual framework]] that we are unfolding here with the [[soulmaking]] and the explanation of the [[soulmaking dynamic]] and what is involved there, we need and perhaps we have a conceptual framework that implies - already implicit in it - it insists, if you like, that [[eros]] and soulmaking will always elude our final [[Insight|understanding]]. They are always more than we can ever understand. Why? Because the eros, because the pothos in the eros always wants more of whatever it comes into relationship with as an erotic object, and stimulates the eros psyche logos dynamic to [[Create-Discover|create/discover]] more, always more. So expanding, opening, stretching, breaking the boundaries of anything it comes into contact with in creating and discovering more of that thing, including not just [[psyche]] and [[soul]] but eros itself and whatever [[logos]] or idea is involved with the notion of psyche or the notion of eros. So whatever idea of it, those boundaries - and ideas are [[delineations]]; they make boundaries - but they also will be broken open, expanded, stretched etc., just because of the eros psyche logos dynamic. It will eventually move in the direction of eros and the direction of soul itself. Rather it will include them in its whole kind of expanding vortex of movement, involvement, of digestion, of transformation, [[Alchemy|transubstantiation]], creation/discovery. ^11-4
###### 12-1
So in a way this whole idea of the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros psyche logos]] movement and process and involvement means that any [[logos]], any idea, will expand or break in time. In time it will crack. And to paraphrase Leonard Cohen, "There is a crack in everything, that is where the light comes in". So we might think of that in terms of our broken heart, or our imperfections, but we can also just as much apply it to the ideas, to logoi, to [[Conceptual Framework|conceptual frameworks]]. So implicit in the way that we are talking about the soulmaking dynamic and eros psyche logos and all that is this idea of the [[Kabbala|Kabbalistic]] idea of the [[Vessel|breaking of the vessels]] we mentioned before (the Shevirat haKeilim). It will break. And the crack is a [[blessing]]. The light comes in. In other words, there is an illumination. There is a further expansion. Something of the divine - if we amplify that - the light of the divine comes in via the crack. We will reach a point with any idea, with any concept or framework, where it wo not be able to contain or account for our [[experience]] or new ideas or whatever, new observations - the very idea of the eros psyche logos dynamic, maybe that too, that too. It is interesting as an idea, though, because it includes within it this idea of the breaking of the vessels, of the cracks, because of what it implies about expansion. ^12-1
###### 12-2
And actually, I mean, there are already cracks, if you like, in this idea - let us say structural weaknesses, circularities - as there must be with any [[conceptual framework]] actually. Is that a problem? Maybe theory, conceptual framework, theory, is more theatre. Theory is theatre more than reality or truth. Theory is theatre. I do not actually think those words are etymologically related but let us put them together imaginally. Theory is theatre. What does that mean? It is theatre. Theatre, actually etymologically has to do with the gods, theos I think. I am not sure. But that would be interesting too. Theory is part of divine theatre. The question is not about its reality and truth, but what is it serving? What is it serving, a theory, a conceptual framework? We have already said [[soulmaking]], serving soulmaking. And the theory itself is part of [[soul]]. The [[logos]] is part of what we are calling soul and soulmaking. So in a way, we discover a conceptual framework based on our observations and our deductions from that. But we create it, you could say we forge it, with the double implication of what that word means. We forge a conceptual framework. We are forging a conceptual framework. And theory is theatre. So this is a very, to me, a whole notion of concept that is soulmaking, that is fertile, to me. Beautiful as well. ^12-2
