Summary: [[Eros Unfettered Part 2]]

---
<br/>

###### 1-1
So I know it is a lot of material and a lot of detail as well sometimes, so just to state again the kind of larger trajectory or the part of the trajectory we are on at the moment, if you like. We are exploring and opening up the possible [[manifestations]] of [[eros]], and its relation with the [[imaginal]], and the whole breadth of what that means and can mean, and the ways it can arise. And as well as that, we are also looking at, investigating and explaining what eros, when it is opened, will open for us, open to us, and that is connected with our explanation of what we are calling the [[soulmaking dynamic]], the eros-psyche-logos dynamic. So giving examples, and we will move through quite a lot of different examples. Some of them are so-called purely intrapsychic, they may arise in formal [[Meditation|meditation practice]], and some relate to our [[Perception|perceptions]] in the world, of the world, of others, of self, of objects, et cetera. Some are sexual, some non-sexual. All are erotic. And in discussing the sexual, part of the objective of that is to open up the possible manifestations of eros, kind of legitimize, open wider what can be taken and used validly and powerfully as part of our practice. ^1-1
###### 1-2
So we said briefly that when this [[soulmaking dynamic]] is allowed, when the [[eros]], [[psyche]], and [[logos]] are allowed to inseminate each other, to grow, to expand, deepen, enrich, complicate each other in that way, then not just the erotic object, the beloved other, is amplified that way, extended that way, deepened, widened that way, but also [[the self]], because as we said, subject and object, self and other, if we say, are always dependently arising together. So where there is an object, there is a subject. And if I am focusing on an [[image]] or an [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]] of an other in my life, there is both the sense of them as other, as beloved other, but also the sense of self. But oftentimes we miss this. Or we do not allow the sense of the self, we do not allow the same soulmaking dynamic, the same movement and expansion and deepening of eros-psyche-logos in relation to the self as we do in relation to the other. We will come back to this in terms of sort of diagnostics, if you like, things that can go wrong. ^1-2
###### 1-3
Actually we said also that what dependently arises, we could say for now, is not just this polarity of self and other, subject and object, but, if you like, a fourfold meeting, a fourfold co-constellation of [[The Self|self, other, world]] in general, and the [[eros]]. So that a particular kind of eros gives rise to a particular [[perception]] of other, of self, and of world at large, so to speak. And these four, self, other, world and eros, co-constellate. They are mutually dependent. They are almost like facets of the same whole structure or constellation or [[soulmaking]] snapshot, if you like... that is really the wrong word, snapshot, but soulmaking constellation. ^1-3
###### 1-4
So this means that we begin to perceive ourselves imaginally. We begin to see and feel and sense our self as [[image]], the [[imaginal]] [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] of our self. And then moving in our life, we feel that self, gradually, more and more, to have more dimensions to it. We are not just the flatly existing [[Personhood|human being]] that [[Modernism|secular modernism]] would tell us that we are, despite all that [[Centre|interiority]] and maybe even the interiority of an unconscious and all that and repressed things within us. There is a sense of being, perhaps, if you like, manifesting many faces, having within us many imaginal figures, if you like, being many imaginal figures. So there is a dimensionality that opens up through the imaginal practice and through the erotics of the imaginal. The dimensionality opens up not just of other but also of self. ^1-4
###### 1-5
So, for example, one might have an [[image]] that one's practicing with, and perhaps this image has to do with being in a certain relationship with a certain divine figure, this [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]]. Maybe it is a [[Tantra|tantric]] deity. Maybe it is some other kind of god or goddess or whatever. And perhaps in the image one is being held by them, or resting in their lap, or somehow receiving, as a [[Personhood|human being]], their divine [[love]], or being held by that particular [[divinity]]. So right there, what you have in the image is a constellation of human/divine. [[The self]] feels human, and as human, receives succor or encouragement or [[Cultivation|nourishment]] or love or whatever, infused somehow in the imaginal through that divine other, the imaginal figure of divine. And that actually is a very important stage, that human/divine polarity there. The self as human, imaginal other as divine. But I would say that if you hang out in the image long enough, you start to recognize - if you open up the [[awareness]], you start to recognize, oh, the self is also image here in this image. There is imaginal self. And because [[dimensionality]] is always a part of an image, in the way that we are using it, the dimensionality of the self in this image that we have of being in the lap of the god or the goddess, the dimensionality of the self starts to open up, starts to expand. And dimensionality moves towards divinity, so that eventually what happens is you have two divinities sitting there or being together, the self and the divine. ^1-5
###### 2-1
And, if you like, that is another stage. Or rather than saying it is better or worse, it is just a different stage. It is a kind of, I would say, inevitable movement if we allow the [[soulmaking dynamic]] to move in every direction - in other words, towards [[the self]] in the [[image]] as well as towards the other, the object which we are usually focusing on, oftentimes. It is a matter not of making anything happen, but rather of noticing and just being with and allowing something that is a natural, organic movement of the [[soul]], of this eros-psyche-logos dynamic. ^2-1
###### 2-2
There is all kinds of examples here. In the example I gave in the last talk of the raft and the infusion of black blood from the goddess there, and then me going outside and feeling the power and the [[energy]] in my body from this black blood that she had given me, and then becoming myself a [[divinity]], sensing myself imaginally as a divinity, as this dancing, stomping, powerful, thickset, muscular god, also in connection very much with nature, receiving that infusion of the blood, the kind of strange, divine nectar from nature. So there is this spreading of the [[soulmaking]], spreading of the [[imaginal]], spreading of the erotic, and spreading also in this sense of the locus of divinity, if you like, and the faces of divinity. ^2-2
###### 2-3
The same is true in regard to all this when we are dealing with an actual person who has become for us a [[Divinity|theophany]], whatever our actual relationship is with them, whether they are a teacher or a guru or a lover or whatever it is. When actually we have an [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]] of a person, we are also imagining our self in relationship to them. And even if this person is not yet a divinity for us in that sense, there is not that theophany there, we want to see what the [[image]] of self is and what it can be. So we include [[the self]] image, the image of self, in the constellation, in the imaginal erotic constellation. We include that and we let it fill out. Eventually, ourselves, our self, becomes a theophany, or plural, theophanies. We are perhaps many theophanies. And we get the sense, slowly, as I said, of the self as well as the other, as well as the beloved other, as well as the object - could be an inanimate object - being infinite, that we are infinite. ^2-3
###### 2-4
And I do not mean here, in this kind of practice, I do not only mean we are infinite in the sense that our essence is infinite [[awareness]] or infinite [[love]] or some of those openings to a universal essence of [[oneness]], et cetera, so that, you know, you can perceive infinite awareness or infinite love being the fabric of the universe, and we are the same thing in essence, so that therefore I am infinite. I do not just mean that. I mean also infinite in the possibilities of the possible faces, if you like, who can come through us - what I used to call the vertical spectrum of the [[imaginal]], but I might drop that word, vertical, because it has too many loaded connotations. There is this spectrum of imaginal faces that can manifest, if you like, through another, I can perceive, and through [[the self]]. So through myself and through another. And we can get this sense of all that being there as a sort of spectrum of [[dimensionality]] that they are, that we are. There is infinite possibilities there in the [[Perception|perceptions]] of, in this case, one's own [[soul]] in its particularities. It is not in its universality of just being awareness or love or something like that, but in its particularities, in my [[personhood]], in my particular [[manifestations]]. ^2-4
###### 2-5
So this also - we said [[The Self|self, other, world]], and [[eros]], they get co-constellated together, so all this applies, this movement of the [[soulmaking dynamic]] to involve and include the sense of the world and the sense of eros itself, if, if the eros-psyche-logos dynamic is allowed, if it is not hindered, if it is not blocked or refused or dismissed, where it wants to go, et cetera. If the soulmaking dynamic is allowed to spread, naturally, organically, it will start giving [[dimensionality]], giving [[beauty]], depth, all the [[imaginal]] richness, and eventually even [[divinity]], self, other, world, and eros itself. So when a few talks ago I used that term, autoeroticism, and then I said actually we will come back to that as a facet of eros, as something to recognize as an aspect of eros, that there was an autoeroticism that was, if you like, part of eros, what I really meant there was that. What distinguishes, say, an [[experience]] of eros from just an experience of, let us say, [[metta]] or metta with imagination, you know, when we imagine the person that we are giving metta to being happy or whatever, what distinguishes eros from that - and this is something we will come back to in regards to the [[Delineations|distinctions]] between eros and metta, et cetera - is that, one of the things is that eros has this autoeroticism as an aspect to it, meaning that the self is also regarded erotically, is given dimensionality, is attractive in that erotic way that we have been talking about. And not just the self, but also the self's eros. ^2-5
###### 3-1
So whatever [[image]] of erotic connection is involved in the [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]] of the constellation of self and other, whatever [[eros]] [[the self]] is seen imaginally to be participating in, that connection - whether it is penetration or opening or being penetrated or whatever it is - that eros is also kind of regarded erotically, if you like. In other words, that, too, has [[Dimensionality|dimensions]], has [[beauty]]. The eros itself becomes an erotic object. Our own eros becomes an erotic object for us. So not just the other - also the self and the images of the self, that comes alive. There is eros towards the self because the self is given dimensionality, given imaginal dimensionality. And also the eros that the self feels, et cetera, also becomes an erotic object, is given imaginal dimensionality. There is this attraction, almost like wanting to taste it, to connect with it, to open to the very eros more. It has beauty, it has dimensionality, it has [[divinity]]. So autoeroticism. This [[soulmaking dynamic]] is spreading in these different directions, in a way to touch everything. ^3-1
###### 3-2
So in regard to this and [[the self]] and the sense of the self or the [[image]] of the self that is operating at any time, we can say that a [[desire]] is not [[eros]] when it arises from and when it is serving the kind of narrow, habitual and solidified self that is perhaps seeking pleasant sensations or seeking a sense of solidity, to solidify itself, or seeking to aggrandize itself. That kind of desire is more what we call [[clinging]] and [[craving]] or greed, et cetera. That sense of self, when it is narrow, habitual, solidified self, seeking pleasure, seeking solidity, seeking aggrandizement, self-aggrandizement, that self is sensed as unitary: this is the self. It is the real self. There is one of them. And it is also kind of one-dimensional. It is just - it lacks this [[imaginal]] [[dimensionality]], this multiplicity of beings, this sense of shading into [[divinity]], of emanating from divinity and all that. ^3-2
###### 3-3
It is unitary, one-dimensional. It is also reified. There is a sense of "I believe in this self." It is not even an intellectual concept: I believe in the reality of this self, this one-dimensional self and unitary self. And all of that, in opposition to an [[imaginal]] [[The Self|sense of self]], it is not unitary, it has this spectrum of the imaginal, it is not one-dimensional because of that very spectrum, and it shades into [[divinity]] or emanates from divinity or expresses or is a theophany, and it is seen it is an [[image]], seeing image as image, so it is not reified. [[Desire]] that comes out of this narrow, habitual, solidified self is not [[eros]]. Imaginal desire can be eros, is eros. The same with the sense of the other. When that other, the erotic object, is not seen as image, is not recognized to be imaginal, to be seeing image as image, we are not seeing image, when the object is reified, we really believe in this real thing, that, too, gives rise to a desire that is greed or [[craving]]. ^3-3
###### 3-4
Already just as an aside to note: you can hear me going back and forth between the sort of small definition of [[eros]] as just this wanting of connection and the larger definition which implies the [[imaginal]], implies seeing an [[image]] as image, et cetera. So just keep your ears out for that. Now, oftentimes of course, just because of what we have been taught and heard so much, we view [[desire]] that arises this way - so there is desire, and maybe it is sexual desire, maybe it is erotic desire, and yet we view it as if it is - automatically we assume it is a defilement or something bad and that it is something that [[the self]] is doing. Especially if you have heard enough sort of standard [[Dharma|Dharma teachings]] without enough differentiation in them or interpreted them without enough differentiation, then desire is a movement of the self, it comes from the self, it is the self that desires. If I somehow had [[Anatta|no self]], I would not desire, et cetera. Desire comes from the self and desire reinforces the self. So very often we automatically assume that. No, no, no. Maybe we can slow down a little bit and have a look, and sense into this desire, and let it amplify, let it fill out imaginally, with the [[mindfulness]], with the sensitivity to the resonances, with the [[energy body]] and all that. ^3-4
###### 4-1
Because sometimes what happens, if we have this larger perspective on what a [[Personhood|human being]] is, is the [[desire]] arises from the [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]], from, if you like, the [[divinity]], from the deity. Whose is this desire? Is it just this narrow, flat, unitary self desiring? Or is it actually, as [[William Blake]] said, a divine influx? Where is it coming from? Whose is it? Maybe this desire is from Dionysus or whatever, or some other imaginal figure that is more personal, less kind of [[Archtetype|archetypal]]. But then what happens - this desire arises, I automatically assume something about it, "It is from [[the self]]. It is a defilement," et cetera, and maybe that assumption locks into place a certain view, which, as always, the view, the [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]], shapes the [[perception]], shapes what unfolds, and maybe that desire actually becomes [[craving]] or greed or [[clinging]] or whatever we want to call it in a narrow sense through the very view. You understand? ^4-1
###### 4-2
Something to explore. Can only explore this by experimenting. Only explore this by experimenting. What happens if I grant something another possibility, if I enter into another [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]]? What happens? I am not saying it is easy and it does, maybe not for everyone, but probably for a lot of people take a bit of practice, really. It requires certain meditative skills and capacities and arts to be developed. If I experiment, what do I see? What do I uncover? What gets opened up? ^4-2
###### 4-3
Okay. So this, as I was saying, [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]], this weave of [[soulmaking]], the way the tree of [[soul]] grows in different directions organically, the way the fire leaps and catches as the fire spreads, the way it does that and ignites and sparks other things that it catches hold of. And one is - we have said it already - the world. So [[The Self|self, other, world]]. And we have been [[Passion|calling]] this [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]]. I have talked a bit about it in other talks and other [[Retreat|retreats]]. But can give many, many examples, countless examples here. The possibilities again are infinite, infinite. So again, might give some examples that come specifically out of a kind of sexual [[eros]] that is working in the [[imaginal]]. Again, just to open up that possibility where we can sometimes be a little shy, a little doubtful. And of course, you know, I am aware how, as I said earlier, if someone were to just pick up a talk at a certain point and listen, "How on Earth did we get here?", but I really hope you can see how it fits very organically. We are gradually opening certain doors and underpinning them with [[Insight|understandings]] and meditative skills that make them really fruitful and beautiful and important, I think. ^4-3
###### 4-4
So let us go through a few examples. Sometimes, you know, either in an [[Imaginal|imaginal constellation]], like what I referred to before, we perceive a kind of imbalance - we feel very human, and the other, the imaginal other, is not human but divine. And there is a kind of imbalance there, so in a way we might feel somehow less than. This pulls on all kinds of psychological structures and stuff, and we will touch on this. But in a way, sometimes it is just - one [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] at it, it is just the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]] has just not opened up enough yet; it wants to move in every direction, towards [[the self]] as well as towards the other, but it just has flowed more in one direction before it is flowed in the other direction equally or as fully, or it is not being allowed there. We will come back to this. ^4-4
###### 4-5
Sometimes we actually perceive that imbalance in an actual relationship in our life, human to human, where again there is some kind of perceiving of the other, with all their [[imaginal]] depth and [[beauty]] and perhaps even [[divinity]], et cetera, and we somehow feel, or at a certain stage we can somehow feel less than or wanting in some way. So it is relatively common. Perhaps we feel we are in [[love]] with this person or with this imaginal figure or with this person imaginally imbued, if you like. And we can feel that they love us but they are not in love with us. So there is a kind of dimension missing; the [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] are not equal. Or sometimes we want, you know, very normal human [[desire]] to want to see and hear from the other that we are desired deeply (and also sexually, including that, that we are desired sexually). ^4-5
###### 5-1
So giving examples, this is a very common dynamic. Something like this was going on with - I was working in practice with that. And it is like, okay, so there is this imbalance right now. And just giving myself, actually helped by the [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]], the [[Pleasantness|okayness]], the permission to feel and allow this wanting. I want her - in this case, there was the male/female in the [[image]], along sort of biological gender lines. And I want her to want me, I want to see and hear that she wants me, that she wants to let me in, and that means let me in [[Soul|heart and soul]] and physically as well, that she wants to open her body to me erotically, sexually. And the first thing was just kind of being encouraged by the imaginal figure that it is really okay to feel that and to allow that feeling. And that encouragement, and allowing myself to do that, actually liberated a lot of images there, so the whole thing became very fecund as sort of imaginal territory. A lot of images quite quickly. ^5-1
###### 5-2
It was actually, interestingly, I was on my way teaching somewhere as all this - I was sitting on the train, it was quite a long train journey, and working with these [[Image|images]] on the train and going to the station and different… So on and off in that way. And there was a [[Awakening|liberation]] of all these images from the allowing, from the feeling in to that feeling, slightly uncomfortable feeling, but actually allowing it. Liberation of images. And then at some point, tremendous [[energy]] infused my [[Embodiment|whole body]], the [[energy body]] with this, and the image was of roaring, like I was roaring like a lion roars, and bellowing fire the way a dragon bellows fire. So a lot of energy and power in this. Bellowing fire. And in fact, I became flame. I became a being of flames. A lot of, as I said, energy and power felt, but still in regard to the original [[Imaginal|imaginal sense]] of the situation, I still - despite all the energy and power, I realized I still need to be granted admission, if you like. She still needs to let me in. She still needs to say to me, or I felt, "I want you inside me. I want to let you in," et cetera. ^5-2
###### 5-3
This power was not the kind that would force that. So it was tremendous power, yet it did not use it, and in fact you can not force. I mean, in any situation, you can not force someone to want you that way, to want to let you in [[Soul|heart and soul]] and body. So there was this interesting mixture. At the same time there was this tremendous power that I felt, and roaring and bellowing fire, a lot of [[energy]] in the body, at the same time as recognizing no matter how powerful that felt there was also this dependency. I am still, in the [[image]] there, I am still dependent on her, on this [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]], communicating to me, granting me admission. So there was that double sort of constellation existing, the power, tremendous power and dependency at the same time, like in almost opposites coalescing there or rather mixing, co-constellating. ^5-3
###### 5-4
And also the sense, as I tuned in to the [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]], there was the sense, the recognition, that she did grant me admission, she did want me that way, in those ways. So all this was happening: the power, the recognition of dependency, and, as I tuned in to her [[image]] more, the recognition that she did grant me that and she did want me. And what happened then was that there was a [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]] in the sense that the flame that I was, I found myself in a world of flames. So this is a very powerful [[perception]]; it is extremely subtle. It was happening on the train. So I am still aware of who is sitting next to me and opposite me and all that and what is out the window, but at the same time there is like a level of perception, subtle but very powerful, of a world of flames. This is not a [[hell]] realm at all, hell realms of burning and all that; not at all. It felt very wondrous, very beautiful. Each thing, in a way, was a flame, a kind of essence of each thing was a flame, and fire, flame is [[eros]]. So each thing was felt to be kind of expressing its own eros as flame, as fire. ^5-4
###### 5-5
And sensing in to that, each thing, each being, and the world as a whole, its [[eros]], its [[desire]] was that it wanted me to [[love]] it. The eros that I was sensing in to there was each thing, each being and the world as a whole desired, it wanted me to love it. The world, this world of flames, or the world that I now saw - it was the same world - was erotic in essence. Including the sexual, but not necessarily just the sexual at all. It wanted - each thing, each being, and the world as a whole wanted, wanted me to love it. And in a way, recognizing that as human beings - this is a kind of altered mystical [[perception]] - we can feel that call, not just from the beings, the animate beings of the world, but from the so-called inanimate nature and the things of the world. So in myself, I felt the eros, I felt the desire to respond to this wanting in things, this wanting that things were expressing, and I felt that very physically. I felt it in my tongue, actually, predominantly in my tongue, in my mouth, in my genitals, in my hands. My [[Embodiment|whole body]] was involved in this sense. ^5-5
###### 6-1
Sort of just feeling that and taking this - you know, this was happening over some time, and really giving a lot of very sensitive, delicate [[attention]] to it, and opening and working with it. I also felt that the [[eros]] that I was feeling was the eros of the divine. In other words, this was the gods', if you like, or [[Buddha-nature]]'s [[desire]] to penetrate. Because I felt it as a kind of wanting to penetrate, if you like, all things. This is very, again, sexual there. So the movement there was more, quote, "masculine" as opposed to the movement of opening and receiving, which could have been both or either. So this is different. The divine's desire to penetrate all things, to sexually penetrate all things. What does this mean? It is an [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]]. It is not the same as the divine pervading all things with its essence, its [[oneness]] of beingness or [[love]] or [[awareness]]. Something much more particular there. ^6-1
###### 6-2
All the wanting here, the wanting that belonged to things, their wanting to be loved and the wanting that was coming through me to respond to that and to penetrate, all was seen, or evolved through the [[Imaginal|imaginal work]], seen to have divine [[Dimensionality|dimensions]]. I am reminded of somewhere Saint Thomas Aquinas wrote, "All [[beauty]] yearns to be seen. All beauty yearns to be seen." And I do not know enough about him or what he meant by that, but here is a sense of opening to a mystical or imaginal perception, very particular, where each thing, each being and the world wants its beauty to be seen, to be celebrated, to be loved, to have that erotic connection, and in a way, for that to penetrate it, et cetera. So very particular kinds of [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]] opening there. ^6-2
###### 6-3
And another example. Sometimes we might be - again, might be purely so-called [[Image|intrapsychic image]] or actually someone we are in a certain relationship to. And, as I said before, [[eros]] gives rise to, actually supports and nourishes an increase in the way we [[love]], in the ways that we love the beloved other. Also it supports an increase of the ways and the depths and the breadths in which we appreciate, in which we sense and see and feel their [[Beauty|beauties]], plural, and their [[divinity]]. So eros opens all this, because of all of what we have been talking about, [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]]. So that in relation to this, let us say, person in one's life, where we have this kind of relationship, the eros there, if it is allowed, can actually start to, "I love your body," but that also begins to have a fullness. "I love your bones. I love your blood. I love your veins. I love your kidneys." It is got this whole other visceral dimension. And eventually, "I love all your matter. I love all the matter that is you, so to speak." And so the eros is, if you like, moving there to the realm of matter. And it can do this in all kinds of ways. ^6-3
###### 6-4
So what can happen there, the way the [[soulmaking]] infuses and spills over into the [[perception]] of matter, there is so many possibilities. But in this case, could then be that one feels that [[eros]] open up that relationship with the matter of the beloved other and then that spreads into the world - again, talking about [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]] here - spreads to a [[love]] for all matter. But the perception of that matter is not matter as a quantum physicist would conceive it in that kind of way. It is not even divine as a sort of emanation of light. It is matter just as commonly experienced, as we tend to think of this sort of stuff that we do not really think much about, ponder what it is; we just kind of bump into it and assume what every other modernist assumes, that is our [[experience]] of it. So a love for all matter that way. And again, this kind of thing, if it opens up, you might check - it is often easier for this cosmopoesis, this love of matter, to spread to other living matter, things in nature and animals and trees and grass and whatever. ^6-4
###### 6-5
But I remember experiencing this and actually having some bones in front of where I was meditating. You could see how it spread not quite so easily as it did to living matter, but it spread almost as easily to the bones, because they were once living, they were organic. And then a little more difficult to spread but still possible to plastic things that were around. So it spreads to all matter. But not in a way that is linked with or dependent on them providing me with [[Vedana|pleasant vedana]]. It did not seem - it might be easier with that at first, but it does not have to be actually linked with that at all, or even being conventionally beautiful. Because the whole thing started - we do not usually think of veins and livers as beautiful in that sense. But there was this [[love]] for all matter, independent of whether it was conventionally, quote, "beautiful," or whether it was providing me with pleasant vedana. ^6-5
###### 7-1
At other times, this [[love]] and [[appreciation]] for the body of another, the sense of the [[imaginal]] other, might spread to a [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]] that is much more kind of ethereal in its [[Dimensionality|dimensions]]. So many possibilities here, but for example, one might perceive the world around one, the trees, the grass, whatever it is, the buildings, and have the [[perception]] that it is as if light or lights are shining through and into this world of matter, or that this matter and this world is somehow a reflection or a refraction of the light of higher levels, if you like, of other worlds, if you like. But in a way that does not really at all need, and often it wo not, diminish this world as somehow less than or inferior or not valuable, this world and these appearances of every day, but rather giving them [[beauty]], giving them other dimensions of [[Divinity|sacredness]] through the light that comes through them, comes through to them. ^7-1
###### 7-2
So all kinds of possibilities. And again, one might be working with an [[Image|erotic image]] of a beloved other and one might have this sort of wider sense of sexual erotics pervading the image, constellating the image. And maybe we have, like we have alluded to already, the [[Embodiment|whole body]] is penetrated, and independent of whether you are biologically male or female or whatever. The whole body can be penetrated by the [[imaginal]] other or penetrate the imaginal other. The whole body, the whole being is somehow entered. Or, and/or, one can be devoured by the deity or by the god, so all one's flesh and bones, imaginal flesh and bones, is devoured, or one devours this imaginal figure. All these possibilities and permutations. And again, they can give rise, if we dwell in the [[meditation]] with these kind of things and work with them as I said, sensitively and with the [[mindfulness]] there, then they can spread sometimes into a [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]]. And it might be, for instance, the cosmos is mystically devouring me, it is eating me. And this might sound to someone like, "Oh, that is terrible," but actually can feel really wonderful, this sense of participating in some kind of mystical dimension of the kind of being or process of the cosmos. We can say this physical body will dissolve, et cetera, and eventually I have to, in Buddhist language, give my [[Skandhas|aggregates]] back to the universe; this is something different. There is a kind of imaginal, mystical [[perception]] that the cosmos is eternally eating me, mystically eating me, and I am participating in something there at some level, mystical level of being. ^7-2

Or, as I said, the [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]] might be that I somehow am devouring the cosmos. What does this mean? Again, in some ways, I do devour at least part of the cosmos, organically and in ideas. So that is all true. It is giving this other dimension - it is expanding those kinds of ideas into other, more mystical, more hard-to-articulate [[Dimensionality|dimensions]]. And it might be that it moves back and forth between being devoured and devouring the cosmos, being devoured by the cosmos and devouring the cosmos. Maybe even back and forth very quickly. Maybe even, in some completely illogical way, simultaneously the two are happening - the cosmos is devouring me, and I am devouring the cosmos. Of course, again, at a material level, we can see there is a certain truth in that. There is so many possibilities here. So I just want to - really partly what I am wanting to do is just open up the sense of just how much is possible. ^7-3
###### 7-4
One more. I was in [[meditation]] and an [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]], beautiful, she came and kissed my heart and my torso gently, just feeling the resonances of that. In this case actually it did progress to more sexual imagery. But again, there it stayed at a very specific sexual [[image]] and really receiving from her, in the image, dwelling with that and feeling it and receiving through that sexual interaction and the sexual [[love]] there, receiving from her so much tenderness. This imaginal figure was imbuing her sexual love with so much tenderness, and she wanted, it seemed to me as I felt into it, she wanted out of love, out of pure love, to give me pleasure. So working with that in the meditation, this is what is tuned in to, her love and this wanting to give me pleasure. This becomes a kind of wavelength or dimension of the image, very specific and subtle, the tuning there. And needed again to feel the [[Energy Body|whole energy body]] and open to the pleasure there. So this is - well, actually it is not that hard to do, but it takes the kind of skills that we have been talking about developing. Very specific, very subtle tuning, whole energy body involved, and the ability to open to that. ^7-4
###### 8-1
And out of that - and you probably are not surprised at this point - [[samadhi]] came. So I could have this possibility, kind of fork in the road there - you can go just into some kind of [[Jhanas|jhana]] there of the samadhi and leave the [[image]] behind, or stay with the image and enjoy the pleasure of the samadhi, mixed, or let it spread a little bit. And it was the third one that I chose. Because what happened was there was a sense, just dipping into the samadhi a bit, and then the sense of a heavenly realm opening up. Actually, rather it was this world that I was in, the room that I was in, became a heavenly realm infused with [[Eros|divine eros]]. That was the sense, that the world was transubstantiated, transformed - transubstantiated is a better word - into a heavenly realm infused with divine eros. So I had this sense, and even as I say it now, it is like, "What does that mean?" So even then, part of the mind was like, "What does it mean when I have that sense?" In some ways, it was a vague sense. In other ways it was extremely precise and very, very subtle, but it was a sense. It was palpable, a [[perception]], an [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]] of this world, this room and the surroundings that I was in outside, et cetera. ^8-1
###### 8-2
In this [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]], in this [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]], [[eros]] was woven in to the cosmos. The cosmos was felt, seen to be, a garden of eros, a garden of delight. And with all that, of course, eros was right. There was something fundamentally, profoundly right about eros. It has its basic, beautiful, divine place in the scheme of things, in the cosmos, actually permeating the cosmos, and eros is divine. In that imaginal perception that opened up, eros is divine. And all this, there was a tremendous amount of delight and [[Beauty|sense of beauty]], inner and outer, and a lot of [[Happiness|joy]], and the sense was really of profound gift, that all of this was gift, that eros was gift and the cosmos was gift. So the whole cosmos was experienced in such a beautiful way as gift, as erotic gift. ^8-2
###### 8-3
So you can see how that [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]] mirrors or rather has its seeds in the initial [[image]]. And again, I was sort of - because I'd been used to some of this before, was playing with it - was playing then as I opened my eyes and moved around with the equality of [[perception]], if it applied just as easily to, say, plastic or the sound of a plane overhead, just as easily to those kind of things, [[Vedana|unpleasant vedana]] or man-made, not necessarily aesthetically pleasing artifacts, functional things, if it applied as equally to those as it did to the beautiful trees and the sky and all that. ^8-3
###### 8-4
There is quite a bit more to this. This is interesting. So I was playing with that equality thing just to get a sense, and then dipping in and out. And what I noticed was at a stage of this [[perception]] opening, this cosmopoetic perception opening, there was a stage where I felt that it was the divine purpose of the [[Cosmology|cosmos]] to express [[eros]] to me, to [[love]] me and give me delight. So I was, if you like, a graced recipient of divine eros. Now, at the very same time, I knew it was not just me - it applied to everyone else. It was just a matter of people opening to that perception. So I was not in any way singled out there or had any sense of being special, different than other people. ^8-4
###### 8-5
But there was a sense of like - and again, it does not make sense rationally, and it is [[image]] as image, seeing image as image, holding these [[Perception|perceptions]] so that we know image is image. We are not reifying them, we are not clunking down on them as a sort of truth, but yet holding them so that they can have tremendous power. So it is neither dismissing nor grabbing at and reifying, okay, and claiming a truth there. But that was just a stage, because - you know, another part of my mind was like, "Do not be ridiculous," you know? But somehow holding this in a kind of [[middle way]] that they can have tremendous power and efficacy in all kinds of directions, for the being, for the [[insight]], for the understanding, for the perception. But that was just a stage, and eventually it just moved to a sort of more general sense of the [[Cosmology|cosmos]] being infused with and expressing [[eros]], so the cosmos is erotic. And again, with all this, there was a sense of [[dimensionality]] to the cosmos, as if the cosmos has, if you like, different dimensions. ^8-5
###### 8-6
So later, I think it was the same day, and I was [[Retreat|on retreat]] at the time, I sat down to meditate and there was, again, tremendous power and expansion. The [[energy body]] really expanding and feeling very imbued with [[energy]] and power. And following that, letting it constellate an [[image]] of [[the self]], of the energy body, it felt like I had become imaginally a wrathful deity, if you know those Tibetan images of Yamantaka and - there is lots of them, but. A wrathful deity or a divine beast, a bestial deity. So again, for me there was roaring and waves of energy passing through the [[imaginal]] body. So I was not actually roaring; no one would have heard anything. This is the imaginal sense. And it really felt very palpable and strong in the [[Embodiment|physical body]] and felt very, very good, what was going on there with the energy body and the imaginal body. ^8-6
###### 9-1
And then, coming back to the [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]] that I was working with earlier that I described, this divine beast, wrathful deity, with a subtle gesture in the [[image]] claimed her. It made clear through a certain gesture of the body its erotic claim on her: "You are mine." So there is a [[desire]] there. There was my desire there, my sexual and erotic desire. But it also seemed - again, it is like tuning in, noticing what is happening with the image, what else is in the image. There was desire, yes, but also the sense that this claiming, my claiming of her, of this imaginal figure, was, so to speak, already happening. So it is a desire and an act to do something and it expresses desire, but this claiming and this desire was already happening. It is not so much what I or this divine beast wants, but more that it is already flowing from me, from this imaginal self, the divine beast. It is flowing to her eternally, or rather timelessly, or as I think [[Henry Corbin]] used to say, in hierophanic time, in sacred time, a time that does not progress - it is almost like discrete, timeless moments or images. ^9-1
###### 9-2
So it is already flowing, this movement of claiming, the sense was as I felt in, getting the sense of what is actually pregnant in this [[image]], then a dimension of the image reveals itself, which is this hierophanic dimension. We have touched on this before. The [[desire]] there was to give her pleasure. So again, the desire there mirrors her wanting to give me pleasure before, and now it is me desiring to give her pleasure. I could see that the [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]], she enjoys being claimed. She enjoys me gesturing in a way or communicating, "You are mine." So again, all this could sound like it is ego or this or that. Far from it. There is something so light and so beautiful and sacred flowing through it. So it feels very good in the body, and again, the body sort of become flames on and off; that moved back and forth. ^9-2
###### 9-3
And again, I went outside, and again, the [[Cosmology|cosmos]] experienced as erotic. I am in a heavenly realm where the cosmos is, by nature, in its essence at one dimension, erotic. It is an erotic cosmos. But in this case, I was not so much the recipient. So in the cosmopoetic [[perception]] of self and the world or the cosmos, I was not so much the recipient. Rather, it was my role, the role of this [[imaginal]] self or the imaginal role of self, my role and my ability to let [[eros]] flow through me, to flow from me to others, to create [[beauty]] in that way and to give delight and to give pleasure through that. And again, not that that was unique to me; it was clear to me that is everyone's role and ability. But what is unique is the ways in which each of us do that. ^9-3
###### 9-4
So again, you can see how the [[imaginal]] self interfaces or spills over, shades over, into the lived, actually physically manifested self. Because I could say that about my life. I am sure everyone could say that about their life. But the [[perception]] of that gets a whole other [[dimensionality]] and [[beauty]] to it through the imaginal dimension of that opening up, gets this profundity, breadth, richness, [[Papanca|complication]], [[Divinity|sacredness]] to it. I think later still the same day, or the next day, I can not remember, but the same couple in the imaginal [[meditation]], and really focusing then on our [[love]], not so much her giving me pleasure out of love or me desiring to give her pleasure or claim her out of love, but our love, the two of us in sort of mutual, a dance of love, of [[eros]], of delight, if you like. ^9-4
###### 9-5
And when I look around me then the [[Cosmology|cosmos]] after that is again infused with [[eros]], and our dance, our loving, is, if you like, mirroring or echoing or infused with the divine cosmic eros. This is something that can happen between two people, two actual people in their relationship, if they allow the [[soulmaking dynamic]] to expand the sense of what is happening in actual relationship. But you can see in this little three-part [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]] that I have just described, when the focus was more on her, on the imaginal figure's actions and qualities, then I felt [[the self]] to be the recipient of that in the cosmopoesis, reflecting the actual imaginal perception in the narrower [[image]]. And when I lost the cosmopoetic [[perception]], I could regain it by focusing on that aspect of the original image, of her wanting to communicate [[love]] to me through the sexual, through the erotic. Focusing on that in the image brought back that particular cosmopoesis of receiving cosmic love, divine love. ^9-5
###### 10-1
In the second little part there, the focus was on myself and the power and the [[energy]] and the divine beast there giving her pleasure, again, with the [[eros]] and the [[love]], and then the [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]] led to a sense of that in its cosmic place, of my self as a channel, if you like, for the divine's giving or outpouring through me, was what characterized the cosmopoesis. Again, if you lose it, if I lost it, I could focus back on that initial [[image]] and the cosmopoesis comes back, just a little bit and the cosmopoesis comes back. And in the last part when it is more mutual, it is like the us, our back and forth and flow of love together, then again the cosmopoesis there was reflecting that kind of balance, that kind of equality, if you like. ^10-1
###### 10-2
So we can see, begin to see the potential here of what it can open up in the [[perception]] if we allow [[eros]] to have and inseminate fully the whole dynamic structure of the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos]] and that whole movement, the whole [[soulmaking]] movement. And partly, again, I am using these particular examples, sexual examples, just... some of them I am aware, devouring and all this, it sounds quite dark, and claiming, and some people would be cautious for different reasons around that. But I really want to say, first of all, as I said in the other talk, there is a whole range here, and a lot of the even sexual erotic is not dark at all, is very, very light and gentle or whatever. So there is a whole range, but yes, to very - not just of so-called darkness but also just of what is sort of more straightforward or normal or anatomically plausible and all that, to really quite far-out imagery and stuff. So really that whole range is open. ^10-2
###### 10-3
But within that, to trust if something seems darker or stranger. What is happening here is not disrespectful to the [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]], even if the imaginal figure is actually an other person - it is not disrespectful - whom you have that kind of relationship with. It is not lacking in [[love]]. You can notice this. You can feel it. Is it really disrespectful? Do not buy just the first thing that the mind tells you. Is it really lacking in love? Is it really an objectification of that other person? To me, objectification means I have somehow shrunk this person down to not see the totality of the other's being. But have a look if this comes up. Dare to have a look. Is it that? Is it lacking in respect and love? Is it an objectification? No. You will see actually that most often that involves a totality and respect and love is there. Neither is it out of control, and neither does it increase defilement. You can feel in all this, even in the very dark, there are kinds of [[Divinity|sacredness]] and holiness that are palpable there. Again, as I said, the whole movement here with [[eros]] is that it opens up the range of sacrednesses that we can feel and know and [[experience]] for ourselves, firsthand, woven into the [[Cosmology|cosmos]], woven into our being and others, and in ways that make a difference to our life, make a profound difference. ^10-3
###### 10-4
So we said, just to recap a little bit, the [[soulmaking dynamic]], the expansion, fertilization, insemination, deepening, enriching, widening of [[eros]], [[psyche]], and [[logos]], the mutual movement there, mutual expansion, needs to flow or will flow, if it is unimpeded, in all these different directions. So it will flow not just towards the beloved other, the object, the [[imaginal]] erotic object, but also back towards [[the self]], so to speak, and the imaginal self, amplifying that. And also towards the sense of eros itself. Now, we have this phrase, "falling in [[love]]." What does it mean, or I wonder where that expression came from, to fall in love. There is something uncontrollable about falling. ^10-4
###### 10-5
It may be - I do not know, but one [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] at it is - that what is happening here in the expansion of the sense of the other, and the expansion of the sense of [[the self]], and of the [[eros]] itself, and even of the world, as we said, the [[soulmaking dynamic]] will move in all these directions and expand them all, but it does not have a limit. Infinite - the pothos will just keep expanding this potentially. And maybe falling in [[love]], that is what we are feeling. We are feeling like there is a kind of open-ended movement and we are not even sure who we are anymore because it is just being opened into a kind of space in which it keeps opening, and the other, too, and perhaps the sense of love itself, of our sense of love, of eros, is also opened. And it does not seem to be landing anywhere, and it is not stopping anywhere, because the soulmaking dynamic, the erotic dynamic, just keeps opening. And that feeling has this kind of bottomless feeling or limitless feeling to it. So maybe, I do not know, maybe that is part of what happens when we say "I am falling in love. I am falling in love with you." But there is another dimension here which may or may not happen, and actually all of this may or may not happen in actual life. We will come back to what blocks this kind of infinite and comprehensive, potentially infinite, potentially comprehensive movement of the soulmaking dynamic. Because here, as I said several times now, it is possible also the sense of eros is seen and felt erotically and given [[imaginal]] [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] so that, for example, eventually we feel something like a [[divinity]] of eros, or it is divine eros that infuses the [[Cosmology|cosmos]]. My eros, this eros that I feel in me and coming from me is divine, or it mirrors the divine eros, or it comes from the divinity, the [[Buddha-nature]], God, whatever you want to call it, the archetypes. ^10-5
###### 11-1
So all this can be there. And as I said, again recapping, there is an [[infinity]] of possibilities. If the [[soulmaking dynamic]] is not hindered, blocked, in any of its potential directions and movements and unfoldings, then there are infinite possibilities with respect to [[the self]], the sense of the self, the [[image]] of the self, the conception of the self; with respect to the other, the beloved other, of course; with respect to the world; and with respect to [[eros]] itself. That fourfold co-constellated aspect - self-other-world-eros - each of them has infinite possibilities if the soulmaking dynamic is allowed its natural expansion, deepening, movement, fertilization. ^11-1
###### 11-2
So the [[image]] and the idea of each of these - [[The Self|self, other, world]], and [[eros]] - the image and idea, the [[psyche]] and the [[logos]], of each of these and all of these is expanded. So my eros is mirroring the divine eros. That is both an image, it is an [[Imaginal|imaginal sense]], and it is an idea, a logos. So you can see how, in regard to each of these, if eros gets going, if the erotic movement gets going, psyche and logos, they touch everything and everything involved in that constellation - self-other-world-eros - but also the notion of psyche itself, the notion of what the [[soul]] is and what an image is, gets also expanded, enriched, deepened, amplified. And even the image and the idea of ideas. In other words, the psyche and the logos of logos. ^11-2
###### 11-3
For example, we can feel or we can sense, as this whole [[soulmaking]] movement happens, that we are - our mind is, through [[image]] and through idea, through images and through ideas, is participating in the divine mind, the divine [[logos]], if you like. So again, this is an image, but it is also an idea, is not it? Or that what comes to us through image or through, again, through idea, through creative ideas, through concepts, is a manifestation of the world [[soul]], of the, if you like, the soulmaking process of the [[Cosmology|cosmos]]. So these are both images and ideas. But they are not abstract ideas. Again, we are entertaining them, we are feeling them, we are plugging into them, if you like, in ways that really galvanize and catalyze and have a tremendous effect on the being, on the [[perception]], on the [[ways of looking]], on the [[energy body]], on the soulfulness. ^11-3
###### 11-4
So when we talk about [[logos]], we do not mean, as I said I think earlier, we do not mean something abstract. We mean an idea that finds its way into the [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]], that is imbuing the way of looking, and because everything, the whole being is involved, the body, the [[soul]], the [[perception]], the intellect, et cetera, these ideas are not abstract. But the very idea of ideas, the very, if you like, [[psyche]] and logos of logos, the [[image]] and idea of image and idea and soul and mind, starts to also get amplified, enriched, deepened, given [[dimensionality]], et cetera. So the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]], the soulmaking dynamic, will also expand, complicate, deepen, widen the definitions we have of [[eros]], of psyche or soul, and also of logos, of mind. ^11-4
###### 11-5
And in all this, in describing [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]], we might start with [[eros]] in relation to an [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]], but if we work with it, if we allow it, actually it brings an erotic relationship with nature, so that again the eros spreads. So the imaginal spreads to nature in the cosmopoesis, but there is also, wrapped up in that, because all these things are interconnected - where there is eros there is [[image]], where there is image there is eros. We start to feel, as that erotic relationship with nature starts to get supported and opened and nourished and ignited, then the eros and the [[love]] and reverence that are part of that, in relation to nature and the things of nature, animals and trees and all that, quite a lot begins to open up in terms of our [[Perception|perceptions]] of nature. ^11-5
###### 12-1
We tend to have, in our modernist cultures, "Only human beings have intelligence. Some animals have a very limited intelligence, but it stops at animals." But maybe, through this erotic relationship with nature, we begin to perceive, in the [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]] we begin to perceive other kinds of - let us call it intelligence, other kinds of knowing. What is the intelligence of a tree? And I do not just mean the biochemical intelligence of the way it works and photosynthesis and all that, how clever, or the intelligence of evolution. What is the intelligence of a tree? What is the communication of a tree or stones? Something happens in the erotic movement beginning to infuse our relationship with nature. Something happens. We perceive other kinds of intelligence. I am not going to say much about that right now. ^12-1
###### 12-2
We also open up for us in that other [[Ways of Looking|ways of knowing]], also in terms of the intelligence is opened up. So our whole being is involved in what intelligence means. My friend says, "My ovaries know. There is an intelligence in my ovaries." Or in the [[image]], the tongue is connecting with maybe certain body parts of an image of another or something and there is certain communication through the tongue, certain information, if you like, that is being transmitted and received by the tongue. The [[Embodiment|whole body]] is involved in the [[imaginal]] process and in the erotic process more and more. We will come back to this. Sometimes we will say your three centers need to be involved - your belly, your heart, and your head. We will come back to that. So your belly means your body and certainly your sexual organs and that whole sexual dimension of your body and the [[energy]], and your heart center meaning your emotionality and your affect and your [[love]] and whatever other [[emotions]] are going there, and also your head. We talked about [[logos]] and the importance of that. Sometimes shorthand saying "all your three centers need to be involved," but actually it is the whole being. Every dimension of our being, every dimension of the mind, every dimension of the [[soul]], of the heart, and of the body opens up in ways that we might not expect, just because that is what the [[soulmaking dynamic]] does, that is what eros-psyche-logos dynamic does as it expands and fertilizes more and more. ^12-2
###### 12-3
In a nutshell, [[eros]], as I said, supports, opens, ignites, spreads, deepens, widens our sense, senses plural, of [[Divinity|sacredness]]. In all domains, in all kinds of areas, in all [[Perception|perceptions]] and in all kinds of particularities that we would not even have maybe noticed before. And the kinds of sacredness are, if you like, also co-constellated. So the kind of sense of divinity is co-constellated with that other four-part co-constellation - self, other, eros, world. We could add also the sense of divinity there. It is also co-constellated with the [[The Self|sense of self]], the other, of world, of eros. Or even the sense of no divinity. A flat universe is still a kind of constellation. When we have that kind of sense of - let us call it no divinity, then there is a certain kind of sense of self, because only a certain amount is allowed; a certain kind of perception and idea of the other; a certain kind of perception and idea of the world; and a certain kind of perception and idea of any eros or [[desire]] that might arise. So these five actually are co-constellated together. ^12-3
###### 12-4
Maybe I will just finish with something and I will come back to it later. I will just put it in now to seed something. I hope it is not too much. Jung wrote in his memoirs, "We are in the deepest sense the victims and instruments of cosmogonic [[love]]." In another place I think he said, "[[Eros]] is a cosmogonos." That is a fancy Greek word, cosmogonos means something that generates, gonos, generate, or gonad. It is like something gives rise to the [[Cosmology|cosmos]]. So again, you get these myths saying eros or something like that gives rise to the cosmos, but we can see that in the [[phenomenology]] of our actual [[experience]], that eros opens up, gives [[birth]] to the world, gives birth to the sense of [[the self]], different senses of self, other, world, and eros, in cosmopoesis, and also of [[divinity]]. So the eros brings with it, or rather puts into motion, a cosmos-birthing process, actually birthing of many cosmoses, if you like, because there is this [[infinity]] there. ^12-4
###### 12-5
And seeing our [[eros]] as divine, as I said, as gods, as divinities, as the [[Buddha-nature]]'s eros manifesting through us, is a certain view of [[divinity]] there, and of eros. And so all of that, you can see how it - [[the self]] and the world is constellated according to that. All this co-constellates each other in the [[soulmaking dynamic]]. What that means then is also that the kinds of divinity that we are able to open to as [[Perception|perceptions]], as actual experiences, are also infinite, because that five point co-constellation, self-other-world-eros-divinity is infinite in its potential, because the eros-psyche-logos dynamic is infinite in its potential. So the kinds of divinity are endless. The kinds of experiences of divinity, of perceptions, of senses of divinity are actually endless. We are going to come back to this, as I said; I am just throwing it out now. They might be vague. But the perception and the conceptions of divinity are absolutely potentially infinite and varied. And that takes us out of the whole realm of [[dogma]], either secular dogma or religious dogma. ^12-5
###### 13-1
The whole field, including the field of the exploration of what [[divinity]] might mean, becomes infinite in its potential. It is potentially infinite, is an infinitely, if you like, large and expanding playground for us, for the [[soul]], for [[soulmaking]]. We will come back to that. ^13-1
