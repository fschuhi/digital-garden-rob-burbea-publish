###### 1-1
Okay, so in the last part, in part two of this talk, we unpacked a little bit, outlined, laid out a different way of thinking about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and this teaching of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">non-clinging</a></span>, so that one is actually investigating the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, that movement of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, and times of more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, less <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, even less <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, becoming skilful at moving up and down on that spectrum. And opening up, through doing that, first of all, what that word '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>' means, and seeing that it, too, is a spectrum of very, very gross to very, very subtle, and using it as an entry point and a tool, a key for investigation into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span>, and the investigation of seeming reality, the questioning of that reality through the mechanism of playing with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>, centred on the concept of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. And opening up in that way, very deeply, momentously, the actual sense of existence (as opposed to trying to live without <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, somehow live a life that's free of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, etc.)<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > Summary of part 1 and 2" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Summary of part 1 and 2" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1
###### 1-2
And through that, we also saw that it actually, in a way, doesn't make sense to live without <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, to try and live without <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, because <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>/<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> are actually elements, if you like, necessary for the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, for any <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span> to appear, for us to live in the world, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> a world. So in that sense, too, it doesn't quite make sense. But as I said, there's a second problem with this ideal of living without <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. And in some ways, for some people, it will be very obvious. Maybe it's hard for them to articulate it, and certainly hard for them to square it and reconcile it with a more usual <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, but the problem is obvious. For other people, interestingly, the problem and the difficulty here is not obvious at all, and that's interesting. I'll come back to that, actually, throughout this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > Life without clinging is impossible but there is also a second problem with the ideal of living without it" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Life without clinging is impossible but there is also a second problem with the ideal of living without it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2
###### 1-3
But the second problem is, as I said, would we even _want_ to live a life without <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, without <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>? And what would that look like? Have we actually thought out or explored what that would mean, what it would look like? What would such a goal, living without <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>/<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> - I'm just going to use the word '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>' for shorthand - what would such a goal imply and entail for the different domains or areas of our existence, areas and directions of our existence that we really care deeply about? So what would it entail, that kind of goal, and imply, for instance, for our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Activism" data-href="Activism" class="internal-link">engagement</a></span>? Politically, environmentally, the world crying out for this. If I have this ideal, non-attachment, no <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, no <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, very even keel, what might it imply for areas such as <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Activism" data-href="Activism" class="internal-link">engagement</a></span>? Or even our own <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="personhood" class="internal-link">personhood</a></span>, and the range of styles of, if you like, personality or persona or expression in the world? What does this rather simplistic and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Constriction" data-href="Constriction" class="internal-link">constrained</a></span> ideal of 'living without <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>' imply for these areas? What would it imply and entail for art, and our relationship with art, making art? I've talked about all of these in other talks, so I'm not going to dwell very long on this<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > Who would even want to live without clinging" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Who would even want to live without clinging" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3

But for instance, is it even possible to create a large form (say a long piece of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span>, or a novel, or a film or something, or a painting that takes a long time) without <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, attachment, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>? Or training - the long, dedicated training it takes to develop that kind of mastery in spontaneity, if you like, of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Zen" class="internal-link">Zen</a></span> calligraphist, or the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Zen" class="internal-link">Zen</a></span> sword fighter, or the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Music > Jazz" data-href="Music#Jazz" class="internal-link">jazz</a></span> artist? What would this goal of living without attachment, without <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, without <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, mean for the way we <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> our families, family members, friends, deep friendships, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="romantic love" class="internal-link">romantic love</a></span>? What on earth would it mean for the realm of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="romantic love" class="internal-link">romantic love</a></span>, for our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span>? Even for food, and for the kind of care and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to detail and loveliness that some people bring when they prepare food, cook food, and share it with others, offer it to others<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > Art sexuality without desire" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Art sexuality without desire" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4
###### 2-1
So if we have this idea, 'living without <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>,' how then are these areas, these domains and directions of our being and our existence, our life today, how are they then related to and viewed? What is implied about them? Certainly if I have too simplistic an idea of "just drop <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, just <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a></span>," that kind of thing, what then is implied about all that? But also if I kind of piece together and fit together a collection of other <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> concepts, and differentiate between them - attachment, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ and the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a></span>_, this word that I used, _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">hitacchanda</a></span>_, the sort of well-wishing, but also <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, for decreasing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, we could say, in ourselves and hopefully in the world. If we differentiate also, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> outlined <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasures</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to views, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to customs and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span>. If we bring that collection of concepts to bear on all these themes and areas and directions of our life - <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Activism" data-href="Activism" class="internal-link">engagement</a></span>, potential <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Activism" data-href="Activism" class="internal-link">engagement</a></span> of our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="personhood" class="internal-link">personhood</a></span> and the range of styles of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="personhood" class="internal-link">personhood</a></span>, art, family <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, friend <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="romantic love" class="internal-link">romantic love</a></span>, sexual <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span>, sexual expression, food, all that - how is it viewed, if it's either viewed very simplistically, or through this collection of sort of more traditional <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> concepts? How would those areas be viewed<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > Neither simplicity nor more Buddhist concepts is the answer" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Neither simplicity nor more Buddhist concepts is the answer" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
All those domains, our endeavours, our efforts, our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">passions</a></span>, our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">clingings</a></span> and attachments within those areas, some would say, "Yeah, all that's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>. All of it's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>. It's deluded to be engaged and get riled up about these things. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">Personhood</a></span> is complete <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>, and certainly anything that doesn't look like the picture of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span>, of unruffledness. Art, waste of time, really, unless it communicates something about the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">end of suffering</a></span>. Family, all right - granted, it's important biologically, and we owe our parents and that sort of thing, but basically it's an attachment. It's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Romantic love" class="internal-link">Romantic love</a></span>, off the scale as a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Sexuality" class="internal-link">Sexuality</a></span>, just defilement. Food too.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > All of it is delusion really" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#All of it is delusion really" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
And some people would basically hold that. They would answer yes, it's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>. Some would say in response that, with those other <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> concepts that I outlined - attachment, _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="chanda" class="internal-link">chanda</a></span>_, _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">hitacchanda</a></span>,_ till the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">end of suffering</a></span>, etc., the different kinds of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> outlined, and maybe throw in John Bowlby and those kind of people, and the talking about healthy attachment of the infant and mother, the necessity of the sort of evolutionary programming of that kind of healthy attachment - and they would say, "Yes, that's adequate. There's nothing missing in that. We can explain our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span> with all these areas, if we are engaged, if we have different personalities, if we are engaged in art and family <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and all that stuff, it can be explained with all those concepts. Some of it will be <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>, and others can be fit into it as concepts. It's adequate as a net of concepts.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > Some of it is delusion and the rest can be fit into concepts really" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Some of it is delusion and the rest can be fit into concepts really" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
And others will be _screaming_. [laughs] Something in the being will be screaming, "No! No. It's not adequate. No. Something is missing." I'm going to come back to this, as I said, and say more about the difference of opinions and views on this, why some people hold the simplistic view adequate, why some people that net of - I don't know - six or seven <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> concepts will be adequate, and for others, no. This is quite interesting to me, why some people it's very clear that it's inadequate, and for others it's clearly adequate. We'll come back to that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > For some people a couple of Dharma concepts are adequate for others definitely not" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#For some people a couple of Dharma concepts are adequate for others definitely not" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 3-1
But of those areas that I talked about or named - <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Activism" data-href="Activism" class="internal-link">engagement</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="personhood" class="internal-link">personhood</a></span>, art, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> with family, friends, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="romantic love" class="internal-link">romantic love</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span>, food, etc. - what of those areas, and what of those directions, and what is allowed there, and what is allowed to be involved, and what is given place, given genuine place as part of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>, as we're _conceiving_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>? And not just in the sense of, "Oh, yes, be <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a></span> of everything, so <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> includes everything. If you're doing art, you're just <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a></span> of you're doing your art, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a></span> of, I don't know, if you're painting, how does that feel, etc., <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a></span> of the movements of getting too tight, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, in that process." But something, even if we say it's included because <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> should touch everything, there's still a constraint on the kinds and directions of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> that are allowed. There's a constrainment of the idea of what's allowed in terms of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, and also of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of what <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span> looks like, what kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span> and involvements an awakened person has, and therefore what we're moving towards. So it's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Constriction" data-href="Constriction" class="internal-link">constrained</a></span> conceptually and by <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, by <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > Constraints on the kinds of desire or fantasies that are allowed" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Constraints on the kinds of desire or fantasies that are allowed" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
This is a kind of side point right now about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span>, but as you'll see if you stick the course, and you might have heard me say this before, that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span> is anything but a side issue when it comes to this whole area.

We'll talk more about this. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">Fantasies</a></span> are actually also involved in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span> or the idea of "<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a></span>," that seemingly simple, pithy teaching. Actually, usually there's not just a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual structure</a></span> behind that, underpinning it, but there's also a whole <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span>. Could be several.

Maybe <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hermit" data-href="Hermit" class="internal-link">the hermit</a></span>, simple man, simple woman, living close to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span>, wandering in the mountains, in the breeze of the air, and they're being light and fluid, because they're <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span>, light and fluid as the breeze, as the mountain stream that they sit beside. There's a beautiful <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span> wrapped up in that whole <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, maybe other <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasies</a></span>. And as I've said plenty of times in other talks, the way _I'm_ using that word, '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span>,' <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasies</a></span> are not a problem.

There is the necessity of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span>, the inevitability of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span> when we care deeply, when we <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, when we're attracted.

So conscious <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span> is very much a part of our lives - well, unconscious and conscious. But we can make them conscious, and we can recognize, as I said, the necessity of that and the place of that for the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>. I'm going to talk much more about this. But sometimes the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasies</a></span> that we have that come out of our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> background and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> set of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasies</a></span> or ideas are actually inadequate. So the idea and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span> of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, for example, being what is adequate for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="romantic love" class="internal-link">romantic love</a></span> ... I'm saying that the wrong way. When we care about and are involved in or seek <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="romantic love" class="internal-link">romantic love</a></span>, as so many practitioners do, of course, who are not monastics (and actually even some people who _are_ monastics), when that is present, and if we try and think of it, "What's happening here? Why is this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> justifiable?" "Well, it's _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>,_" or, "Well, it's _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kalyanamittata" data-href="Kalyanamittata" class="internal-link">kalyāṇamittatā</a></span>_. It's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="spiritual friendship" class="internal-link">spiritual friendship</a></span>. This partnership is basically based in _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>,_ and it's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="spiritual friendship" class="internal-link">spiritual friendship</a></span>, and that's what my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="romantic love" class="internal-link">romantic love</a></span> relationship, my marriage, is." I mean, certainly I would hope, we would hope, I think we would all hope that _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ is a basis, or at least a component of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="romantic love" class="internal-link">romantic love</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="spiritual friendship" class="internal-link">spiritual friendship</a></span>. It's beautiful. But is that _all_ of it? Does that actually suffice? Does that truly, adequately psychologically represent what's happening? And am I then going to say, "Oh, it's _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ and _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kalyanamittata" data-href="Kalyanamittata" class="internal-link">kalyāṇamittatā</a></span>_, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="spiritual friendship" class="internal-link">spiritual friendship</a></span>, and just <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, basically"? Does that suffice as an explanation<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > Sometimes our fantasies about the Dharma are inadquate e g what it says about romantic love" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Sometimes our fantasies about the Dharma are inadquate e g what it says about romantic love" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^4-1

It cannot <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourish</a></span> those areas that we really care about, _if_ we really care about them<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > When I stretch a limited conceptual framework over things I care deeply about the whole structure will snap" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#When I stretch a limited conceptual framework over things I care deeply about the whole structure will snap" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-2

So we can make all kinds of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a></span> between <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span> of different kinds, etc., and all kinds of divisions - for instance, those that are what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> would call '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span>,' _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="kusala" class="internal-link">kusala</a></span> (_in other words, they lead, either in the moment or eventually, to less <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>), or '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">unwholesome</a></span>.' So we can make that distinction between <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">unwholesome</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">unwholesome</a></span> ones being ones that actually lead to more <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. That's one distinction. But actually, there are all kinds of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a></span> - <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>/<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, like we said.

**(1)** So the first we could call, it's like, that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> for that piece of chocolate cake. I don't need it nutritionally. But I want it. [laughs] That's one level of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, okay? **<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a></span> for <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasures</a></span>**, in that context.

**(2)** But then there's what we outlined in part two of this long prefatory/preface talk, the whole use of, the idea of and the movement of, whether we call it **<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> or whatever it is, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, that whole movement, and exploring the subtlety of that, and how that unravels for us the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span>**, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, and what that tells us about reality, etc. So we're talking about really, really subtle levels of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, and a much more broad range of what '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>' means. As I said, _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_ is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, this belief in the reality of something existing independently from the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. It's a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. I need to refine my practice until I can actually play with the spectrum, actually move that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span> up and down on a spectrum, and see what happens. That would be a second level, direction of what we might call '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>' for shorthand, and the investigation<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > 2 spectrum of fabrication emptiness" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#2 spectrum of fabrication emptiness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-5

**(3)** And then there's a third, if you like, level or direction, what we might call - well, I'm going to call it **the movement of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>**. For instance, our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>-<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">passions</a></span>.

They can be huge. But this movement, what I'm going to call the movement of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, without, unfortunately, in this talk, explaining too much what I mean (that makes it a little bit difficult, but), there are _other_ movements that are not just about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasure</a></span> and relief. Not just about, either, unpacking this notion of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> so that it tells me something about the whole <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of seeming reality. The movement of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span> can be huge, marked, deep, or really quite subtle<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > 3 movement of eros soulmaking" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#3 movement of eros soulmaking" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1

So then the question becomes: what is required of each of these directions or levels of investigation? What is the purpose in relation to all three? The purpose of my investigation relative to that extra slice of chocolate cake or whatever it is, it has one. It has a range of purpose. It's quite limited where it can take me, also, as we've been saying. The purpose of my investigation of that whole concept, from the most gross to the most subtle, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and its relationship with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> and apparent reality and world, that has a different purpose.

So what about the directions, the domains of our life where "let go" does not take us to where we deeply want to go? <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">Letting go</a></span> does not take us to where we deeply want to go. Not just within practice. Because also within practice, "<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">just let go</a></span> all the time" doesn't take me where I want to go. It may not. Probably doesn't. We need lots of approaches in practice, of which <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> is just one. But in the whole of my life, what about those directions, domains, where <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> is _not_ what takes me to what I most deeply want? I'm not talking here about, you know, the kinds of things we do which we can kind of acknowledge and accept as, "Well, I basically did that because of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. I had that extra slice of chocolate cake. I overate just a little bit because someone put this really tasty thing in front of me." Or, "Yeah, you know, every winter I fly to France or Switzerland or" - I don't know where they go in the States - "Colorado or wherever to go skiing. And yeah, if I'm honest, I don't really _need_ that, and I can kind of see, if I really look, that I sort of justify it to myself, because I say, 'I work hard, so I deserve a rest,'" and that sort of thing. But basically, if I'm honest, I can see <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, in that case, has trumped <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ethics" class="internal-link">ethics</a></span> in terms of the carbon output and contribution to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="global warming" class="internal-link">global warming</a></span> and other people's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world. If I'm really honest, I can see that's just a movement of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. I'm not really talking about all that. I'm talking about, as I said, our deeper loves, our deep <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">passions</a></span>, our longings, the movements of our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span> there, as well as - and I'll have to explain this in other talks - more subtle movements of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>.

In these areas, is it ease that we're seeking? Is it just ease or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasure</a></span>? I mean, it might be ease that I'm seeking. Especially if I'm really struggling, if there's a lot of _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, a lot of struggle, it can seem like yeah, basically that's it - that's what I'm wanting, you know? But to varying degrees - and again, this is something we'll come back to - to varying degrees we want, human beings want _more_ than ease and peace. We want _more_ than ease and peace - certainly, probably certainly, than either the kind of ease and peace that is just a matter of stress reduction, or coping with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, painful sensations. Even we want more than the ease and peace of the most profound kind, the most comprehensive kind. So look. See. Even within the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, isn't it more than ease you want? Isn't it more than _that_ that you're looking for? Yes, there's ease. There's the ease of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that we're after.

You've given me some techniques in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> I use to calm down, and to let go of this and that, and have a bit more ease, and then the rest of my life I just can have plenty of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">passions</a></span> and whatnot."

In the world of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>-based cognitive therapy, and actually spilling over from there into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, some people talk about this concept, term, called '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Discrepancy-based processing" class="internal-link">Discrepancy-based processing</a></span>.' Basically, it means when the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is in what they call a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mode of mind" class="internal-link">mode of mind</a></span>, and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is in a mode where it notices the difference between where it _wants_ to be and where it actually _is_, something it <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span> versus how reality actually is. So, for example, very simple, there's a sensation of thirst, so there's a discrepancy - I don't want that sensation of thirst; it would be good to drink. There's a discrepancy between that idea of quenching the thirst, and the reality is, at the moment, there is no water. Therefore, I go to the tap or go to the well or whatever it is. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Discrepancy-based processing" class="internal-link">Discrepancy-based processing</a></span>, that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of differences, directs the organism to meet its needs, if you like, based on noticing differences and trying to minimize that discrepancy<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > Discrepancy-based processing mindfulness-based cognitive therapy" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Discrepancy-based processing mindfulness-based cognitive therapy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-2

So these two things are kind of different gears, if you like - the gear of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Discrepancy-based processing" class="internal-link">Discrepancy-based processing</a></span> and the gear of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> - missing out, it seems, the fact that you can be <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a></span> of a discrepancy and of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, etc., and of the movement, etc. But let's leave that aside.

Or there's hunger, and we notice the discrepancy between that and feeling satiated and nourished, so that leads us to cook. Or again, framing it more biologically in terms of evolution, as would be a lot of people's want, to do that, recognize the discrepancy there's no food, therefore we need to forage or hunt for food.

The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> is called, if you like. There is a deep <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a></span> to explore <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> more fully, more richly, more carefully, more subtly and sensitively. Not just in the direction of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, but in the direction of what we're <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > Some do not have a deep calling to explore desire more fully" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Some do not have a deep calling to explore desire more fully" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-4

And yet others - there's another group: people who feel called, something hears this and says, "Yes! Yes," but there is not yet much <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">discernment</a></span>, much proficiency, much <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> in relation to the classical teachings of pleasant sensation and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, and hanging on to views and opinions, and all of that. And yet, they can't postpone the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>-<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a></span> to include an exploration of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> fully, richly, deeply on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>. Can't postpone it. Not yet got all that more straight-ahead stuff figured out, but I can't postpone it either. Is that just the pull of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>, the impatience of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>? Not necessarily. There are some who actually don't do things in the order that a neat way of framing things might prefer. So be it. And if that's you, then somehow you'll have to figure it out on the way. You'll have to learn how to discern and differentiate between these different movements and kinds of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> and dropping something, etc. And that might be more messy, if you're doing that at the same time as you're investigating and allowing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and fire and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="passion" class="internal-link">passion</a></span>. And it might not look so neat.

It's helpful for them. They need that before they can explore what we mean by, in a way, good <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span> or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>. And some have explored all that, and they feel ready for something new, this other dimension of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>. And again, there are some who can't wait. They have to include and learn as they go along, through different <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>, different practices, trial and error (with the help, hopefully, of the teachers), but to discern between these different movements: what's _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_? What's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>? It's possible. It's absolutely possible.

Okay. So just to conclude this sort of long preface, if you like. Yes, yes, it's important to learn to let go of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">cravings</a></span>, of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span>, of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">clingings</a></span> in life. That's really important. But so much more is possible than that. It's possible, as I said, to take up this notion of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, and actually explore the whole range of subtlety of what that means, and play with it, and learn to modulate it, and see what happens to the dependent <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self, other, world, time</a></span>, etc., and unpack through that, or have revealed through that, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> into the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self, other, world</a></span>, etc. Deep level of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span>. Deep level. Not just those examples of the cigarette <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> and the woman whose number I'd asked for, her phone number. Much deeper level. Talking about the whole <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of this very sense of any reality at all, any <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> at all.

So there's that possibility as we outlined. And there's also this possibility of something we're going to be <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> that is a movement that brings <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> (again, we're going to unpack that, if you're not familiar with these terms). Something that's important for the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, and it's important not to let go of. And actually, we don't completely let go of it. It's operating already. We want to understand that, explore it, develop <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a></span> and an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> that can allow us to open to that, have its place, have the richnesses that it brings. So as I said, it's already there. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">Eros</a></span> is already there. And I'm not just meaning by that this _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="chanda" class="internal-link">chanda</a></span>_, this intentionality or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> for reducing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, for what is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span>. That might be one manifestation of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. I'm not just talking about that though<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > Soulmaking is important for and to the soul so dont let go of it" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Soulmaking is important for and to the soul so don't let go of it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-3

We need, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span> needs, to bring <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to bear so that it recognizes this movement, recognizes <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, delineates it, perhaps, has a way of conceiving and thinking that's actually supportive to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, supportive then to the totality, the integrated totality of what we conceive of as practice. Because that investigation and that movement of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> also, just like the deep exploration of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> through the playing with the spectrum of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, this deep and wide exploration, subtle exploration of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> also, but in a different way, opens up our sense of the world radically, widely, beautifully.

But, you know, _you_ decide what you want. You decide. Some people (and for very different reasons) don't want much depth or much <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, much <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span>. And for different reasons. We'll actually go into these different reasons as part of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, because it's also quite interesting, what's happening there. But some people - and this needs to be respected - that's not what they want. They want some techniques of what we could call kind of self-help, really, and they want some ease, and they want a reduction in _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, and that's great. That's important. Others, though, this opening of the sense of existence, these radical and remarkable openings that are possible in the whole sense of existence, not just of self but of the whole of one's sense of existence, the deep <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, and the deep and wide and eventually all-pervasive movement of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> - these, for others, are the most important things, the things they care most deeply and most passionately about<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > Movement of eros opens up our whole sense of existence" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Movement of eros opens up our whole sense of existence" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-1

But it's not for me, I don't think - I don't think it's for me, I don't think it's for anyone - to tell another person what to want. So, as I said, you decide what you want. But still, we can investigate this whole question of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, and making <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="delineations" class="internal-link">delineations</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a></span>, and see where that leads, and then decide whether we want to go where it leads or not. We can still investigate. It's always up to us where we want to go.
