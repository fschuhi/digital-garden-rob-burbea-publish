###### 1-1
^[test f√ºr [[meta-data]]] Okay, so in the last part, in part two of this talk, we unpacked a little bit, outlined, laid out a different way of thinking about [[clinging]] and this teaching of non-clinging so that one is actually investigating the [[experience]] of clinging, that movement of clinging, and times of more clinging, less clinging, even less clinging, becoming skillful at moving up and down on that spectrum. And opening up, through doing that, first of all what that word clinging means, seeing that it too is a spectrum of very, very gross to very, very subtle, and using it as an entry point and a tool, a key for investigation into the [[fabrication]] of [[perception]], the fabrication of appearances, the [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]] of appearances, and the investigation of seeming reality, the questioning of that reality through the mechanism of playing with [[ways of looking]], fabrication, centered on the concept of clinging. And opening up in that way, very deeply, momentously, the actual sense of existence. As opposed to trying to live without clinging, somehow live a life that is free of clinging, [[craving]], et cetera[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Summary of the first 2 talks|.]] ^1-1
###### 1-2
And through that, we also saw that it actually in a way does not make sense to live without [[clinging]], to try and live without clinging and [[craving]], because clinging/craving are actually elements, if you like, necessary for the [[fabrication]] of [[perception]], for any appearances to appear, for us to live in the world, [[experience]] a world. So in that sense, too, it does not quite make sense. But as I said, there is a second problem with this ideal of living without clinging. A second problem. And in some ways, for some people, it will be very obvious. Maybe it is hard for them to articulate it and certainly hard for them to square it and reconcile it with a more usual [[Dharma]] [[Insight|understanding]]. But the problem is obvious. For other people, interestingly, the problem and the difficulty here is not obvious at all, and that is interesting. I will come back to that actually throughout this [[retreat]][[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#2nd problem of trying to live without clinging|.]] ^1-2
###### 1-3
But the second problem is, as I said, would we even want to live a life without [[clinging]], without [[craving]]? And what would that look like? Have we actually thought out or explored what that would mean, what it would look like? What would such a goal, living without clinging/craving - I am just going to use the word clinging for shorthand - what would such a goal imply and entail for the different domains or areas of our existence, areas and directions of our existence that we really care deeply about? So what would it entail, that kind of goal, and imply for, for instance, our [[Activism|engagement]]? Politically, environmentally, the world crying out for this. If I have this ideal, non-attachment, no craving, no clinging, very even keel, what might it imply for areas such as engagement? Or even our own [[personhood]] and the range of styles of, if you like, personality or persona or expression in the world? What does this rather simplistic and [[Constriction|constrained]] ideal of living without clinging imply for these areas? What would it imply and entail for art and our relationship with art? Making art. I have talked about all of these in other talks, so I am not going to dwell very long on this[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Who would even want to live without clinging|.]] ^1-3
###### 1-4
But for instance, is it even possible to create a large form, say a long piece of [[music]] or a novel or a film or something, or a painting that takes a long time, without [[craving]], [[clinging]], attachment, [[desire]]? Or training, the long, dedicated training it takes to develop that kind of mastery in spontaneity, if you like, of the [[Zen]] calligraphist or the Zen sword fighter or the [[Music#Jazz|jazz]] artist? What would this goal of living without attachment, without clinging, without craving, mean for the way we [[love]] our families, family members, friends, deep friendships, [[romantic love]]? What on Earth would it mean for the realm of romantic love, for our [[sexuality]]? Even for food and for the kind of care and [[attention]] to detail and loveliness that some people bring when they prepare food, cook food, and share it with others, offer it to others[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Art sexuality without desire|?]] ^1-4
###### 1-5
So if we have this idea, living without [[clinging]], how then are these areas, these domains and directions of our being and our existence, our life today, how are they then related to and viewed? What is implied about them? Certainly if I have too simplistic an idea of "just drop clinging, just [[Letting go|let go of everything]]," that kind of thing, what then is implied about all that? But also if I kind of piece together and fit together a collection of other [[Dharma]] concepts and differentiate between them - attachment, clinging, [[craving]], [[metta]] and the [[brahmaviharas]], this word that I used, [[Hindrances|hitacchanda]], the sort of well-wishing but also [[desire]] for decreasing [[Dukkha|suffering]], we could say, in ourselves and hopefully in the world; if we differentiate also, the [[Buddha]] outlined clinging to sense pleasures, clinging to views, clinging to customs and [[Habit|habits]], clinging to [[The Self|self-view]]. If we bring that collection of concepts to bear on all these themes and areas and directions of our life, [[Activism|engagement]], potential engagement of our [[personhood]] and the range of styles of personhood, art, family [[love]], friend love, [[romantic love]], sexual love, [[sexuality]], sexual expression, food, all that. How is it viewed if it is either viewed very simplistically or through this collection of sort of more traditional Dharma concepts? How would those areas be viewed[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Neither simplicity nor more Buddhist concepts is the answer|?]] ^1-5
###### 2-1
All those domains, our endeavors, our efforts, our [[Passion|passions]], our [[Clinging|clingings]] and attachments within those areas, some would say, "Yeah, all that is [[Avijja|delusion]]. All of it is delusion. It is deluded to be engaged and get riled up about these things. [[Personhood]] is complete delusion. And certainly anything that does not look like the picture of [[Steadiness|calmness]], of unruffledness. Art, waste of time, really, unless it communicates something about the [[Freedom|end of suffering]]. Family, alright, granted it is important biologically and we owe our parents and that sort of thing, but basically it is an attachment, it is delusion. [[Romantic love]], off the scale as a delusion. [[Sexuality]], just defilement. Food, too." And some people would basically hold that. They would answer yes, it is delusion. Some would say in response that with those other [[Dharma]] concepts that I outlined - attachment, [[metta]], clinging, [[craving]], [[chanda]], [[Hindrances|hitacchanda]], till the end of suffering, et cetera, the different kinds of clinging that [[Buddha]] outlined, and maybe throw in John Bowlby and those kind of people and the talking about healthy attachment of the infant and mother, the necessity of the sort of evolutionary programming of that kind of healthy attachment, and they would say, "Yes, that is adequate. There is nothing missing in that. We can explain our [[relationships]] with all these areas, if we are engaged, if we have different personalities, if we are engaged in art and family [[love]] and all that stuff, it can be explained with all those concepts. Some of it will be delusion and others can be fit into it as concepts. It is adequate as a net of concepts." And others will be screaming. [laughs] Something in the being will be screaming, "No! No. It is not adequate. No. Something is missing. Something is missing." I am going to come back to this, as I said, and say more about the difference of opinions and views on this, why some people hold the simplistic view adequate, why some people that net of - I do not know - six or seven Dharma concepts will be adequate, and for others, no. This is quite interesting to me, why some people it is very clear that it is inadequate, and for others it is clearly adequate. We will come back to that[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#"Some of it is delusion and the rest can be fit into concepts"|.]] ^2-1
###### 2-2
But of those areas that I talked about or named - [[Activism|engagement]], [[personhood]], art, [[love]] with family, friends, [[romantic love]], [[sexuality]], food, et cetera - what of those areas, and what of those directions, and what is allowed there, and what is allowed to be involved, and what is given place, given genuine place as part of [[Dharma|the path]] as we are conceiving the path? And not just in the sense of, "Oh, yes, be [[Mindfulness|mindful]] of everything, so the path includes everything. If you are doing art, you are just mindful of you are doing your art, cetera, mindful of the [[Embodiment|body]], mindful of, I do not know, if you are painting, how does that feel, et cetera, mindful of the movements of getting too tight, [[clinging]], [[desire]], in that process." But something - even if we say it is included because mindfulness should touch everything, there is still a constraint on the kinds and directions of desire that are allowed, there is a constrainment of the idea of what is allowed in terms of desire, and also of [[fantasy]] and [[image]] of what [[awakening]] looks like, what kind of desires and involvements an awakened person has and therefore what we are moving towards. So it is [[Constriction|constrained]] conceptually and by image, by fantasy[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Constraints on the kinds of desire that are allowed|.]] ^2-2
###### 2-3
So this is a kind of side point right now about [[fantasy]], but as you will see if you stick the course, and you might have heard me say this before, that fantasy is anything but a side issue when it comes to this whole area. I am just going to mention this now and we will come back to it in a much more integrated way in the rest of the course. But notice when such areas as [[Activism|engagement]] or art are considered part of a [[Dharma|Buddhist path]] or Dharma path - for instance in some forms of [[Zen]], some arts are part of the whole form, they are part of the practice, or in some traditions, often [[Mahayana]] traditions, engagement is seen and considered just part of the path, for example in the [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] [[sangha]] and other sanghas - that when they are considered part of the path, although they are often - these areas are articulated or explained or tried to be articulated and explained as having to do or in terms of decreasing [[Dukkha|suffering]], or [[freedom]], or whatever, [[Awakening|liberation]], actually there is fantasy and mythos and a whole sensibility wrapped up in their involvement. In other words, there is a whole mythos around the Zen art. There is a whole mythos of the bodhisattva and the engaged [[bodhisattva]] who is willing to get riled and get dirty on the street, on the avenue, et cetera. There is that fantasy and mythos wrapped up[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Fantasy of the Buddhist path|.]] ^2-3
###### 3-1
I think [[Allen Ginsberg]] and - was it [[Chogyam Trungpa]]? I can not remember. Sitting, cross-legged, meditating on the railroad track in front of the approaching train that was carrying a nuclear warhead, I think, to its silo in - I want to say Colorado or somewhere back in the days of the Cold War. This is my practice, this is what a [[bodhisattva]] does. There is wrapped up in that actually more than one [[fantasy]], but it is somehow connected and made a [[Dharma]] fantasy, a fantasy of what an [[awakening]] person does, what they engage in, what they look like, how they feel, what they do[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#What an awakened persons does|.]] ^3-1
###### 3-2
So we will talk more about this. [[Fantasy|Fantasies]] are actually also involved in the fantasy or the idea of "[[Letting go|let go of everything]]," that seemingly simple, pithy teaching. Actually usually there is not just a [[Conceptual Framework|conceptual structure]] behind that, underpinning it, but there is also a whole [[image]] and fantasy. Could be several. Maybe it is the image "let go of everything" and we hold that as an ideal but it is also a kind of iconic image for us somewhere. Maybe [[Hermit|the hermit]], simple man, simple woman living close to nature, wandering in the mountains, in the breeze of the air, and they are being light and fluid, because they are not letting go, light and fluid as the breeze, as the mountain stream that they sit beside. There is a beautiful fantasy wrapped up in that whole image, maybe other fantasies. And as I have said plenty of times in other talks, the way I am using that word fantasy, fantasies are not a problem. Actually they are necessary. There is the necessity of fantasy, the inevitability of fantasy when we care deeply, when we [[love]], when we are attracted. The problem is when the fantasy is unconscious or regarded as a problem[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#The problem is when fantasy is regarded as a problem|.]] ^3-2
###### 3-3
So conscious [[fantasy]] is very much a part of our lives - well, unconscious and conscious. But we can make them conscious and we can recognize, as I said, the necessity of that and the place of that for the [[psyche]]. I am going to talk much more about this. But sometimes the fantasies that we have that come out of our [[Dharma]] background and Dharma set of fantasies or ideas are actually inadequate. So the idea and the fantasy of [[metta]], for example, being what is adequate for [[romantic love]]... it is... I am saying that the wrong way. When we care about and are involved in or seek romantic love, as so many practitioners do, of course, who are not monastics, and actually even some people who are monastics, when that is present, and if we try and think of it, "What is happening here? Why is this [[desire]] justifiable?" "Well, it is metta." "Well, it is [[Spiritual friendship|kalyanamitta]], it is spiritual friendship. This partnership is basically based in metta and it is spiritual friendship and that is what my romantic love relationship, my marriage, is." I mean, certainly I would hope, we would hope, I think we would all hope that metta is a basis or at least a component of romantic love and spiritual friendship. It is beautiful. But is that all of it? Does that actually suffice? Does that truly, adequately psychologically represent what is happening? And am I then going to say, "Oh, it is metta and kalyanamitta, spiritual friendship, and just [[clinging]], basically"? Does that suffice as an explanation[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Sometimes our fantasies about the Dharma are inadquate|?]] ^3-3
###### 3-4
Can I have a [[conceptual framework]], can I form, can I open to a conceptual framework and a [[fantasy]] that actually [[romantic love]] becomes part of [[Dharma|the path]] and not just in those kind of simplistic terms? The concepts, if I try and stretch too small a set of concepts over the range of things that we deeply care about, the whole structure will snap. It is not adequate. It cannot support it. It cannot [[Cultivation|nourish]] those areas that we really care about, if we really care about them. So we can make all kinds of [[Delineations|distinctions]] between [[Desire|desires]] of different kinds, et cetera, and all kinds of divisions - for instance those that are what the [[Buddha]] would call [[Kusala|wholesome]], kusala (in other words they lead, either in the moment or eventually, to less [[Dukkha|suffering]]), or unwholesome. So we can make that distinction between wholesome desires and unwholesome desires, unwholesome ones being ones that actually lead to more suffering. That is one distinction. But actually there is all kinds of distinctions, [[clinging]], [[craving]], like we said. But what if we made another distinction, based on what I want to get at, and actually say there is three, if you like, directions or levels or distinctions between desires, clingings, cravings, whatever[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#3 distinctions divisions directions for "clinging"|?]] ^3-4
###### 4-1
So the first we could call, it is like, that [[desire]] for that piece of chocolate cake. I do not need it nutritionally. But I want it. [laughs] That is one level of desire, okay? Desire for [[Hindrances|sense pleasures]] in that context. But then, actually what we are talking about is not only desires here and [[Craving|cravings]], levels of craving, but also levels of investigation of craving. So it is important to investigate and have some facility with [[letting go]] of that desire for that cookie, that chocolate cake, whatever it is, that cup of tea when I do not really need it, whatever. This is important, you know? That is one level and direction of desire and it is one level and direction of investigation then[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#1 desire for sense pleasures mindfulness|.]] ^4-1
###### 4-2
But then there is what we outlined in part two of this long preface talk, the whole use of, the idea of and the movement of - whether we call it [[clinging]] or [[craving]] or whatever it is, [[desire]], that whole movement and exploring the subtlety of that and how that unravels for us the nature of [[Perception|appearances]], the [[fabrication]] of perception, and what that tells us about reality, et cetera. So we are talking about really, really subtle levels of clinging and a much more broad range of what clinging means. As I said, [[Ignorance|avijja]] is clinging, this belief in the reality of something existing independently from the [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]]. It is a clinging. I need to refine my practice until I can actually play with the spectrum, actually move that clinging of [[Avijja|delusion]] up and down on a spectrum and see what happens. So that would be a second level, direction of what we might call clinging for shorthand and the investigation[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#2 spectrum of fabrication emptiness|.]] ^4-2
###### 4-3
And then there is a third, if you like, level or direction, what we might call - well, I am going to call it the movement of [[eros]]. For instance, our [[soul]] [[Passion|passions]]. So obvious when it is the bigger ones - falling in [[love]], or my passion for my art, or whatever it is, my passion for expression, my passion for [[Activism|engagement]]. So they can be huge. But this movement, what I am going to call the movement of eros, without unfortunately in this talk explaining too much what I mean (that makes it a little bit difficult, but), there are other movements that are not just about [[Hindrances|sense pleasure]] and relief. Not just about either unpacking this notion of [[clinging]] so that it tells me something about the whole nature of seeming reality. The movement of eros and of soul passion can be huge, marked, deep, or really quite subtle[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#3 movement of eros soulmaking|.]] ^4-3
###### 4-4
So then the question becomes what is required of each of these directions or levels of investigation? What is the purpose in relation to all three? The purpose of my investigation relative to that extra slice of chocolate cake or whatever it is, it has one, it has a range of purpose. It is quite limited where it can take me, also, as we have been saying. The purpose of my investigation of that whole concept, from the most gross to the most subtle of [[clinging]] and its relationship with [[fabrication]] of [[perception]] and apparent reality and world, that has a different purpose. And what is the purpose of my investigation of what we might call the movements of [[eros]], those things that I am passionate about, whether it is [[Activism|engagement]] or art or expression in life or [[love]], different kinds, whatever it is? What is the purpose? And what is the range of possibility of each, of what can be opened up and revealed and given to us, if you like, through each investigation[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#What is the purpose of 3|?]] ^4-4
###### 4-5
Because I can look at my [[Desire|desires]] for chocolate or, you know, I am in my [[Meditation|walking meditation]] [[Retreat|on retreat]] and the [[mind]] says "tea," and then it says "tea" again or whatever, and I can feel that pull, the desire, the sense desire. I do not need that tea. I can look at that until the cows come home. I can spend a life looking at that level of desire. It will not be enough to open up that radical [[Insight|understanding]] of [[emptiness]] that I was talking about in the last part of the talk. Nowhere near, nowhere near. Useful. Of course it is useful. Of course it is useful. But it will not open up that emptiness. It will not tell me anything about this deeper movement of [[passion]], the passions that I have. It is just the wrong kind and level of desire. Investigation specific to that is important, to have some [[freedom]] - otherwise I am just yanked around. Just because the mind says "tea," I have to go and have a cup of tea. You know, of course that is important. But neither that chocolate cake investigation or the tea investigation nor the deep investigation into [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]] and emptiness that I explained will be enough for understanding and opening out and giving [[Cultivation|nourishment]] and life and structure and vision and opening doors in the realm, in the direction, of the [[soul]] passions or the subtle movements of [[eros]][[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Nourishment life structure vision opening doors|.]] ^4-5
###### 5-1
And, conversely, the investigation of my [[soul]] [[Passion|passions]] and my [[desire]] in relation to that and that kind of [[eros]], whether it is really strong or much more subtle, will not be - it will actually tell me something about [[dependent origination]] and [[emptiness]], something, but not enough for the full monty there, the full depth of that. So each has its own - I do not know, door, direction, avenue. All important. But not the same. Can not just lump them all together. Noticing ease when I let go of something that the [[mind]] is [[Craving|grasping]] onto or wanting, when I relax craving, is only the start. It is only the start. And as we said before, that [[letting go]] and the ease that comes from letting go of something that the mind is wanting, grasping, that is not [[Awakening|liberation]]. Or rather, that would be a very limited view of what liberation is, if it is just a state of ease because the mind is not grasping onto the things of the world. And it is not, as we said, a way to live[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Different avenues|.]] ^5-1
###### 5-2
So can we question all this? Is it, in fact, really ease? Is that all that we really want? Is ease all that we really want? And if we are wanting something else other than this relief from the [[dukkha]], are we just going to say that something else is [[Avijja|delusion]]? And from another angle, is [[Hindrances|sense pleasure]] or [[happiness]] all we seek from our [[Desire|desires]]? Is that really what we are after? Sense pleasures and happiness? Or some kind of shoring up of [[the self]], because the self is fragile? Or is it ease, or [[metta]]? Does this suffice to sort of categorize our desires and what we are actually seeking from all our desires? Certainly sometimes we are seeking sense pleasure. I will talk about this. Certainly sometimes I am trying to get happiness. Certainly sometimes I want metta. Sometimes I want ease. What else? You know, it is relatively - I mean, yeah, it is relatively easy to see that sense pleasures are not going to fulfill me. But is there something missing in the way I am thinking about all this[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Is there something missing in the way we are thinking about this|?]] ^5-2
###### 5-3
We can hear this teaching, "let go, [[Letting go|just let go]]," hear it, I do not know, a million times. [laughs] And then decades later it is still not somehow taken root or worked. [laughs] Why? We can say, "Well, it is a deep [[habit]], is not it? [[Desire]]. It is a deep habit." And yeah, that is true. But is it also because it is not enough in terms of our [[Insight|understanding]] of desire, of the range of desires, the kinds and directions of desires and the levels of desire? The framework is not enough for us. We are trying to put it all in one basket, or several very narrowly related baskets, and actually it is not enough. We say, "Why am I not able to live without [[clinging]]? I have heard it a million times." So what about the directions, the domains of our life where "let go" does not take us to where we deeply want to go? Letting go does not take us to where we deeply want to go. Not just within practice. Because also within practice "just let go all the time" does not take me where I want to go. It may not. Probably does not. We need lots of approaches in practice, of which letting go is just one. But in the whole of my life, what about those directions, domains, where letting go is not what takes me to what I most deeply want? I am not talking here about, you know, the kinds of things we do which we can kind of acknowledge and accept as, "Well, I basically did that because of [[craving]]. I had that extra slice of chocolate cake. I overate just a little bit because someone put this really tasty thing in front of me," or, "Yeah, you know, every winter I fly to France or Switzerland or" - I do not know where they go in the States - "Colorado or wherever to go skiing. And yeah, if I am honest, I do not really need that, and I can kind of see if I really look that I sort of justify it to myself because I say I work hard so I deserve a rest" and that sort of thing, but basically if I am honest I can see craving in that case has trumped [[ethics]] in terms of the carbon output and contribution to [[global warming]] and other people's [[Dukkha|suffering]] in the world. If I am really honest, I can see that is just a movement of craving. I am not really talking about all that. I am talking about, as I said, our deeper loves, our deep [[Passion|passions]], our longings, the movements of our passion there, as well as - and I will have to explain this in other talks - more subtle movements of [[eros]]. Apologies for not being able to unwrap all that now, but it is coming[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#The framework is not enough for us|.]] ^5-3
###### 5-4
In these areas, is it ease that we are seeking? Is it just ease or [[Hindrances|sense pleasure]]? I mean, it might be ease that I am seeking. But, you know, especially if I am really struggling, if there is a lot of [[dukkha]], a lot of struggle, it can seem like yeah, basically that is it, that is what I am wanting, you know? But to varying degrees, and again this is something we will come back to, to varying degrees we want, human beings want, more than ease and peace. We want more than ease and peace. Certainly, probably certainly than either the kind of ease and peace that is just a matter of stress reduction or coping with [[pain]], painful sensations. Even we want more than the ease and peace of the most profound kind, the most comprehensive kind. So look. See. Even within the [[Dharma]], is not it more than ease you want? Is not it more than that that you are looking for? Yes, there is ease. There is the ease of suffering that we are after. And what? And what? If you [[love]] the Dharma, it is not just that. It is not just that[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Isn't it more than ease you want|.]] ^5-4
###### 6-1
And then, if it is something outside the [[Dharma]], how do I integrate these two aspects and directions that I care passionately about? There is Dharma, and there is whatever else it is, art or something. How do I integrate that? Or [[romantic love]], or this person that I am in [[love]] with, or whatever, [[sexuality]]. If what the Dharma means to me is just stress reduction and some techniques for stress reduction, then this whole thing is not an issue. "Yeah, thank you very much. You have given me some techniques in the Dharma I use to calm down and to let go of this and that and have a bit more ease, and then the rest of my life I just can have plenty of [[Passion|passions]] and whatnot." But if we really love the Dharma, how do we reconcile, how will we reconcile, this "just [[Letting go|let go of everything]], drop [[Desire|desires]], do not [[Clinging|cling]]," et cetera, "achieve the end of [[craving]]," with the other movements of what we could call [[soul]], our other loves and passions? How do we reconcile it? How does it fit together[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#How do we reconcile "just let go of everything" with our deepest passions|?]] ^6-1
###### 6-2
In the world of [[mindfulness]]-based cognitive therapy, and actually spilling over from there into the [[Dharma]], some people talk about this concept, term, called [[discrepancy-based processing]]. So basically it means when the [[mind]] is in what they call a [[mode of mind]], and the mind is in a mode where it notices the difference between where it wants to be and where it actually is, something it [[Desire|desires]] versus how reality actually is. So for example, very simple, there is a sensation of thirst, so there is a discrepancy - I do not want that sensation of thirst; it would be good to drink. There is a discrepancy between that idea of quenching the thirst and the reality is at the moment there is no water, therefore I go to the tap or go to the well or whatever it is, and the discrepancy-based processing, that [[perception]] of differences, directs the organism to meet its needs, if you like, based on noticing differences and trying to minimize that discrepancy[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Discrepancy-based processing|.]] ^6-2
###### 6-3
And that [[discrepancy-based processing]] is set in contrast to, quote, "[[mindfulness]]," which is, in a certain way of teaching about it, mindfulness is just being with things as they are, accepting, paying [[attention]] to, opening to, without wanting to change, without being interested so much in that discrepancy between how I would like things to be and what is. So these two things are kind of different gears, if you like - the gear of discrepancy-based processing and the gear of mindfulness - missing out, it seems, the fact that you can be mindful of a discrepancy and of the [[desire]], et cetera, and of the movement, et cetera. But let us leave that aside. There is an idea of mindfulness as something that is, if you like, the opposite or complementary to discrepancy-based processing[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#The idea that discrepancy-based processing is the opposite of mindfulness|.]] ^6-3
###### 6-4
And it is acknowledged in the way that they are regarding this [[discrepancy-based processing]] of course it is okay at times. Why? Because it is useful. It is functional. It is instrumental in that, look, if I need a toilet built, I need to first recognize there is a discrepancy between what is and what should be for hygiene purposes or whatever, or there is hunger and we notice the discrepancy between that and feeling satiated and nourished, so that leads us to cook, or again, framing it more biologically in terms of evolution as would be a lot of people's want, to do that, recognize the discrepancy there is no food, therefore we need to forage or hunt for food. So it is useful, it is regarded as useful, okay at times, as long as we do not get too tight, too excited, too agitated[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Discrepancy-based processing is useful of course|.]] ^6-4
###### 6-5
But otherwise, the so-called [[mode of mind]] - this idea of mode of mind is something a little bit related to what I am [[Passion|calling]] [[ways of looking]], but probably I think it is fair to say nowhere near as broad in the ranges and the diversity or the depth or subtlety of what can be involved in that. But otherwise, the mode of mind, the gear, the circuitry, if you like, should revert to a kind of more [[Mindfulness|mindful]] stance, a kind of neutral gear, which will be more easeful of the [[Dukkha|suffering]] that is inherent in [[discrepancy-based processing]][[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Mode of mind|.]] ^6-5

Is that missing something? Are we missing something if we conceive that way? Is that kind of psychology adequate? How do you feel when you hear that? You know, apart from the [[Letting go|illusion of non-doing]], receiving, being, and the [[realism]] that is kind of hidden in there, as I touched on in the earlier talks, apart from all that, can you hear the language there is straight out of the language of artificial intelligence systems? The language of machines, robots. Human as very complex robot. That kind of idea, that kind of conceiving, how much [[Soul|soulfulness]] does it have? How much soulfulness does it support, [[Cultivation|nourish]], allow? Where is the [[poetry]]? Does it have any poetry? And do we really want a psychology without poetry? What are the consequences of seeing ourselves that way? What are the consequences of a psychology without poetry[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Do we really want to have psychology without poetry|?]] ^7-1

Because if I just regard [[Desire|desires]] in terms of [[discrepancy-based processing]], it is funny - I want to kiss you, it is my discrepancy-based processing. [laughs] It has nothing to say, nothing enriching to say about my wanting to kiss you. It does not open that up. It does not [[Cultivation|nourish]] it. It does not bring water to it. It does not fan the fire. It does not bring out the [[beauty]], reveal the beauty, the [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] there. What does it say about this [[music]] that wells up in me, that wants expression? So much that I am willing to sit through all the toil and the frustration and the revising, et cetera, to make, to write a symphony or whatever it is[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Viewpoints which do not nourish|.]] ^7-2
###### 7-3
What does it say about the [[Eros|gaze of eros]]? A gaze filled with eros, imbued with eros. It has nothing to say to address - it addresses nothing in that of real [[beauty]] or value or [[poetry]] or [[Dimensionality|dimensions of our existence]]. Sometimes we can be oversimplistic as human beings, and especially in regard to [[spirituality]]. Sometimes, you know, what can happen is a person can, for decades, kind of abide in and with an overly simplistic view in relation to [[craving]] and [[desire]], these ideas. And okay, they might acknowledge, as I said, that some desires are [[Kusala|wholesome]] because they bring a reduction or they lead to even eventually a reduction of [[Dukkha|suffering]] for self and other. But other desires or movements just have no place. How could I possibly justify an abstract art painting? It has nothing to do with releasing suffering[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#How could I possibly justify an abstract art painting|.]] ^7-3
###### 7-4
And then what can sometimes happen if a person actually clings indirectly (although it seems like not [[clinging]]) to an oversimplistic view of living without clinging, and a simplistic view in relation, in concept and relationship to clinging and [[desire]]? We get to a place after some years of [[Meditation|Dharma practice]] where we are, you know, with [[craving]] and desire, we are kind of - we accept that it is there, and we kind of laugh at it, and we practice [[letting go]] sometimes, and sometimes [[Retreat|on retreat]] we let go of a lot, et cetera, but basically we kind of fall back into a sort of, "Ah, well. [[The self]] or the [[mind]] is pretty wily, is not it, in terms of getting its desires and what it wants, and it is a deeply ingrained [[habit]]." Or there is a kind of cognitive dissonance that does not quite add up. It does not quite fit together, this teaching of letting go of craving and then our [[Passion|passions]] and what we really care about and my [[love]] for this man, this woman, or whatever it is. Does not quite add up in relation to the [[eros]] in our lives[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Oversimplistic ideas not quite add up in relation to eros in our live|.]] ^7-4
###### 7-5
So with all of this there can come kind of a status quo that just stays, a sort of stagnation of exploration in relationship to [[desire]]. What is happened there? Why? Why? And again we could ask, is it that - whether it is the concept of [[discrepancy-based processing]], that kind of language and that kind of way of thinking or framing things or delineating things or other ways, what do they serve and is there something they do not serve that is necessary for us? In the language I have been using recently, does it serve [[soulmaking]]? Does this idea of discrepancy-based processing serve soulmaking? Does it satisfy the [[psyche]], the [[soul]], the depths in me[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Does it satisfy me|?]] ^7-5
###### 7-6
And again, sorry, I am not going to explain that term now. It is coming, or in past talks it is been explained. But just to say this. If we use these words, [[eros]], do we need another term? And I will explain more fully in the next few talks what I mean by that, what we mean by eros. I do not just mean [[sexuality]], although it includes sexuality. I do not just mean it in the way that Freud - I certainly do not mean it in the way that Freud was meaning it as just a seeking of [[Hindrances|sense pleasure]]. I do not simply equate eros and [[love]], and I do not simply equate eros with life force, "It is just life force." So very briefly, and this will beg more explanation if you have not listened to other talks and teachings. But I hope to unfold it in the course of this [[retreat]]. Eros, a [[desire]], a movement of the [[psyche]], of the being, that opens, deepens, leads to [[Soul|soulfulness]], [[Divinity|sacredness]], [[soulmaking]], sense of sacredness. Opens that out. A desire, a movement of the psyche, of the being, that opens out, deepens, enriches, complicates also, our sense of sacredness. A desire, a movement of the psyche that opens the being, unlike [[craving]][[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Eros is more than xyz|.]] ^7-6
###### 8-1
[[Eros]] always has something to do with depth and with expansion and with perceiving of [[dimensionality]] and also with [[beauty]]. Eros always has something to do with beauty. And I do not mean by beauty just what is pleasing to the senses in terms of its sensual arrangement. We will talk more about this later. The eros always has something to do - wrapped up in the movement of eros, in these [[Desire|desires]], these movements that open, deepen and expand the sense of [[Soul|soulfulness]] and [[Divinity|sacredness]] is depth, dimensionality, beauty, [[meaningfulness]]. And again, I am not just talking about necessarily huge [[Passion|passions]], although I am including that. Also very subtle. It is the subtle movement of eros, subtle movements of eros[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Eros is always abc|.]] ^8-1
###### 8-2
So we are talking here about [[relationships]] with [[desire]], [[craving]], [[clinging]], [[eros]], whatever words you want to use, [[Insight|understanding]] and relating to this whole aspect, area, these forces in our lives. I am certainly not saying that every erotic desire, a desire of eros, the movement of eros, needs to be physically acted upon, needs to be made materially manifest. So you know that, if you have listened to some other talks. But the question is, what does this movement of [[psyche]] need? What does it need? Where does it lead? Or rather, are there ways of conceiving, [[Conceptual Framework|conceptual frameworks]], relationships and investigations that open otherwise closed doors for us? And doors that are deeply important to us, that it is deeply important to us to move through, because of what they open to, because of where they take us. So this is really what I want to go into. How can we think about the whole domain and the different kinds of desire, craving, clinging, how can we conceive of all that, what relationships and what kinds of investigations can we bring to bear that open this up for us and do not actually keep certain doors shut that are deeply important to us[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#How can we conceive of clinging which opens something up for us|?]] ^8-2
###### 8-3
Because, and I have said this in other talks in the last few years, some conceptual [[Insight|understandings]] of [[Dharma]], some ways we are thinking about Dharma, even if we do not think we are intellectual - "Be kind. Be present and be with what is. Let go because everything is [[Impermanence|impermanent]], everything is in flow. Relax and try to live without [[clinging]], and this will bring ease. This will decrease or even end your [[Dukkha|suffering]] if you can do that" - a view like that, for a lot of people, it is actually fairly common, a view like that, a [[conceptual framework]] like that, whether it is articulated intellectually, verbally, or not, it will - as helpful as it will be to a limited extent, it will also constrain our vision and our [[experience]]. Constrain our vision and [[The Self|experience of self, other, world]], time, of [[desire]] and [[eros]] itself, for the whole [[Cosmology|cosmos]], inner and outer. Will also constrain the kinds of [[freedom]], the kinds of creativity, the kinds of [[beauty]] that are available to us[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Views can constrain our vision|.]] ^8-3
###### 8-4
I said elsewhere I think, we can have [[Conceptual Framework|conceptual frameworks]] that actually end up constraining our sense of existence, our (what I might call) [[Hermeneutics#Overview|hermeneutics]], the way we are actually interpreting our life, our being, this world, what comes to us in the senses. And when our, through a limited conceptual framework that is not questioned, that is not opened, that is not adequate enough, rich enough, there is the [[Constriction|constriction in the view]], there is the constriction in the interpretation of what I called the hermeneutics of existence, and therefore, out of that, because of [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]], our experiences will also be constrained. And not just constrained because certain sufferings will not happen; constrained in all kinds of ways. We limit our [[experience]] through the ideas that we are hanging on to. Even when we think we are not intellectual and we do not have to think about all this stuff[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#We limit our experience through the ideas we are hanging on to|.]] ^8-4
###### 8-5
So what I am asking is, can we question the [[Conceptual Framework|conceptual frameworks]] that we have? Can we perhaps add to the conceptual framework that is operating for us? Can we find out what it is, for a start, question it, add to it, extend it, deepen and widen it, refine it perhaps? Then it becomes interesting: what then, if we are open to that, what should the order of practice, of the development of practice be regarding the more traditional teachings about [[craving]] and [[letting go]], and if we are going to open up this concept of [[eros]] (which I will do, I hope very fully in this [[retreat]])? What order? Should I do one first and then the other? Or how does it work? How should it work[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Can we question our views refine them|?]] ^8-5
###### 9-1
Some people will need more practice, do need more practice, with just the simple idea of [[letting go]] of [[craving]] that I talked about in part one, gross craving, slightly more subtle craving in their life, so that one is less chained to pleasant and [[Vedana|unpleasant vedana]], being led or dragged around by the craving that comes towards or away from pleasant or unpleasant vedana, sensation. And some people listening, you have already done a lot of that. And yet, you feel no particular need, no [[Passion|calling]], no stirring in the [[soul]] to explore, open up to other kinds of [[desire]], dimensions of desire, or this thing called [[eros]]. And that is fine. Or maybe it is fine. And some of you listening have already done a lot of what we could call the more prevalent or even classical teachings about tanha, craving, and vedana, et cetera, [[clinging]], and yet you now feel, you are now at a place where you feel there is more. And there is a calling, the soul is called, if you like. There is a deep calling to explore desire more fully, more richly, more carefully, more subtly and sensitively. Not just in the direction of [[emptiness]], but in the direction of what we are calling eros[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Some do not have a deep calling to explore desire more fully |.]] ^9-1
###### 9-2
And yet others - there is another group: people who feel called, something hears this and says yes, yes, but there is not yet much [[Insight|discernment]], much proficiency, much [[freedom]] in relation to the classical teachings of pleasant sensation and [[desire]] and hanging onto views and opinions and all of that. And yet, they can not postpone the [[soul]] [[Passion|calling]] to include an exploration of [[eros]] fully, richly, deeply on [[Dharma|the path]]. Can not postpone it. Not yet got all that more straight-ahead stuff figured out, but I can not postpone it either. Is that just the pull of [[Avijja|delusion]]? The impatience of delusion? Not necessarily. There are some who actually do not do things in the order that a neat way of framing things might prefer. So be it. And if that is you, then somehow you will have to figure it out on the way. You will have to learn how to discern and differentiate between these different movements and kinds of desire and [[letting go]] and dropping something, et cetera. And that might be more messy, if you are doing that at the same time as you are investigating and allowing eros and fire and passion. And it might not look so neat. Sometimes things are not so neat[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#and some have|.]] ^9-2
###### 9-3
As I was saying with [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]] and [[papanca]], some need to explore the teachings about [[letting go]] of papanca and complication and [[fantasy]] and simplify, [[Simplification|simplify the mind]], simplify the [[attention]], and this teaching, illusory as it is, of bare attention, because it will be helpful, it is helpful for them, they need that, before they can explore what we mean by, in a way, good fantasy or imaginal practice. And some have explored all that and they feel ready for something new, this other dimension of imaginal practice. And again, there are some who can not wait. They have to include and learn as they go along, through different [[ways of looking]], different practices, trial and error, with the help hopefully of the teachers, but to discern between these different movements - what is papanca, what is imaginal practice. It is possible. It is absolutely possible. But in a way, parallel tracks are running concurrently[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#There are some who cannot wait|.]] ^9-3
###### 9-4
Okay. So just to conclude this sort of long preface, if you like. Yes, yes, it is important to learn to let go of [[Craving|cravings]], of [[Desire|desires]], of [[Clinging|clingings]] in life. That is really important. But so much more is possible than that. It is possible, as I said, to take up this notion of clinging and actually explore the whole range of subtlety of what that means and play with it and learn to modulate it and see what happens to the dependent [[fabrication]] of the [[perception]] of [[The Self|self, other, world, time]], et cetera, and unpack through that, or have revealed through that, the [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]], the [[insight]] into the dependent arising of self, other, world, et cetera. Deep level of understanding of dependent arising. Deep level. Not just those examples of the cigarette craving and the woman whose number I'd ask for, her phone number. Much deeper level. Talking about the whole fabrication of this very sense of any reality at all, any [[experience]] at all. Deep understanding of [[emptiness]]. Deep opening of the being into states of less and less fabrication and eventually the [[Unfabricated]]. What that tells me, what that gives me in terms of this beautiful, radical and extraordinary understanding of the emptiness of all things[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#It's important to explore the whole range of clinging to understand emptiness|.]] ^9-4
###### 9-5
So there is that possibility as we outlined. And there is also this possibility of something we are going to be [[Passion|calling]] [[eros]] that is a movement that brings [[soulmaking]] (again, we are going to unpack that, if you are not familiar with these terms). Something that is important for the [[soul]], and it is important not to let go of. And actually we do not completely let go of it. It is operating already. We want to understand that, explore it, develop [[Conceptual Framework|conceptual frameworks]] and an [[Insight|understanding]] of [[Dharma]] that can allow us to open to that, have its place, have the richnesses that it brings. So as I said, it is already there. Eros is already there. And I am not just meaning by that this [[chanda]], this intentionality or [[desire]] for reducing [[Dukkha|suffering]], for what is [[Kusala|wholesome]]. That might be one manifestation of eros. I am not just talking about that, though[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Soulmaking is important to not let go of|.]] ^9-5
###### 10-1
We need, the [[psyche]] needs, to bring [[attention]] to bear so that it recognizes this movement, recognizes [[eros]], delineates it, perhaps, has a way of conceiving and thinking that is actually supportive to the eros, supportive then to the totality, the integrated totality of what we conceive of as practice. Because that investigation and that movement of eros also, just like the deep exploration of [[fabrication]] through playing with the spectrum of [[clinging]], this deep and wide exploration, subtle exploration of eros also, but in a different way, opens up our sense of the world radically, widely, beautifully. Opens up the whole sense of existence[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Movement of eros opens up our whole sense of existence|.]] ^10-1
###### 10-2
But, you know, you decide what you want. You decide. Some people - and for very different reasons - do not want much depth or much [[soulmaking]], much [[Soul|soulfulness]]. And for different reasons - we will actually go into these different reasons as part of the [[retreat]] because it is also quite interesting what is happening there. But some people, and this needs to be respected, that is not what they want. They want some techniques of what we could call kind of self-help really, and they want some ease, and they want a reduction in [[dukkha]], and that is great, that is important. Others, though, this opening of the sense of existence, this radical and remarkable openings that are possible in the whole sense of existence, not just of self but of the whole of one's sense of existence, the deep [[Insight|understanding]] of [[emptiness]] and the deep and wide and eventually all-pervasive movement of [[eros]] and soulmaking, these, for others, are the most important things, the things they care most deeply and most passionately about[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#You decide|.]] ^10-2
###### 10-3
But it is not for me, I do not think - I do not think it is for me, I do not think it is for anyone - to tell another person what to want. So, as I said, you decide what you want. But still, we can investigate this whole question of [[desire]] and [[eros]] and making [[delineations]] and distinctions, and see where that leads, and then decide whether we want to go where it leads or not. We can still investigate. It is always up to us where we want to go. This is a little bit what I want to go into on this [[retreat]], a little bit of an introduction, and what we want to really fill out and expand and explore in the course[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Let's make delineations and distinctions|.]] ^10-3
