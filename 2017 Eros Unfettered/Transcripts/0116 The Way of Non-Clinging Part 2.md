[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2]]

<br/>

###### 1-1
Okay, so how might we think about this teaching about [[clinging]] and _[[dukkha]]_? How might we conceive of it and this aim of [[Clinging|non-clinging]]? How might we conceive of that and approach it in practice in ways that _do_ open up the full depth of what is possible, and do not constrain the breadth of [[beauty]] and possibility for us in our lives? What are the ways, what are the possibilities of conceiving and approaching, in practice, this area, this theme of the teaching[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#What are the ways of conceiving this teaching|?]] ^1-1
###### 1-2
There are a few ways into this we could go, but let me try and say something briefly about it. One possibility is to take up this theme - not to actually _wait_ until we're in the grip of some obsessive [[contraction]] of [[clinging]] around something or other, and then try and let go of that (important as that is, to address those kind of states of [[mind]] and states of being when they arise, and how can we find some relief, how can we see in a different way). But actually to take up this theme of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and [[craving]] as a theme, and to run with it even when it seems like there's not much <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> going on. So for example, in sitting or [[Meditation|walking meditation]], standing [[meditation]] or whatever, we can actually, as I mentioned in the last talk, in the first part of this talk, begin to get familiar and more and more sensitivity to the [[experience]] of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, this <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of something contracting in the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mind" href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and the [[Embodiment|body]]. Even when there's no thought there, something's contracting towards a sensation, towards an idea, towards an [[image]], away from. So it could be, again, [[Craving|grasping]] at something, or pushing something away, <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> or [[aversion]][[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Experience of craving and clinging of something contracting|.]] ^1-2
###### 1-3
This subtle feeling, we get more and more familiar with, and we notice: this is _[[dukkha]]_. This [[contraction]] itself feels unpleasant. As I said, it might be much subtler than even noticeable in the musculature. We're talking about just the sense of the [[Energy body|subtle body]], the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Energy body" href="Energy+body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, the sense of the space of the [[mind]]. Feeling it, feeling its _<span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_. We're talking about subtle _<span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ now. Feeling that subtle _<span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ and relaxing, relaxing the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" href="Energy+body" class="internal-link">subtle body</a></span>, relaxing the [[energy]], relaxing that tension that's come in with that [[Craving|grasping]] of [[clinging]]/[[craving]], releasing it. So actually working directly with the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="energy" href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> of that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="contraction" href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span>, and releasing the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="contraction" href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span>. Now, you could, as I said in the first part, you could think about the object. You could contemplate its [[impermanence]], etc. Or you can work directly with the actual energetics of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. So that's just an alternative way[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Relaxing the subtle dukkha|.]] ^1-3
###### 1-4
If you start doing this, and you start actually getting quite skilled, there's an art in this, and you start to develop a sensitivity, as I said. And it gets more subtle, because when I let go of, when I release a certain amount of [[craving]], [[Steadiness|calmness]] comes into the being, the [[Embodiment|body]], the [[mind]]. There's an openness. There's a <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span>. And that <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span>, like when the water is calm in a pond or a lake or something, I can actually pick up even more subtle levels of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. So then I can feel that, very subtle, and release those, and even more calm. The very <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span> that's made possible through the release, again and again, finding some <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, releasing it, finding some <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, releasing it, the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span> that can open up through that actually allows me to go deeper, more subtle into the process[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#The calmer I get the even more subtle levels of craving I can pick up|.]] ^1-4
###### 1-5
So this is actually a very enjoyable process. Most people who work that way in practice - it's a certain way of working. It's a very, very lovely way to practise. Very lovely. All kinds of [[beauty]] and softening and ease comes in. We start to notice something. First thing is: oh, yes, when I let go of the [[craving]], the _[[dukkha]]_ releases. So we could say the _<span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ is being [[Fabrication|fabricated]] by the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. I feel, viscerally, in my felt [[experience]], again and again, I just see: <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, _<span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, _<span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>._ And I feel it. I feel its tension. And I feel the ease, the relief of the _<span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ right there. _[[Dukkha]]_ here means something really quite broad in its range, really from quite gross to really, really quite subtle[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Feel its tension feel its release|.]] ^1-5
###### 2-1
But as I develop this practice, and work with it, and enjoy it, and develop my sensitivity and the art of it, I also start to realize that the [[The Self|sense of self]] is also [[Fabrication|fabricated]] with and by the [[craving]]. In other words, the more <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, the more solid the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" href="The+Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, the more [[Contraction|contracted]], the more separate from others or from the world. So this <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" href="The+Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, I start to see it, like the _[[dukkha]]_, move up and down on a <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">spectrum of fabrication</a></span>. Sometimes it's so solid, so dense, so separate. And when I let go of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, and when I let go at the deeper end of this spectrum, the whole <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" href="The+Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> gets much lighter, much more transparent, much more melted, much less well-defined, its edges. It melts into a kind of [[oneness]], etc., or it begins to dissolve in different ways[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Sense of self is fabricated with and by the craving|.]] ^2-1
###### 2-2
And then, correspondingly, there's a mutual dependence the other way: the stronger the [[The Self|sense of self]], the more that tends to build [[craving]], unless we come in and work with it this other way, by releasing. But the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" href="The+Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, the [[experience]] of _[[dukkha]]_ and the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" href="The+Self" class="internal-link">experience of self</a></span> are dependent on <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. More <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, more self, if you like. Less <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, less self gets [[Fabrication|fabricated]]. Very interesting. It doesn't stop there, either, because as I develop this practice, and I enjoy it, and I get into it, and I feel the yumminess of it, I start to see not just _<span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, not just the sense of my self in the moment, but also the sense of the very objects that I'm paying [[attention]] to, and the sense of the very world that I feel myself to be in, that, too, gets correspondingly more solid, more separate, more of an issue, more prominent in [[consciousness]] to the degree that I am <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. More <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, more solid and more dense and more real, if you like, the world becomes, and more oppressive. Let go of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, let go at a deeper level, start to see these dependencies, start to see objects, too, begin to [[Emptiness|fade]] out. They begin to melt. They begin to blur. The very [[perception]] of objects, the very <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of the world, is also dependent on <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> to a certain extent[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Less craving less self gets fabricated - - fading|.]] ^2-2
###### 2-3
Now, some people, this practice really works, and can take you very, very deep. Other people, it sort of comes to a limit, and they have to slightly change the practice, or move to something else. {But basically, one way of [[Insight|understanding]] what's happening there is that we are, at any moment in time, always inevitably engaging what I would call a '[[Ways of looking|way of looking]].' That's a shorthand phrase. What it really means is a <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, a way of perceiving, a way of relating, and a way of conceiving. I use this word, 'conceiving,' not just to mean 'thinking about.' Even when I'm _not_ thinking, I'm still conceiving. I'm still vaguely feeling there's a 'me' and an 'it'; there's a self, a subject, and an object, and it's happening in time. Even if it's just this [[Present moment]], nothing else going on but the [[consciousness]] and the object and a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Present moment" href="Present+moment" class="internal-link">Present moment</a></span>, that's still conception. I've got the tripod there of subject, object, time.} There's still conception[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#The tripod of subject object time|.]] ^2-3
###### 2-4
So I use this word, 'conceiving,' to mean something much, much deeper and more pervasive and more subtle than thinking, but it also includes thinking. So a [[Ways of looking|way of looking]] is (wrapped up, all together, in any moment) the way of relating, the way of perceiving, seeing, sensing, and the way of conceiving. All that together, just for shorthand, I'm [[Passion|calling]] a '<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>.' And in any moment, there's always a <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. There's _always_ a <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. Now, that <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> might have a lot of [[clinging]] in, or it might have less <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, or it might have really a little <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, or it might have really, really, really a tiny [amount], only the subtlest <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. But always at some moment, the [[mind]], the being, is somewhere on that spectrum of how much <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and what kinds of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> are going on in the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#There is always a way of looking with more or less clinging|.]] ^2-4
###### 3-1
And I start to see. I start to make connections here: dependent on the [[Ways of looking|way of looking]], including how much and what kind of [[clinging]] is going on, dependent on that is my [[experience]]. [[Experience]] of _[[dukkha]]_, certainly. [[The Self|Experience of self]] as well. And <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of the object that I'm paying [[attention]] to, the objects and the world around me. Also the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of time. All kinds of things. More <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, more [[fabrication]] of _<span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>,_ of self, of objects, of world. Less <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, less <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. So there is, as I said here, a spectrum of subtlety. It gets extremely subtle, and as we all know, it can be very, very gross, the level of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and the solidity that comes into all these experiences of _<span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, of self, of other, of world[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Experience is dependent on the way of looking|.]] ^3-1
###### 3-2
So when you start to explore this way, apart from the loveliness of this practice, uncovering more subtle levels of _[[dukkha]]_ is actually, contrary to what it might sound at first, like, "Oh, that's horrific, the sort of excavation of more and more _<span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, more and more [[clinging]], [[Dukkha|suffering]]," no. Because I'm feeling the _<span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, I'm releasing it, I'm finding ways to release, it actually feels very beautiful. There's great [[beauty]], great, as I said, yumminess, really, in this practice. Really, really lovely way of practising. As I start to do this, the whole distinction between words like '<span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>' and '[[craving]]' also starts to melt. It's okay. It's valid at a certain level, but actually it's not getting to the really [[Juiciness|juicy]] stuff. It's not really opening things out in a very deep way, to hang on, to [[Clinging|cling]], in effect, to a distinction between <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, for instance[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Uncovering more subtle levels of dukkha is a lovely practice|.]] ^3-2
###### 3-3
What I start to see - I'm just picking this one way of practising as a way in; could pick another one - but I start to see the [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]] and the [[fabrication]] of my entire [[experience]], but let's just say, for now, just of self (but also of objects, as I said). The <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" href="Dependent+Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span>: they arise dependent on the [[Ways of looking|way of looking]], dependent on the [[mind]], and dependent essentially on the [[clinging]]. If we say the same thing in other words, the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of the [[The Self|sense of self]], the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of the [[Perception|appearances]] of things and of objects, and of time and of world, and all of that, dependent on <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. And I start to understand: what does it mean to say that [[the self]] is empty? What does it mean to say that <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span> appear, but they are empty? They're dependent arisings. They're [[Fabrication|fabrications]]. They're illusory. They do not exist. This self-sense that seems so real, this object-sense that seems so real, this thing before me, this thing in my <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mind" href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, this emotion, whatever it is, seems so real - it's a <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" href="Dependent+Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span>. It's a <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span> illusion. It is not a thing in itself, without the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mind" href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> at it or to it[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Dependent arisings are empty fabricated illusiory|.]] ^3-3
###### 3-4
I start to understand. I probably start to see it first more easily with [[the self]], but it can happen different ways. And then maybe that leads to another kind of practice. Maybe I see a certain amount of the [[fabrication]] of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="the self" href="the+self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, the [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]], the [[emptiness]] of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="the self" href="the+self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, through this developed art of [[letting go]] of [[clinging]] and [[craving]]. And I start to have a conviction: "Yeah, this self is an illusion." And so when it feels like I'm looking at something and I see, "Oh, that's me. It's me. I _am_ this [[mind]], or I _am_ this [[consciousness]], or that is _my_ [[Embodiment|body]], or this is _my_ emotion or whatever," I start to see that's kind of an illusion, because I've seen this whole self is a construction, a concoction, a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. It's a _[[Sankhara|saṅkhāra]]_, in the [[Buddha]]'s words. Then maybe I can move to another kind of practice, which is: let me just dwell, in my [[Meditation|sitting meditation]], in my <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" href="Meditation" class="internal-link">walking meditation</a></span>, my standing [[meditation]], and just whatever arises, I'm regarding it as _[[Anatta|anattā]]_. _Attā_ means 'self' in Pali; _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_ means '<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>.' This is <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>. It's not me. It's not mine[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#"Self is an illusion" leads to anatta practice|.]] ^3-4
###### 4-1
So _this_ becomes a [[Ways of looking|way of looking]]. Some people can just move straight into that practice. Other people need to do another practice that enables it a little bit. But at some point, I could, if I want, change practices and move into that. It's another <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. I'm regarding whatever comes up as _[[Anatta|anattā]]_. Whatever comes up is <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>, is not me, not mine. This isn't a big, laborious thinking process. It's a <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. It's immediate. It's something that's permeating my very perceiving. It's a conception, for sure, but it's also a cutting or replacing of the usual unconscious conception, which is "this is me, this is mine." We don't often _think_ that, but we have a sense. I look at my hand: it's _my_ hand. It's not yours, it's mine. A memory comes up, it's mine. I don't even have to think this, but that conception is operating naturally. So we're just kind of letting that more usual conception go away, and replacing it with another conception: not me, not mine. That becomes the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Anatta practice whatever comes up is not self not me not mine|.]] ^4-1

And again, this can be extremely powerful. It's a beautiful, beautiful practice to develop as an art, and there's lots to it. Like any practice, it has lots of subtleties and nuts and bolts. You need to learn how to navigate it and stuff. You can really develop it. Very, very beautiful. What will happen? Something similar to what we described in that practice of releasing [[craving]]: the world of [[Perception|appearances]], the [[The Self|sense of self]], the world of objects, even as I pay [[attention]] to them, they [[Emptiness|fade]] - not because they're [[Impermanence|impermanent]]; because I'm releasing the [[clinging]]. I'm releasing the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, and I see, "Oh, they <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span>." I don't necessarily move to this fast, momentary [[impermanence]]. I'll come back to that in a second, the sense of rapid <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>. They <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span> in the sense that they blur, they dissolve. They <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span> into white light or into blackness or whatever.

So, for instance, paying [[attention]] to, again, a [[pain]] in my back, or in my knees, or whatever, and "_[[Anatta|anattā]], <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>, <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_," and maybe even the [[consciousness]] that knows this _[[Vedana|vedanā]]_, this unpleasant _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_, it's also _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>, <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_. I develop that skill. Takes time. Really an art to develop here, and in stages usually. I've talked about it elsewhere; I'm going very quickly now. And it's not that I then see this rapid [[impermanence]] of _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_. No, I actually see that unpleasant _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_ will - not trying to [[Aversion|push it away]] with this _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_ [[Ways of looking|way of looking]], but it's almost like it doesn't matter. I've let go of the [[clinging]] of the believing it's me or mine, and the _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_ itself first goes towards - actually it might go towards pleasant, funnily enough, but eventually it goes towards neutrality. What was unpleasant either loses its unpleasantness more and more, and may go through a stage of being actually pleasant. But eventually, if I keep doing it, keep doing it even on the pleasant _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_, it becomes neutral. And then, eventually, even those neutral sensations disappear. There's no sensation there in the knee any more. I'm staring right at it. It's not that I'm not paying <span class="transcript"><a data-href="attention" href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>. I'm certainly not distracted. It's faded. It's [[unfabricated]]. And I start to see, again: dependent on the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> is the construction of my [[experience]], my [[perception]], and what appears to me[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Even the pleasant vedana become neutral and even those neutral sensations disappear|.]] ^4-3
###### 4-4
And this practice can go really deep, the _[[Anatta|anattā]]_, in terms of how much it can deconstruct or unfabricate the world of [[Perception|appearances]]. And then, again, based on _that_ practice, maybe I really start to have a conviction: because I see it again and again, I start to see whatever appears (whether I take it as me or mine or whatever), it is empty. Not just that it is not me and it is not mine, but it is, in itself, empty. It's an illusory <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a></span>, to borrow the [[Buddha]]'s terminology. It's a [[fabrication]]. It's a concoction. It's a construction - a construction dependent on the [[Ways of looking|way of looking]]. If I look in a certain way, the world appears, and it appears very solid. If I look in other ways, it appears, but it appears much less solid. And if I look in certain ways, certain <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>, if I pay [[attention]] in certain <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>, it does not appear. This thing that was troubling me, this thing that I loved, this thing that was neutral, fades[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Not just that is not me but it is empty|.]] ^4-4
###### 5-1
And this undermines. When I see this again and again, make the connections, it begins to undermine my belief in the reality of things, the reality of experiences, at _any_ level. And we're talking the atomic components of [[experience]], very rapid - the reality of anything at all. I cannot believe that they have an independent reality, independent of the [[Ways of looking|way of looking]]. That belief that they _do_ have an independent reality is the most fundamental level of _[[Ignorance|avijjā]]_, of [[Avijja|delusion]]. And so, in the tradition, picked up especially in the [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] tradition, [[clinging]], this word, '<span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>,' has a much broader range of meaning than just the kind of gross obsession, etc., hanging on to something for grim life - just the belief that something has a reality independent of the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, independent of the [[mind]], if you like, just that belief. And again, we don't walk around thinking about this. This is how we tend to see, how we tend to view, how we tend to <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. It's the default <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, at a very deep level. That belief, that _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_, is <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. So that _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_, this basic level of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>, of [[ignorance]], _is_ a form of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">Avijjā</a></span>_ is grouped together with other forms of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Avijja as belief in an independent reality is a form of clinging|.]] ^5-1
###### 5-2
And then I can start to actually employ another [[Ways of looking|way of looking]], through the development of these arts, these practices. When this [[Insight|understanding]], when I have conviction in my heart that something in me knows - I've seen them [[Emptiness|fade]] dependent on the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, and I see how [[clinging]] and [[The Self|self-view]] constructs the [[fabrication]], [[Fabrication|fabricates]] objects, constructs the [[Perception|appearances]] of seemingly solid, separate things - when I've seen that enough, something in my heart is convinced, and I can adopt deliberately, play with, entertain a <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> in practice, in whatever posture in practice, that just sees things, and the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> says, "Empty, empty, empty" - meaning I _know_; I don't have to have this shorthand whole thinking thing. Again, it's very fluid, very direct, a very light <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>: I know you're empty. I've seen. I know you're empty, because I know that you <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span> when the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> has less _[[Ignorance|avijjā]]_ in it, when there's less <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" href="The+Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span>, when I see you as [[Anatta|not-self]], or whatever it is[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Practice "empty empty empty"|.]] ^5-2
###### 5-3
So I can start to look at things and just see them as "empty, empty, empty." What happens then? An even deeper level of [[Emptiness|fading]]. And this applies to _everything_, without question. The barest sense of subject, just a sense of [[consciousness]], a momentary <span class="transcript"><a data-href="consciousness" href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, or a vast, eternal-seeming [[awareness]] - empty, [[fabrication]]. Much less [[Fabrication|fabricated]] than our normal sense of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="consciousness" href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> or <span class="transcript"><a data-href="awareness" href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, but still a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>, empty. The [[Present moment]], however brief that seems or eternal that seems - <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>, empty. Whatever object, however vague, however light, however [[Spaciousness|spacious]], however transparent-seeming - empty, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. And there's an even deeper <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a></span> because the _[[Ignorance|avijjā]]_ is being withdrawn, being undermined in that moment. So you can go into this, the whole process, taking up the teaching of [[clinging]], and going deeper and deeper with my [[Insight|understanding]] of what's involved in this term, '<span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>,' and how to actually work with it to _not_ [[Clinging|cling]] in the moment[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Emptiness practice results in an even deeper level of fading|.]] ^5-3
###### 5-4
We actually start to see that even [[attention]] [is a form of [[clinging]]]. To have any [[experience]], I need to in some way pay <span class="transcript"><a data-href="attention" href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. Even if it's a very open <span class="transcript"><a data-href="attention" href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> - I'm attending to the totality, [[Awareness|vast awareness]] - there's <span class="transcript"><a data-href="attention" href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> there. And the [[mind]] is actually, in a subtle way, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. [[Attention]] works through a kind of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. I shut _this_ out so I have this <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. The <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mind" href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> kind of grasps - like a pair of calipers, it grasps at the object that we're paying <span class="transcript"><a data-href="attention" href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to. Even <span class="transcript"><a data-href="attention" href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> is a form of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. So these [[Delineations|distinctions]] (if we go back to the thing about the [[Dependent Origination|twelve links of dependent origination]], distinguishing between [[craving]] and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and _[[Sankhara|saṅkhārā]]_, etc.), as we go deeper into the whole thing, the very [[delineations]] that we had started off with (and that are useful, as I said, at a certain level), they begin to blur, and we see how <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sankhara" data-href="Sankhara" href="Sankhara" class="internal-link">saṅkhārā</a></span>_, _[[Ignorance|avijjā]]_, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="attention" href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> - these notions overlap. They're all different forms of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, if you like[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Even attention is a form of clinging|.]] ^5-4
###### 6-1
Even in the examples I gave earlier - for instance, the example of me fretting over hoping that this woman calls me - you can see in that, there's the [[The Self|self-view]] that I'm (what was it?), the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" href="The+Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span> of perhaps I'm not attractive, or I'm not okay somehow, and the belief that it would prove that I _am_ okay and attractive if she called me, etc. You can see that that _[[Ignorance|avijjā]]_ is already a [[clinging]]. I'm <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to that belief, and the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" href="The+Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> there is already a kind of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. My tendency to view things that way, and my trying to prove it, that movement to prove it is also a kind of [[craving]] and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. So even at that level, but certainly as you go deeper into this whole question in practice, practising in these beautiful ways, very delicate, very subtle, but enormously opening in terms of the [[freedom]], and what they open in the sense of existence. You start to see that this word, '<span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>,' has a huge range of subtlety. It covers a lot of ground. And as I said, all kinds of [[Delineations|distinctions]] start to blur and overlap, etc[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#"Clinging" has a huge range of subtlelty|.]] ^6-1
###### 6-2
But essentially, I learn how to play with releasing [[clinging]] in the moment, and '<span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>' in this very broad sense, at different ranges of subtlety, through playing with different [[Ways of looking]], and that develops. I see that as I do this, and I let go of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> very, very deeply, at a very deep level, the world of [[Perception|appearances]] ([[The Self|self, other, world, time]], etc.) is [[Fabrication|fabricated]] less and less. And there's a spectrum here of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, of self-sense, of _[[dukkha]]_, of sense of objects, of solidity of time - all of that. It's one <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">spectrum of fabrication</a></span>. And if I develop the art of this, eventually I can - language is difficult, but eventually there can be a complete unfabricating. Nothing is <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span> at all: no subject, no object, no time (past, future or present), no space. Something that language cannot even approach except by negatives. And through that seeing of that dependent [[fabrication]], dependent [[Emptiness|fading]], dependent unfabricating, and the totality of that in an [[experience]] of the [[Unfabricated]], I understand, I need to understand something: all things, all experiences, all [[Phenomenon|phenomena]], are empty. 'Empty' meaning they do not exist independent of the [[mind]], independent of the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#There can be a complete unfabrication|.]] ^6-2
###### 6-3
So I start with a very, if you like, rudimentary and simple concept of [[Ways of looking]]: there are different <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span> at things, and they involve different kinds of [[clinging]], to different degrees. And I can see a certain amount of [[fabrication]]. Included, as I said, in the idea of '<span class="transcript"><a data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>,' is really the way of relating, the way of conceiving, the way of sensing, if you like, perceiving, framing, and all kinds of things. All that's wrapped up in the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. And this concept, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>, and the concept of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> - very, very simple concepts. So even a beginner in [[meditation]] - actually, even someone who doesn't meditate - can see this. Every [[Personhood|human being]] knows what _[[Papanca|papañca]]_ [is]. If you talk about _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_, every <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> will recognize that. Even someone who's not gone within 10 miles of a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="meditation" href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> cushion knows the [[experience]] of _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>,_ and knows the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of coming out of _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_ into a more normal state of [[consciousness]][[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Everybody knows what papanca is|.]] ^6-3
###### 6-4
So right there is a segment of this [[Fabrication|spectrum of fabrication]] - _[[Papanca|papañca]]_ being much more <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span>, [[the self]] so dense, so tight; the _[[dukkha]]_ being <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span> more intensely; and the sense of issue or object or whatever it is we're obsessing about also more intense, more real, more dense, all of that. More normal state of [[consciousness]], still the [[The Self|sense of self]], very real, etc., but less oppressive, less dense, less separate, less [[Contraction|contracted]], and similarly with the issue, etc[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Papance on the spectrum of fabrication|.]] ^6-4
###### 7-1
And then a beginner who's just exposed to [[mindfulness]], and maybe even first [[retreat]] or first course in <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mindfulness" href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, actually gets tastes of states that involve even less [[fabrication]] than the normal state - just a sense of this self being less solid, less [[Fabrication|fabricated]] in different ways possible, and even more ease than what they've known through a normal state of [[consciousness]]. So there, our little spectrum (_[[Papanca|papañca]]_ at one extreme end; the normal state of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="consciousness" href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, if you like, everyday walking around; and then, if we say, a state of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mindfulness" href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> when it's, quote, 'going quite well'), right there are three points on a spectrum, and the level of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mindfulness" href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> is, of those three, the least <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span>. So right there, it's like, this isn't rocket science. What's possible, though, is to really extend that spectrum, and really see how all our [[experience]] fits onto that, and in a way, the whole [[Dharma]] fits onto that. The whole <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> is saying something about this <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">spectrum of fabrication</a></span>, and its relationship with [[clinging]], and what that says about the world of [[Perception|appearances]] and their apparent reality[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#The whole Dharma fits on a spectrum|.]] ^7-1
###### 7-2
So really what we're doing is taking these concepts of [[Ways of looking]] and [[fabrication]] and, through practice, through experiential playing with <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>, we're contemplating the dependence of [[Perception|appearances]] on the [[mind]] and on [[clinging]], on the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> and on <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. Going back to, return to, if I'm contemplating [[impermanence]], rapid <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> in sort of intense perhaps [[Mahasi Sayadaw|Mahāsi]]-style or [[Goenka|Goenka-style]] practice, etc., or just other forms of practice, and that's a <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>: I'm looking at <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, and I get into a kind of groove of seeing beginnings and endings of things. It's a <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. And then it's a <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> that tends to, if you like, [[Fabrication|fabricate]] what it sees. So I start to see process. I start to see more beginnings and endings. And I start to have a sense of, or <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span> begin to become more fragmented, and I start to see, "Now I'm seeing the atomic reality of things." Am I? Is it the reality? Is it [[Ultimate Truth|the ultimate]] reality? Or is it just a <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> that tends to, because I look in a certain way, what appears to me is conditioned by, <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span> by, that <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Does Mahasi-style meditation on impermance disclose reality|?]] ^7-2

Yes, it's less [[Fabrication|fabricated]] than other [[Ways of looking]], or it <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricates</a></span> less than other <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>. Is it the end of [[fabrication]]? No. And certainly not is a state of [[mindfulness]] the end of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>, as I said before. It's like, "Ah, now there's no _[[Papanca|papañca]]_. There's no obsessing.

No. Keep open this question: what's the limit of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>? It seems real. Everyone seems to talk as if these things are real - bare sensations, or if I'm in a certain culture, the atomic process of [[mind]] moments and experiences. Is that [[Ultimate Truth|the ultimate]] reality? Or is that just a certain level of less <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>? So I keep this framework of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span> and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>, and I just see. Don't arrest that investigation. Keep playing. Is there a way that it, whatever I had taken to be the baseline of non-<span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>, is actually still <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span>? And I can learn to unfabricate that, too, whether it's a [[Awareness|vast awareness]], whether it's these momentary [[Impermanence|arisings and passings away]] of some impersonal process, whether it's just the sort of so-called '[[Attention|bare attention]]' to experiences. None of that is the end of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. All of those [[Perception|perceptions]] are still <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span>, and we can go deeper than that[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Bare sensations etc is not ultimate reality|.]] ^7-3

Now, if through contemplating rapid [[impermanence]] in [[meditation]] actually there is this pop that I described, or a kind of explosion, and one finds oneself suddenly - one doesn't find oneself; there's an explosion into the [[Unfabricated]], let's say, <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a></span>, then, again, why is that happening? Well, it happened because there was enough of a release of [[clinging]] in the contemplation of rapid <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, that the [[mind]] saw that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> and [[Letting go|just let go]], <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" href="Letting+go" class="internal-link">just let go</a></span>. And it's the [[letting go]] of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, because it unfabricates (because <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> [[Fabrication|fabricates]], so <span class="transcript"><a data-href="letting go" href="letting+go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> unfabricates). It's not the seeing the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> that reveals reality; it's seeing the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> that causes the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mind" href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> to let go of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> in this very subtle way. And _sometimes_ - sometimes this _doesn't_ happen; a person is just seeing <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> again and again, seeing <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> again and again - but sometimes it can release the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> at such a deep level that there is non-[[fabrication]] and there's an opening to the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Unfabricated" href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a></span>. But still, I need to _understand_ that. So if I'm not seeing it in terms of [[Ways of looking]], <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>, and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, I don't quite understand, as I said at the end of the first part, what is the relationship between this amazing <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Unfabricated" href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a></span> and this world of _[[dukkha]]_ and [[Perception|appearances]]. I need to understand something there[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#It's the resulting letting go of clinging that unfabricates not contemplating rapid impermance|.]] ^7-4
###### 8-1
So this way of approaching, what I've just described, this way of approaching the [[Insight|understanding]], the conception, conceiving of what [[Dharma|the path]] is, the aim of [[Clinging|non-clinging]], and approaching it in practice, it has the potential of really opening up something very radical, very radically, in [[experience]], in terms of this spectrum into depth and depths of [[Fabrication|lessening fabrication]] and unfabricating. All kinds of beautiful mystical experiences there possible, and an <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of the [[Unfabricated]] as well. Both in terms of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> a radicality, and also in terms of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>. So you might hear this, and hopefully it at least makes a little bit of sense, but without practice it's going to be like, "This is strange. I don't know what he's talking about. I don't know." It sounds, like, either baffling, or very far-fetched, or, "Well, it's not the kind of thing that I'm used to hearing." If I don't practise, I won't see this. And if I don't practise in certain ways that allow this and make this <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, I won't see this, I won't understand, and hearing about it certainly won't have much impact. Sometimes, as I said, even practising in certain ways doesn't have the impact, because I'm not conceiving of it in - even if there's this opening or that opening, or this <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, or that falling away or whatever, it doesn't have the right impact or the impact that it could have in terms of [[freedom]] and opening up the sense of existence, because I'm not conceiving it, I'm not framing it in a way that's actually helping it to do that[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#This needs practicing and right view|.]] ^8-1
###### 8-2
Maybe I'm limiting, as I said, my idea of, "This is [[Fabrication|fabricated]], and this is not <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span>." And I put a bottom limit to my exploration. Maybe I'm conceiving in terms of 'reality' rather than in terms of '[[Ways of looking]],' and that's creating a wall that I can't go beyond, or I'm not conceiving in terms of [[fabrication]] in a full enough way, or even at all[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Check if you conceive in terms of "reality" rather than in terms of "ways of looking|.]] ^8-2
###### 8-3
So this teaching, you know, the [[Buddha]]'s central teaching, the [[Four Noble Truths]] - there's _[[dukkha]],_ and it arises from [[clinging]], from [[craving]], as its cause, and there's the release of that, and there are ways to move towards releasing it; but the shorthand version, just <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>/<span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> cause _<span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>,_ and there's the possibility of releasing that - and the teaching of [[dependent origination]], which is a sort of more detailed explanation of that. An analogy for that is perhaps that we find ourselves - we don't know how we got there; we wake up and we're, somehow, we realize, locked in what seems to be the inside of some kind of dark, semi-dark (I don't know) big castle or something, and there are all these corridors and stairwells and doors, which some of them open and some of them are locked, and we don't know where we are and how on earth do we get out. And then we're given a map, maybe a map and one of those - I don't know what they're called - adjustable wrenches, you know? You can make it, depending on the bolt that you're trying to undo, make it larger, smaller. And then looking at the map, I try and decipher what's going on. I start to see: the door to get out, or the doors to get out, are on the ground floor, and I'm stuck on the third floor. So how do I even get down to the ground floor? Some doors are open. Other doors on the way to the ground floor, I need to unscrew them with my adjustable wrench, etc., and eventually, through all these things that I get, I find my way out. I find one of the doors, and I can unscrew that, and it actually leads to the fresh air, the daylight, the [[freedom]] of the outside. Completely different [[experience]][[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Simile Castle map and adjustable wrench|.]] ^8-3
###### 9-1
So the [[Buddha]]'s teaching of [[dependent origination]] is, if you like, a map, the map of the inside of that castle. I can locate myself, and then I can start moving in these ways. And the teachings about [[clinging]] are like that adjustable wrench. So I can actually undo the imprisonment. Okay? [laughs] I think that's not such a good analogy! It's a little too gothic. Yeah, there are lots of reasons why it's not such a good analogy - for a start, it turns out that the whole castle and imprisonment is a bit of an illusion. But anyway, the point is that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, the teaching of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> is a tool, and with skill we unlock something that has to do more with [[Insight|understanding]], <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> the [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]] of [[Perception|appearances]], the [[fabrication]] of the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span> of [[The Self|self, other, world, time]], space, etc., the [[emptiness]] of these things. Yeah, maybe it wasn't such a good analogy! Never [[mind]]. But the fact is that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, the teaching of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, is a tool, is a key[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Dependent origination is the map teachings on clinging the wrenches|.]] ^9-1
###### 9-2
The teaching "don't try to repeat experiences," it can be skilful at times. We can [[Clinging|cling]] and get too constricted to try and repeat experiences. But actually, in a way, we need to see this many times. We need to see this dependent [[fabrication]] and dependent [[Emptiness|fading]] many, many times, because it's such a deep level of [[Avijja|delusion]] that's entrenched there for us to believe in the reality of things: "Of course I, of course this object in front of me, of course this feeling, this sensation, or whatever it is, of course time, of course these are _real_ things. They exist independently of the [[mind]]." We need to see many, many times this <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a></span>, very specifically, through the release of [[craving]][[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#We need to see the fading many times|.]] ^9-2
###### 9-3
So it's not that we're [[Craving|grasping]] at experiences so much. It's that we want to repeat certain experiences, including the difficult ones - we don't need to repeat them intentionally, because we have them anyway, but we want to see our [[experience]] going up and down on this [[Fabrication|spectrum of fabrication]], dependent on [[clinging]]. See that many, many times, until it becomes, "Something in my heart knows the [[Emptiness|emptiness of all things]]." If I don't understand in _this_ sense, then the teaching "just [[Letting go|let go of everything]]," it won't be very deeply liberating. "Just <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" href="Letting+go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a></span>." I can hear that, and probably many people _do_ hear that, in a way that presumes a certain level of [[realism]], of the independent reality of what we're not <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to. So "<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" href="Letting+go" class="internal-link">just let go</a></span> of this or that," I _believe in_ this and that, and somehow I'm [[letting go]] of it. Or there's some level of reality that remains. I can see that there's some construction, some [[fabrication]], but there's some level of reality - maybe that atomistic [[reductionism]], "There's just this process of events, of [[consciousness]] and [[perception]] and _[[Vedana|vedanā]]_ and all that" - and that level of reality remains. And then you get teachings which conflate [[impermanence]] and [[emptiness]]. In that way of limited [[Insight|understanding]], just to say that [[the self]] is empty means there's nothing but [[Impermanence|impermanent]] moments, or you could say that of anything. But <span class="transcript"><a data-href="emptiness" href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> is saying something much deeper than <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, much more radical[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#"Just let go of everything" might still assume the reality of what to let go of|.]] ^9-3
###### 9-4
Or again, we might say, "Oh, just [[Letting go|let go of everything]], just being and just receiving. When I'm doing that, I'm not engaging a [[Ways of looking|way of looking]]; I'm just receiving purely. I'm just being. I'm not trying. I'm not doing any <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>." Oftentimes people hear about this <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>: "Oh, that's interesting. Interesting.

There's _always_ a <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. So if we don't understand this teaching deeply enough, some level of [[realism]] (which is basically [[Avijja|delusion]], _[[Ignorance|avijjā]]_) remains, and then we believe in things like the atomistic [[reductionism]] [[perception]], or we believe that I can do something called 'just being,' and that that's 'not doing,' or that I can 'just receive' or whatever, I can somehow have a mode of being that has no <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#"Just being and receiving" is still a way of looking|.]] ^9-4
###### 10-1
So somehow I have to pick up this teaching of [[Clinging|non-clinging]], of [[letting go]], of what it means to [[Letting go|let go of everything]] - I have to approach it in a certain way. I'm not trying to live without [[clinging]]. I'm trying to use the teaching of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]] and [[fabrication]] and [[Ways of looking]] (all of which are intimately linked with each other), and that functions as this adjustable wrench and map, this tool, key, if you like, to unlock something. Actually, I can't live without <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, because - this is curious now, and again, without the [[experience]] of this, and without [[Insight|understanding]] a certain way, this is going to sound bizarre, but I can't live without <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, because <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> is a part of perceiving/experiencing anything. As I said, it's part of [[attention]]. And when I really let go of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> very deeply, in that moment, [[Perception|appearances]] do not appear. There is no [[perception]][[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#I cannot live without clinging because it is a part of perceiving|.]] ^10-1
###### 10-2
If I really '[[Letting go|just let go]]' of everything, the world does not appear. [[The Self|Self, world, time]] do not appear. So this is interesting. And I don't know if people [are aware of this]; it seems to me most people are _not_ aware of this, but this actually caused a huge conundrum in the [[history]] of [[Buddhism]]. How does an [[Awakening|arahant]] and how does a [[Buddha]], fully <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightened</a></span>, therefore supposedly no _[[Ignorance|avijjā]]_, no [[craving]], how do they perceive anything? If [[perception]] is part of the fourth link of [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]], what's called _nāmarūpa_, and if there's no _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_ and there's no <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, then actually <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> does not arise. You can [[experience]] that in [[meditation]], and know it for a fact in <span class="transcript"><a data-href="meditation" href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>. So someone says, "Well, the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" href="Awakening" class="internal-link">arahant</a></span> or a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Buddha" href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> has a residual amount of kind of karmic momentum that enables them to have [[Perception|appearances]], etc., but at their [[death]], their final _nirvāṇa_, that is dissolved, and so they're not reborn again." In other words, the world of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> is not reborn for them. There's total [[Unfabricated|unbinding]] of the world of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#If I really let go of everything self world time do not appear|.]] ^10-2
###### 10-3
When it came to the [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]], historically, a few hundred years after the [[Buddha]]'s [[death]], even _that_ explanation was a problem for a number of reasons. If a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Buddha" href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> was devoted to, even though they were completely free, completely devoid of [[Avijja|delusion]], if they were devoted to [[Perception|appearing]] again and again, being reborn to serve [[Dukkha|suffering]] beings out of [[compassion]], to help people, how is it that they could have <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span>? They have no _[[Ignorance|avijjā]]_. They have no [[craving]]. _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">Avijjā</a></span>_ and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>/[[clinging]] are needed for the [[fabrication]] of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span>. So you get this very strange sort of basis for ... that's not the right way of saying it, but from a certain perspective, that was the basis for a whole complex elaboration of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a></span> philosophy. I don't think it's that simple, because I think the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a></span> had lots of [[Insight|insights]] that weren't just trying to fudge an explanation of how a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Buddha" href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> could come back, because in the [[Theravada|Theravāda]], once a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Buddha" href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s gone, they're gone.

###### 10-4
In the [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] teaching, there's actually a teaching that most people respect that says only a [[Buddha]] - not even an [[Awakening|arahant]], but only a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Buddha" href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> - can contemplate the full [[Emptiness|emptiness of things]] and have [[Perception|appearances]] at the same time.^[E.g. in the _Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra_ and the _Mahāyānasaṃgraha._ See also Rob Burbea, _Seeing That Frees: Meditations on Emptiness and Dependent Arising_ (Devon: Hermes Amāra, 2014), 402] As I explained in the practices, for someone who's not a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Buddha" href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> (which includes an <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" href="Awakening" class="internal-link">arahant</a></span>), when they, if you like, lean heavily - in attending to something, whatever it is: a sensation, a [[perception]] - in the very attending to that object, they're leaning, if you like, or they're using a [[Ways of looking|way of looking]] that also knows thoroughly the [[emptiness]] of that object, then that object fades. So either everything fades when they fully contemplate <span class="transcript"><a data-href="emptiness" href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, or they have to kind of go into a mode where they're not actually leaning so much on that [[insight]] of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="emptiness" href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. And, if you like, this residual _[[Ignorance|avijjā]]_, this kind of default _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_, is reasserting itself so that they can have <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span>.

This can seem like a very strange, abstruse, abstract [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] teaching, but there's a reason, if you're following all this. There's a reason for it, reasons. And then one way of conceiving of what [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] practice is, [[Tantra|tantric]] practice is, is it's kind of, if you like - and I use this word in a positive sense - 'faking' a [[Buddha]]-[[mind]], so that we're kind of allowing our [[insight]] of the [[emptiness]] of whatever it is we're perceiving, we're allowing that to pervade the [[Ways of looking|way of looking]], but in a lighter way, so that this object that I'm looking at becomes _relatively_ transparent, and I _know_ its <span class="transcript"><a data-href="emptiness" href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, but I'm not leaning on that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> into <span class="transcript"><a data-href="emptiness" href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> so much that it actually fades. So I'm kind of playing with walking a tightrope of keeping [[Perception|appearances]] around, but seeing them, knowing them as empty. If I lean on that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> too much (of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="emptiness" href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> as I'm looking at this object) - I'm not going away from the object; I'm looking at it, but knowing its <span class="transcript"><a data-href="emptiness" href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> - that object will [[Emptiness|fade]]. There's much more to it involved, and we're going to come back to this, but <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tantra" data-href="Tantra" href="Tantra" class="internal-link">tantric</a></span> practice, one of the aspects that's involved is this kind of faking of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Buddha" href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>-<span class="transcript"><a data-href="mind" href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> that can actually fully know the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="emptiness" href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> _and_ have the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a></span>. We will return to this. But the point is, I cannot live without [[clinging]], because <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> is part of [[perception]]. [[Clinging]] is necessary for <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>.

On top of that, [[clinging]] is empty too. [[Clinging]] has no inherent existence. And again, this is something that's really emphasized by all the great [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] teachers: [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]], [[Chandrakirti|Chandrakīrti]], you name it. So they say there's no grasper to be found, [[Anatta|no self]] [[Craving|grasping]]. There is no object of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> to be found, neither is <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> to be found. All these are empty, all these are void, all these are illusory - pick your words. There are countless instances of these statements. No grasper, no grasped, no <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>. No clinger, no clung to, no <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. They are empty. They are illusory. So you put all this together, and you start to have a different [[Insight|understanding]] of the whole thing. It starts to open up in different possibilities, and certainly a different level of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>. We can say: don't <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a></span> to <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" href="Clinging" class="internal-link">non-clinging</a></span>.

Don't <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a></span> to the idea of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" href="Clinging" class="internal-link">non-clinging</a></span>. So this is strange now. There is space for <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. Because I know it's empty, because I know it's part of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, part of the magic of [[Perception|appearances]], there's space for <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Clinging" href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a></span> is given permission, if you like[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#No clinger no clung to no clinging|.]] ^11-2

So "achieved is the end of [[craving]]"^[Dhp 154] doesn't mean that I'm living in some way without <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. What would that mean, if <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> is part of [[perception]]? Doesn't mean that. It means seen and understood is this relationship between <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, [[clinging]], [[fabrication]], and the lessening of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, and the lessening of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>, and the, if you like, dissolution of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> temporarily, and the opening into the [[Unfabricated]]. And all this implies, as I said, the [[emptiness]] of everything - of [[the self]], of the [[mind]], of [[consciousness]], [[awareness]] (whatever word you want to use for it), of objects, of world, of space, of time, of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. Everything empty, [[Fabrication|fabricated]], illusory. Actually, can go even beyond _that_ level of [[Insight|understanding]][[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#"End of craving" does not mean that I am living in some way without craving|.]] ^11-3
###### 12-1
Something happens in approaching it this way, and seeing it this way, and [[Insight|understanding]] something, that opens up the sense of existence. [[Mystical opening]] of the whole sense of existence. Radically different sense. I'm no longer being in this world that seems pretty real and attempting to try and live without [[clinging]]. Free to [[Craving|crave]], free to play with different degrees of [[craving]] in my [[Ways of looking]], free to [[Fabrication|fabricate]] more or less. Skill here - art actually, art. Free to engage the art of [[fabrication]], to let it go completely quiet, to <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricate</a></span> in different ways, to different degrees. This becomes part of the practice, because I understand something. I can <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricate</a></span> a little, I can <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricate</a></span> a lot, can go into the [[Unfabricated]]. Then, what we might call 'simple [[mindfulness]]' or '[[Attention|bare attention]],' and the [[experience]] of the vividness of things and the simplicity of things, and sometimes what people call the '[[Emptiness#Suchness|suchness]]' of things, when it just feels like, "I'm just so present. Everything is so bright. It just _is_ what it _is_ ..." Incidentally, that word, '<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness > Suchness" data-href="Emptiness#Suchness" href="Emptiness#Suchness" class="internal-link">suchness</a></span>,' actually means completely the opposite of that in the tradition. It means the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of things</a></span>, that they are not what they appear to be. They are _exactly not_ what they appear to be: 'just this,' 'just that,' 'exactly as it is.' '<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness > Suchness" data-href="Emptiness#Suchness" href="Emptiness#Suchness" class="internal-link">Suchness</a></span>' means '[[emptiness]],' means their lack of inherent existence, means that they are not anything in particular. They are <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span>. They are illusory. They are not 'like this' or 'like that.' Strange reversal of meaning that's happened historically, especially in the West. There are different reasons for that, but I won't go into that now[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#I'm free to play with different degress of craving in may ways of looking; misunderstanding "suchness"|.]] ^12-1
###### 12-2
But that state of [[mind]], and that level of [[experience]] of what we call [[mindfulness]] or [[Attention|bare attention]], the vividness that comes with that, and the [[beauty]] that comes with that, that's just a certain level of less [[fabrication]] than normal. If I'm hanging out in what some people call [[Awareness|Big Mind]], or <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awareness" data-href="Awareness" href="Awareness" class="internal-link">vast awareness</a></span>, or whatever, that, too, it's one degree of less <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. But it's still [[Fabrication|fabricated]] in a certain direction, this beautiful vastness, <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awareness" data-href="Awareness" href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Big Mind</a></span>, everything just arising out of that vastness, disappearing back into it. Lovely, mystical state. It's one degree of less <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. It's a certain direction of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. Or if I'm seeing this rapid [[impermanence]], this atomistic process arising, passing, arising, passing, again, it's just one degree, it's a certain degree of less <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>, and in a certain direction, <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricating</a></span> according to the [[Ways of looking|way of looking]], just like the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awareness" data-href="Awareness" href="Awareness" class="internal-link">vast awareness</a></span>[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#States of mind and experiences are just ways of looking|.]] ^12-2
###### 12-3
And I can go much deeper, states of much less [[fabrication]], much deeper unfabricating than either of those, either the [[Awareness|vast awareness]] or this atomistic process. Much deeper. But even the really deep unfabrication - some of you might have heard of the formless _[[Jhanas|jhānas]]._ These are available experiences: the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">realm of nothingness</a></span>, the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">realm of neither perception nor non-perception</a></span>, the seventh and the eighth _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhānas</a></span>_, these deep states of unfabricating, of less <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. And even beyond that, as I said, to the [[Unfabricated]], <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a></span>, <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unborn</a></span>, <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Deathless</a></span>. And what happens, as I said, is then I can [[Fabrication|fabricate]] all these different directions, and many more - actually infinite possibilities of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>, many, many more than that, in different directions and different degrees, and the whole art of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>, if you like, and that spectrum opens up for me, and the directions of artful <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> open up as practice, as play.

So living without [[clinging]] is not the point of the [[Dharma]]. But [[Insight|understanding]], seeing the [[dependent origination]], the dependent [[Emptiness|fading]], the [[fabrication]], the dependent <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>, dependent on <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, and through that, seeing the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of things</a></span> - these are interchangeable; means the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of all things</a></span>. This is the point of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, and it opens so much up. Actually, even this teaching of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="dependent origination" href="dependent+origination" class="internal-link">dependent origination</a></span>, all those links, we start to understand, in a way, that that very teaching starts to melt itself. Those links, they melt, they overlap, they blur, they <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span>. We see they're not real things either. Again, [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]], others - the [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] made this very clear: all [[Dependent Origination|twelve links of dependent origination]] are illusions. They're ifabricated. They're empty. They're not real. Again, choose your lingo. You can find many, many instances of that, absolutely insisted upon. The teaching of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="dependent origination" href="dependent+origination" class="internal-link">dependent origination</a></span>, the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" href="Dependent+Origination" class="internal-link">twelve links</a></span>, this is not a reality. This is a tool. This is a key that then dissolves itself. Dissolves, melts itself, that whole link, in _[[experience]]_, as we open to the [[Unfabricated]], but also in _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>,_ because we understand that these are not real things. We're not talking about separate things. We're not talking about elements, real elements or components of a real process here. This was an incredible skill of the [[Buddha]], finding concepts that we can pick up and use as [[Ways of looking]], and if we approach it in that spirit, we begin to see that the very <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span> lead to other <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>. The whole thing kind of dissolves itself and opens up a [[freedom]] of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, but also a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="freedom" href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, what comes with <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#The links of dependent origination are not real either|.]] ^12-4

Okay. So we can hear teachings and assume that what we're hearing, or conclude from what we're hearing or reading, or in some instances we're actually _taught_ that the [[Dharma]] is, the point is, the aim is, "Try to be in the world without [[craving]] or without [[clinging]]. Be kind. But because everything's [[Impermanence|impermanent]], try to be in the world without <span class="transcript"><a data-href="craving" href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, without <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, and you will suffer less." Obviously there's some truth to that. But what if we understand the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> and approach it and these teachings of [[dependent origination]], dependent [[Emptiness|fading]], [[fabrication]], [[Ways of looking]], [[Four Noble Truths]], <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, all that, as keys that unlock, that unbind the apparent [[nature]] of reality and reveal everything as empty, reveal the world as empty, as magical illusion, and _that's_ the point of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>? And what that then _allows_ for us becomes the point and the aim of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>. Because then, as I said, we can shape [[perception]]. We can [[Fabrication|fabricate]] in different ways. This self is empty. I know that thoroughly. There is no [[The Self|self-view]] at all - not process, not atoms, not [[Awareness|big awareness]], not nothing - any <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" href="The+Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span> is empty, is a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fabrication" href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. I can, therefore, shape this empty self in different ways. I can <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricate</a></span> different kinds of selves, <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricate</a></span> different kinds of [[Perception|appearances]] of the world, of others, all kinds of things, of time, through the art of practice. And there's a huge range there[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Any appearing is empty so I can shape this appearing in different ways|.]] ^13-1
###### 13-2
And the selves that I know are illusory, that I know are [[Fabrication|fabrications]], that I <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricate</a></span> deliberately and skilfully as arts, they don't have to be [[Constriction|constrained]] to look a certain way: "I always have to look calm, especially as I'm a [[meditation]] teacher." [laughs] Or I'm a Buddhist. I don't always have to look unexcited. That's a certain [[fabrication]] of self. If I know it's illusory, well, there's a lot more room to play with. There's a lot more dressing up, a lot more garments to try on, to have fun in the magic clothes shop changing room, if you remember _Mr Benn_ from English TV. [laughs] You have to be a certain age! So this is really, to me, it's really important, and it makes a huge difference to what we even consider the [[Dharma]] is or where we're going[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#If I know it's illusionary then there is more room to play with|.]] ^13-2
###### 13-3
Actually, I'll just throw one more thing. Just to point out, in addition to all this, that most [[letting go]], most [[Clinging|non-clinging]], involves actually another object of [[clinging]]. And there's no problem with this; it's just, almost inevitably, it's how we don't <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a></span>. People say, "[[Letting go|Just let go]]. <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" href="Letting+go" class="internal-link">Just let go</a></span>," as if we do that independently of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to something else. So - I don't know - someone who's addicted to alcohol or drugs or something like that, you know, talk to someone who's been through that and come out the other end. They didn't <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" href="Letting+go" class="internal-link">just let go</a></span>. There was a process there where they actually clung, and sometimes for dear life, they clung to something that was more [[Kusala|wholesome]]. Maybe they clung to a certain ethical - the fifth precept or whatever, through the support of the [[Sangha|Saṅgha]]. They clung to their _[[Sila|sīla]]._ Maybe the fellowship, a twelve step fellowship. Maybe even they took on the identity, "Hello, my name is X, and I am an addict. I am an alcoholic," and that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to a certain identity was absolutely necessary in <span class="transcript"><a data-href="letting go" href="letting+go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> of the addiction[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Cling to something more wholesome Twelve Steps|.]] ^13-3

Or in [[Buddhism]] (whether it's secularly conceived or whether it's religiously conceived) and all kinds of other religions, actually a person is able to let go because effectively they're [[clinging]] to a [[Devotion|faith]], some <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a></span> in something or other, again, whether that's a secularly conceived <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a></span> or a religiously conceived <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a></span>.

Even those examples from practice that I described earlier in this talk - in this _[[Anatta|anattā]]_ [[Ways of looking|way of looking]], that incredible depth and [[beauty]] of [[letting go]] is allowed because, effectively or realistically, I'm <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to the view, the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, of _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_.

There's certainly a <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> there, replete with all kinds of subtle [[Conceptual framework|conceptuality]], and a certain relationship with things, a certain mode, replete with doing. Please don't think that that state - it's _relatively_ less doing; it still involves doing. But I'm effectively [[clinging]] to that doing and that conception and that <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" href="Ways+of+looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, and that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> enables <span class="transcript"><a data-href="letting go" href="letting+go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span>. I think it was one of my teachers teacher's teacher, I think, _[[Ajahn Dhammadharo|Ajaan Dhammadaro]]_, a Thai monk. I'm not sure when he died. He died quite young in Thailand, a Forest monk in Thailand. I think it was him that used this analogy of it's like a ladder. The [[Dharma]] and practice is like a ladder. When you're climbing a ladder, for your feet to let go of the bottom rung, first I need to put my feet on the bottom rung, then to let go of the bottom rung my hands grip another rung, or my one foot, if you like, grips or finds a basis in the next rung. My hands, probably, unless I'm trying to do it without hands, something's gripping something, if you like, higher, or more subtle. And in this way we go[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Simile Climing the rungs of a ladder|.]] ^14-2

If we take the addiction example, [[clinging]] to _[[Sila|sīla]]_ is a more refined <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> than <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to alcohol. [[Clinging]] to _[[Anatta|anattā]]_ is a much more refined <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> than <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to [[The Self|self-view]] ("this is me, this is mine," in its even unconscious way). And then even <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to the view of _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_, even <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to the view of [[emptiness]]. So the process of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" href="Clinging" class="internal-link">non-clinging</a></span> develops through <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to something else. We don't [[Letting go|just let go]]. Again, we're so attracted by the simplicity, the seeming simplicity of that statement, but like with a ladder, eventually you reach the last rung, and you can let go, you can let go of the ladder, or the [[Buddha]]'s analogy of the raft crossing the stream, the river, whatever it is. You can let go of the ladder, the raft[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#The process of non-clinging dvelops through clinging to something else|.]] ^14-3

But it happens progressively, at more and more subtle levels. If I don't have a [[Ways of looking|way of looking]] and ways of [[clinging]] to more subtle things, this idea of "just [[Letting go|let go of everything]]," it really is pretty silly, and we'll just end up either with complete frustration, or blindness to what I'm <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to, or just this kind of like, "Oh, well. What are you going to do? It's hard. Maybe the real masters somewhere living in some caves can do something, but basically the rest of us have just to put up with our [[Avijja|delusion]] and our <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>." And we try and let go of the grosser [[Clinging|clingings]], and we laugh at ourselves, etc. But much more is possible[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Much more is possible than "just let go of everything"|.]] ^14-4

So it doesn't make sense, as I said, to live without [[craving]] or [[clinging]], because it's involved in the [[fabrication]] of [[perception]]. It's involved in experiencing anything. But as I said at the beginning of the last talk, there's a second problem with this ideal of living without <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, in addition to what I've said in this talk. There's a second problem: would we even, really, deep down, want to? So not to do with [[Avijja|delusion]], but is it what really the depths of the heart and the being want? What would it even look like, really? So this is what I want to explore a little bit[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Would would we even really deep down want to|.]] ^15-1
