Okay, so how might we think about this teaching about [[clinging]] and [[dukkha]], how might we conceive of it and this aim of non-clinging, how might we conceive of that and approach it in practice in ways that do open up the full depth of what is possible and do not constrain the breadth of [[beauty]] and possibility for us in our lives? What are the ways, what are the possibilities of conceiving and approaching in practice this area, this theme of the teaching? ^1-1
###### 1-2
So there is a few ways into this we could go, but let me try and say something briefly about it. ^1-2
###### 1-3
One possibility is to take up this theme, not to actually wait until we are in the grip of some obsessive [[contraction]] of [[clinging]] around something or other and then try and let go of that - important as that is, to address those kind of states of mind and states of being when they arise and how can we find some relief, how can we see in a different way. But actually to take up this theme of clinging and [[craving]] as a theme and to run with it even when it seems like there is not much craving going on. So for example, in sitting or [[Meditation|walking meditation]], standing meditation or whatever, we can actually, as I mentioned in the last talk, in the first part of this talk, begin to get familiar and more and more sensitivity to the [[experience]] of craving and clinging, this experience of something contracting in the mind and the body. Even when there is no thought there, something's contracting towards a sensation, towards an idea, towards an [[image]], away from. So it could be, again, grasping at something or pushing something away, grasping or [[aversion]]. ^1-3
###### 1-4
This subtle feeling, we get more and more familiar with, and we notice this is [[dukkha]]. This [[contraction]] itself feels unpleasant. As I said, it might be much subtler than even noticeable in the musculature. We are talking about just the sense of the subtle body, the [[energy body]], the sense of the space of the mind. Feeling it, feeling its dukkha. We are talking about subtle dukkha now. Feeling that subtle dukkha and relaxing, relaxing the subtle body, relaxing the [[energy]], relaxing that tension that is come in with that grasping of [[clinging]], [[craving]]. Releasing it. So actually working directly with the energy of that contraction and releasing the contraction. Now, you could, as I said in the first part, you could think about the object, you could contemplate its [[impermanence]], et cetera, or you can work directly with the actual energetics of clinging and craving. So that is just an alternative way. ^1-4
###### 1-5
If you start doing this and you start actually getting quite skilled, there is an art in this, and you start to develop a sensitivity, as I said, it gets more subtle, because when I let go of, when I release a certain amount of [[craving]], [[Steadiness|calmness]] comes into the being, the body, the mind. There is an openness. There is a calmness. And that calmness, like when the water is calm in a pond or a lake or something, I can actually pick up even more subtle levels of craving. So then I can feel that, very subtle, and release those, and even more calm. So the very calmness that is made possible through the release, again and again, finding some craving, releasing it, finding some craving, releasing it, the calmness that can open up through that actually allows me to go deeper, more subtle into the process. ^1-5
###### 1-6
So this is actually a very enjoyable process. Most people who work that way in practice, it is a certain way of working, it is a very, very lovely way to practice.^[Das ist eine Fu√ünote] Very lovely. All kinds of [[beauty]] and softening and ease comes in. We start to notice something. First thing is, ah, yes, when I let go of the [[craving]], the [[dukkha]] releases. So we could say the dukkha is being [[Fabrication|fabricated]] by the craving. Okay? I feel viscerally, in my felt [[experience]], again and again, I just see: craving, dukkha, craving, dukkha, and I feel it, I feel its tension, and I feel the ease, the relief of the dukkha right there. Dukkha here means something again really quite broad in its range, really from quite gross to really, really quite subtle. ^1-6
###### 1-7
But as I develop this practice and work with it and enjoy it and develop my sensitivity and the art of it, I also start to realize that the [[The Self|sense of self]] is also [[Fabrication|fabricated]] with and by the [[craving]]. In other words, the more craving, the more solid the sense of self, the more [[Contraction|contracted]], the more separate from others or from the world. So this sense of self, I start to see it, like the [[dukkha]], move up and down on a spectrum of fabrication. Sometimes it is so solid, so dense, so separate. And when I let go of craving, and when I let go at the deeper end of this spectrum, the whole sense of self gets much lighter, much more transparent, much more melted, much less well-defined its edges, melts into a kind of [[oneness]], et cetera, or begins to dissolve in different ways. ^1-7
###### 2-1
And then correspondingly there is a mutual dependence the other way: the stronger the [[The Self|sense of self]], the more that tends to build [[craving]], unless we come in and work with it this other way by releasing. But the sense of self, the [[experience]] of [[dukkha]] and the experience of self are dependent on craving. More craving, more self, if you like. Less craving, less self gets [[Fabrication|fabricated]]. Very interesting. It does not stop there, either, because as I develop this practice and I enjoy it and I get into it and I feel the yumminess of it, I start to see not just dukkha, not just the sense of my self in the moment, but also the sense of the very objects that I am paying [[attention]] to and the sense of the very world that I feel myself to be in, that, too, gets correspondingly more solid, more separate, more of an issue, more prominent in [[consciousness]] to the degree that I am craving. More craving, more solid and more dense and more real, if you like, the world becomes, the more oppressive. Let go of craving, let go a deeper level, start to see these dependencies, start to see objects, too, begin to [[Emptiness|fade]] out, they begin to melt, they begin to blur. The very [[perception]] of objects, the very perception of the world, is also dependent on craving to a certain extent. ^2-1
###### 2-2
Now, people can, some people, this practice really works and can take you very, very deep; other people it sort of comes to a limit and they have to slightly change the practice or move to something else. But basically one way of [[Insight|understanding]] what is happening there is that we are, at any moment in time, always inevitably engaging what I would call a [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]]. That is a shorthand phrase. What it really means is a way of looking, a way of perceiving, a way of relating, and a way of conceiving. I use this word conceiving not just to mean thinking about. Even when I am not thinking, I am still conceiving, I am still vaguely feeling there is a me and an it; there is a self, a subject, and an object, and it is happening in time; even if it is just this [[present moment]], nothing else going on but the [[consciousness]] and the object and a present moment, that is still conception. I have got the tripod there of subject, object, time. There is still conception. ^2-2
###### 2-3
So I use this word conceiving to mean something much, much deeper and more pervasive and more subtle than thinking, but it also includes thinking. So a [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] is the way of, wrapped up, all together, in any moment, the way of relating, the way of perceiving, seeing, sensing, and the way of conceiving. All that together, just for shorthand, [[Passion|calling]] a way of looking. And in any moment, there is always a way of looking. There is always a way of looking. Now, that way of looking might have a lot of [[clinging]] in, or it might have less clinging, or it might have really a little clinging, or it might have really, really, really a tiny, only the subtlest clinging. But always at some moment, the mind, the being, is somewhere on that spectrum of how much clinging and what kinds of clinging are going on in the way of looking. ^2-3
###### 2-4
And I start to see, I start to make connections here. Dependent on the [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]], including how much and what kind of [[clinging]] is going on, dependent on that is my [[experience]]. Experience of [[dukkha]], certainly. [[The Self|Experience of self]] as well. And experience of the object that I am paying [[attention]] to, the objects and the world around me. Also the experience of time. All kinds of things. More clinging, more [[fabrication]] of dukkha, of self, of objects, of world. Less clinging, less fabrication. So there is, as I said here, a spectrum of subtlety. It gets extremely subtle, and as we all know, it can be very, very gross, the level of clinging and the solidity that comes into all these experiences of dukkha, of self, of other, of world. ^2-4
###### 2-5
So when you start to explore this way, apart from the loveliness of this practice, uncovering more subtle levels of [[dukkha]] is actually - contrary to what it might sound at first, like, "Oh, that is horrific, the sort of excavation of more and more dukkha, more and more [[clinging]], suffering," no. ^2-5
###### 3-1
Because I am feeling the [[dukkha]], I am releasing it, I am finding ways to release, it actually feels very beautiful. There is great [[beauty]], great, as I said, yumminess really in this practice. Really, really lovely way of practicing. As I start to do this, the whole distinction between words like [[clinging]] and [[craving]] also starts to melt. It is okay, it is valid at a certain level, but actually it is not really getting to the really juicy stuff. It is not really opening things out in a very deep way, to hang on, to cling, in effect, to a distinction between craving and clinging, for instance. ^3-1
###### 3-2
When I start to see - I am just picking this one way of practicing as a way in; could pick another one - but I start to see the [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]] and the [[fabrication]] of my entire [[experience]], but let us just say, for now, just of self (but also of objects, as I said). The dependent arising. They arise dependent on the [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]], dependent on the mind, and dependent essentially on the [[clinging]]. The fabrication - if we say the same thing in other words - of the [[The Self|sense of self]], the fabrication of the [[Perception|appearances]] of things and of objects and of time and of world and all of that, dependent on clinging. And I start to understand what does it mean to say that the self is empty, what does it mean to say that appearances appear but they are empty, they are dependent arisings, they are fabrications, they are illusory, they do not exist. This self sense that seems so real, this object sense that seems so real, this thing before me, this thing in my mind, this emotion, whatever it is, seems so real; it is a dependent arising, a fabricated illusion. It is not a thing in itself without the mind clinging at it or to it. ^3-2
###### 3-3
I start to understand, probably start to see it first more easily with [[the self]], but it can happen different ways, and then maybe that leads to another kind of practice. Maybe I see a certain amount of the [[fabrication]] of the self, the [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]], the [[emptiness]] of the self through this developed art of [[letting go]] of [[clinging]] and [[craving]], and I start to kind of have a conviction, yeah, this self is an illusion. And so when it feels like I am looking at something and I see, oh, that is me, it is me, I am this mind or I am this [[consciousness]] or that is my body or this is my emotion or whatever, I start to see that is kind of an illusion, because I have seen this whole self is a construction, a concoction, a fabrication. It is a [[sankhara]], in the [[Buddha]]'s words. Then maybe I can move to another kind of practice which is let me just dwell, in my [[Meditation|sitting meditation]], in my walking meditation, my standing meditation, and just whatever arises I am regarding it as [[anatta]]. Atta means self in Pali; anatta means not-self. This is not-self, it is not me, it is not mine. ^3-3
###### 3-4
So this becomes a [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]]. Some people can just move straight into that practice. Other people need to do another practice that enables it a little bit. At some point I could, if I want, change practices and move into that. It is another way of looking. I am regarding whatever comes up as [[anatta]]. Whatever comes up is not-self, not me, not mine. This is not a big, laborious thinking process. It is a way of looking; it is immediate. It is something that is permeating my very perceiving. It is a conception, for sure, but it is also a cutting or replacing of the usual unconscious conception, which is "this is me, this is mine." We do not often think that, but we have a sense. I look at my hand, it is my hand. It is not yours, it is mine. A memory comes up, it is mine. I do not even have to think this, but that conception is operating naturally. So we are just kind of letting that more usual conception go away and replacing it with another conception, not me, not mine. That becomes the way of looking. ^3-4
###### 3-5
And again, this can be extremely powerful. Beautiful, beautiful practice to develop as an art, and there is lots to it. Like any practice, it has lots of subtleties and nuts and bolts; you need to learn how to navigate it and stuff. You can really develop it. Very, very beautiful. What will happen? Something similar to what we described in that practice of releasing [[craving]]: the world of [[Perception|appearances]], the [[The Self|sense of self]], the world of objects, even as I pay [[attention]] to them, they [[Emptiness|fade]]. Not because they are [[Impermanence|impermanent]]. Because I am releasing the [[clinging]]. I am releasing the clinging and I see, oh, they fade. I do not necessarily move to this fast, momentary impermanence (I will come back to that in a second, the sense of rapid impermanence). They fade in the sense that they blur, they dissolve, they fade into white light or into blackness or whatever. They disappear. ^3-5
###### 3-6
So, for instance, paying [[attention]] to, again, a [[pain]] in my back or in my knees or whatever, and "[[anatta]], anatta, anatta," and maybe even the [[consciousness]] that knows this [[vedana]], this unpleasant vedana, it is also anatta, anatta. I develop that skill. Takes time. Really an art to develop here and in stages usually. I have talked about it elsewhere; I am going very quickly now. And it is not that then I then see this rapid [[impermanence]] of vedana. No, I actually see that unpleasant vedana will - not trying to [[Aversion|push it away]] with this anatta [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]], but it is almost like it does not matter; I have let go of the [[clinging]] of the believing it is me or mine, and the vedana itself first goes towards - actually it might go towards pleasant, funnily enough, but eventually it goes towards neutrality. What was unpleasant either loses its unpleasantness more and more, and may go through a stage of being actually pleasant, but eventually if I keep doing it, keep doing it even on the pleasant vedana, it becomes neutral. And then eventually even those neutral sensations disappear. There is no sensation there in the knee anymore. I am staring right at it. It is not that I am not paying attention. I am certainly not distracted. It is faded. It is [[unfabricated]]. And I start to see, again, dependent on the way of looking is the construction of my [[experience]], my [[perception]], and what appears to me. ^3-6
###### 4-1
And this practice can go really deep, the [[anatta]], in terms of how much it can deconstruct or unfabricate the world of [[Perception|appearances]]. And then again, based on that practice, maybe I really start to have a conviction, because I see it again and again, I start to see whatever appears - whether I take it as me or mine or whatever - it is empty. Not just that it is not me and it is not mine, but it is in itself empty. It is an illusory appearance, to borrow the [[Buddha]]'s terminology. It is a [[fabrication]]. It is a concoction. It is a construction, construction dependent on the [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]]. If I look in a certain way, the world appears and it appears very solid. If I look in other ways, it appears but it appears much less solid. And if I look in certain ways, certain ways of looking, if I pay [[attention]] in certain ways of looking, it does not appear. This thing that was troubling me, this thing that I loved, this thing that was neutral, fades. ^4-1
###### 4-2
And this undermines, when I see this again and again, it begins to undermine, make the connections, begins to undermine my belief in the reality of things, the reality of experiences, at any level. And we are talking the atomic components of [[experience]], very rapid, the reality of anything at all, I cannot believe that they have an independent reality, independent of the [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]]. That belief that they do have an independent reality is the most fundamental level of [[Ignorance|avijja]], of [[Avijja|delusion]]. And so in the tradition, picked up especially in the [[Mahayana]] tradition, [[clinging]], this word clinging, has a much broader range of meaning than just the kind of gross obsession, et cetera, hanging onto something for grim life. Just the belief that something has a reality independent of the way of looking, independent of the mind, if you like, just that belief. And again, we do not walk around thinking about this; this is how we tend to see, how we tend to view, how we tend to experience. It is the default way of looking at a very deep level. That belief, that avijja, is clinging. So that avijja, this basic level of delusion, of ignorance, is a form of clinging. Avijja is grouped together with other forms of clinging. ^4-2
###### 4-3
And then I can start to actually employ another [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]], through the development of these arts, these practices, when this [[Insight|understanding]], when I have conviction in my heart that something in me knows, I have seen them [[Emptiness|fade]] dependent on the way of looking, and I see how [[clinging]] and [[The Self|self-view]] constructs the [[fabrication]], fabricates objects, constructs the [[Perception|appearances]] of seemingly solid, separate things. When I have seen that enough, something in my heart is convinced, and I can adopt deliberately, play with, entertain a way of looking in practice, in whatever posture in practice, that just sees things and the way of looking says empty, empty, empty - meaning I know; I do not have to have this shorthand whole thinking thing. Again, it is very fluid, very direct, very light way of looking: I know you are empty. I have seen. I know you are empty because I know that you fade when the way of looking has less [[Ignorance|avijja]] in it, when there is less clinging to the self-view, when I see you as [[Anatta|not-self]], or whatever it is. ^4-3
###### 4-4
So I can start to look at things and just see them as empty, empty, empty. What happens then? ^4-4
###### 4-5
An even deeper level of [[Emptiness|fading]]. And this applies to everything without question. The barest sense of subject, just a sense of [[consciousness]], a momentary consciousness or a vast, eternal-seeming [[awareness]]. Empty, [[fabrication]]. Much less fabricated than our normal sense of consciousness or awareness, but still a fabrication, empty. The [[present moment]], however brief that seems or eternal that seems, fabrication, empty. Whatever object, however vague, however light, however spacious, however transparent-seeming, empty, fabrication. There is an even deeper fading because the [[Ignorance|avijja]] is being withdrawn, being undermined in that moment. So you can go into this, the whole process, taking up the teaching of [[clinging]] and going deeper and deeper with my [[Insight|understanding]] of what is involved in this term, clinging, and how to actually work with it to not cling in the moment. ^4-5
###### 5-1
We actually start to see that even [[attention]] - so to have any [[experience]], I need to in some way pay attention to that experience. Even if it is a very open attention, I am attending to the totality, [[Awareness|vast awareness]], there is attention there. And the mind is actually in a subtle way [[clinging]]. Attention works through a kind of clinging. I shut this out so I have this experience, the mind kind of grasps like a pair of calipers, it grasps at the object that we are paying attention to. So even attention is a form of clinging. So these [[Delineations|distinctions]], if we go back to the thing about the [[Dependent Origination|twelve links of dependent origination]], distinguishing between [[craving]] and clinging and [[sankhara]], et cetera, as we go deeper into the whole thing, the very delineations that we had started off with (and that are useful, as I said, at a certain level), they begin to blur, and we see how clinging, craving, sankhara, [[Ignorance|avijja]], attention - these notions overlap. They are all different forms of clinging, if you like. ^5-1
###### 5-2
Even in the examples I gave earlier, for instance the example of me fretting over hoping that this woman calls me, you can see in that - so there is the [[The Self|self-view]] that I am, what was it, the self-view of perhaps I am not attractive, or I am not okay somehow, and the belief that it would prove that I am okay and attractive if she called me, et cetera. You can see that that [[Ignorance|avijja]] is already a [[clinging]]. I am clinging to that belief and the sense of self there is already a kind of clinging. My trying, my tendency to view things that way and my trying to prove it, that movement to prove it, is also a kind of [[craving]] and clinging. So even at that level, but certainly as you go deeper into this whole question in practice, practicing in these beautiful ways, very delicate, very subtle, but enormously opening in terms of the [[freedom]] and what they open and the sense of existence. You start to see that this word, clinging, has a huge range of subtlety. It covers a lot of ground. And as I said, all kinds of [[Delineations|distinctions]] start to blur and overlap, et cetera. ^5-2
###### 5-3
But essentially I learn how to play with releasing [[clinging]] in the moment, and clinging in this very broad sense, at different ranges of subtlety, through playing with different [[ways of looking]], and that develops. I see that as I do this and I let go of clinging very, very deeply, at a very deep level, the world of [[Perception|appearances]] - [[The Self|self, other, world, time]], et cetera - is [[Fabrication|fabricated]] less and less. And there is a spectrum here of clinging, of self sense, of [[dukkha]], of sense of objects, of solidity of time. All of that. It is one spectrum of fabrication. And if I develop the art of this, eventually I can - language is difficult, but eventually there can be a complete unfabricating. Nothing is fabricated at all, no subject, no object, no time, past, future or present, no space. Something that language cannot even approach except by negatives. And through that seeing of that dependent fabrication, dependent [[Emptiness|fading]], dependent unfabricating, and the totality of that in an [[experience]] of the [[Unfabricated]], I understand, I need to understand something: all things, all experiences, all [[Phenomenon|phenomena]], are empty. Empty meaning they do not exist independent of the mind, independent of the way of looking. ^5-3
###### 5-4
So I start with a very, if you like, rudimentary and simple concept of [[ways of looking]], there is different ways of looking at things and they involve different kinds of [[clinging]] to different degrees, and I can see a certain amount of [[fabrication]]. Included, as I said, in the idea of ways of looking is really the way of relating, the way of conceiving, the way of sensing, if you like, perceiving, framing, all kinds of things - all that is wrapped up in the way of looking. And this concept, ways of looking, and the concept of fabrication, very, very simple concepts. So even a beginner, even someone who does not meditate, can see this. Every [[Personhood|human being]] knows what [[papanca]] - if you talk about papanca, every human being will recognize that. Every human being. Even someone who is not gone within 10 miles of a [[meditation]] cushion knows the [[experience]] of papanca and knows the experience of coming out of papanca into a more normal state of [[consciousness]]. ^5-4
###### 6-1
So right there is a segment of this [[Fabrication|spectrum of fabrication]] - [[papanca]] being much more fabricated, [[the self]] so dense, to tight, the [[dukkha]] being fabricated more intensely, and the sense of issue or object or whatever it is we are obsessing about also more intense, more real, more dense, all of that. More normal state of [[consciousness]], still the sense of self, very real, et cetera, but less oppressive, less dense, less separate, less [[Contraction|contracted]], and similarly with the issue, et cetera. ^6-1
###### 6-2
And then a beginner who is just exposed to [[mindfulness]] and maybe even first [[retreat]] or first course in mindfulness actually gets tastes of states that involve even less [[fabrication]] than the normal state. Just a sense of this self being less solid, less fabricated in different ways possible, and even more ease than what they have known through a normal state of [[consciousness]]. So there a little spectrum - [[papanca]] at one extreme end, the normal state of consciousness, if you like, everyday walking around, and then if we say a state of mindfulness when it is, quote, "going quite well." Right there are three points on a spectrum, and the level of mindfulness is, of those three, the least fabricated. So right there it is like, this is not rocket science. What is possible though is to really extend that spectrum and really see how all our [[experience]] fits onto that, and in a way, the whole [[Dharma]] fits onto that. The whole Dharma is saying something about this spectrum of fabrication and its relationship with [[clinging]] and what that says about the world of [[Perception|appearances]] and their apparent reality. ^6-2
###### 6-3
So really what we are doing is taking these concepts of [[ways of looking]] and [[fabrication]] and, through practice, through experiential playing with ways of looking, we are contemplating the dependence of [[Perception|appearances]] on the mind and on [[clinging]], on the way of looking and on clinging. So then going back to, return to, if I am contemplating [[impermanence]], rapid impermanence in sort of intense perhaps [[Mahasi Sayadaw|Mahasi-style]] or [[Goenka|Goenka-style]] practice, et cetera, or just other forms of practice, and that is a way of looking - I am looking at impermanence and I get into a kind of groove of seeing beginnings and endings of things. So it is a way of looking. It is a way of looking. And then it is a way of looking that tends to, if you like, fabricate what it sees. So I start to see process. I start to see more beginnings and endings. And I start to have a sense of, or appearances begin to become more fragmented and I start to see, "Ah, now I am seeing the atomic reality of things." Am I? Is it the reality? Is it [[Ultimate Truth|the ultimate]] reality? Or is it just a way of looking that tends to, because I look in a certain way, what appears to me is conditioned by, fabricated by, that way of looking? ^6-3
###### 6-4
Yes, it is less [[Fabrication|fabricated]] than other [[ways of looking]], or it fabricates less than other ways of looking. Is it the end of fabrication? No. And certainly not is a state of [[mindfulness]] the end of fabrication, as I said before. It is like, "Ah, now there is no [[papanca]]. There is no obsessing. I am just with the simple [[experience]] of the [[pain]] in my chest or whatever it is, and therefore I am not fabricating because there is no papanca." No. Keep open this question: what is the limit of fabrication? It seems real. Everyone seems to talk as if these things are real - bare sensations, or if I am in a certain culture, the atomic process of mind moments and experiences. Is that [[Ultimate Truth|the ultimate]] reality? Or is that just a certain level of less fabrication? So I keep this framework of ways of looking and fabrication, and I just see - do not arrest that investigation, keep playing. Is there a way that it, whatever I had taken to be the baseline of non-fabrication, is actually still fabricated and I can learn to unfabricate that, too, whether it is a [[Awareness|vast awareness]], whether it is this momentary [[Impermanence|arisings and passings away]] of some impersonal process, whether it is just the sort of so-called [[Attention|bare attention]] to experiences. None of that is the end of fabrication. All of those perceptions are still fabricated and we can go deeper than that. ^6-4
###### 6-5
Now, if through contemplating rapid [[impermanence]] in [[meditation]] actually there is this pop that I described or a kind of explosion and one finds oneself suddenly - one does not find oneself; there is an explosion into the [[Unfabricated]], let us say, the Unconditioned, then, again, why is that happening? Well, it happened because there was enough of a release of [[clinging]] in the contemplation of rapid impermanence, the mind saw the impermanence and [[Letting go|just let go]], just let go. And it is the letting go of the clinging, because it unfabricates - because clinging [[Fabrication|fabricates]], so letting go of clinging unfabricates - and it is not the seeing the impermanence that reveals reality; it is seeing the impermanence that causes the mind to let go of the clinging, clinging in this very subtle way, and sometimes - sometimes this does not happen; a person is just seeing clinging again and again, or seeing impermanence again and again - but sometimes it can release the clinging at such a deep level that there is nonfabrication and there is an opening to the Unfabricated. But still I need to understand that. So if I am not seeing it in terms of [[ways of looking]], fabrication and clinging, I do not quite understand, as I said at the end of the first part, what is the relationship between this amazing Unfabricated and this world of [[dukkha]] and [[Perception|appearances]]. I need to understand something there. ^6-5
###### 7-1
So this way of approaching, what I have just described, this way of approaching the [[Insight|understanding]], the conception, conceiving of what [[Dharma|the path]] is, the aim of [[Clinging|non-clinging]] and approaching it in practice, it has the potential of really opening up something very radical, very radically in [[experience]], in terms of this spectrum into depth and depths of [[Fabrication|lessening fabrication]] and unfabricating. All kinds of beautiful mystical experiences there possible, and an experience of the [[Unfabricated]] as well. Both in terms of experience a radicality, and also in terms of understanding. So you might hear this and hopefully it at least makes a little bit of sense, but without practice it is going to be like, "This is strange. I do not know what he is talking about. I do not know." It sounds like either baffling or very far-fetched or, "Well, it is not the kind of thing that I am used to hearing." If I do not practice, I will not see this. And if I do not practice in certain ways that allow this and make this understanding, I will not see this, I will not understand, and hearing about it certainly will not have much impact. Sometimes, as I said, even practicing in certain ways does not have the impact because I am not conceiving of it in - even if there is this opening or that opening or this experience or that falling away or whatever, it does not have the right impact or the impact that it could have in terms of [[freedom]] and opening up the sense of existence, because I am not conceiving it, I am not framing it in a way that is actually helping it to do that. ^7-1
###### 7-2
Maybe I am limiting, as I said, my idea of, "This is [[Fabrication|fabricated]], and this is not fabricated." And I put a bottom limit to my exploration. Maybe I am conceiving in terms of reality rather than in terms of [[ways of looking]], and that is creating a wall that I can not go beyond, or I am not conceiving in terms of fabrication in a full enough way or even at all. So this teaching, you know, the [[Buddha]]'s central teaching, the [[Four Noble Truths]] - there is [[dukkha]] and it arises from [[clinging]], from [[craving]], as its cause, and there is the release of that, and there is ways to move towards releasing it; but the shorthand version, just: clinging/craving cause dukkha and there is the possibility of releasing that - and the teaching of [[dependent origination]], which is a sort of more detailed explanation of that, an analogy for that is perhaps that we find ourselves - we do not know how we got there; we wake up and we are, somehow, we realize, locked in what seems to be the inside of some kind of dark, semi-dark, I do not know, big castle or something, and there is all these corridors and stairwells and doors, which some of them open and some of them are locked, and we do not know where we are and how on Earth do we get out. And then we are given a map, maybe a map and one of those - I do not know what they call them - adjustable wrenches, you know, you can make it, depending on the bolt that you are trying to undo, make it larger, smaller. And then looking at the map I try and decipher what is going on. I start to see the doors to get out are on the ground floor and I am stuck on the third floor, so how do I even get down to the ground floor? Some doors are open, other doors on the way to the ground floor I need to unscrew them with my adjustable wrench, et cetera, and eventually, through all these things that I get, I find my way out, I find one of the doors and I can unscrew that and it actually leads to the fresh air, the daylight, the [[freedom]] of the outside. Completely different [[experience]]. ^7-2
###### 7-3
So the [[Buddha]]'s teaching of [[dependent origination]] is, if you like, a map, the map of the inside of that castle. I can locate myself and then I can start moving in these ways. And the teachings about [[clinging]] are like that adjustable wrench. So I can actually undo the imprisonment. Okay? [laughs] It is not such a good analogy - it is a little too gothic, but... yeah, there is lots of reasons why it is not such a good analogy. For a start, it turns out that the whole castle and imprisonment is a bit of an illusion, but. Anyway. The point is that clinging, the teaching of clinging is a tool and with skill we unlock something that has to do more with [[Insight|understanding]], understanding the dependent arising of [[Perception|appearances]], the [[fabrication]] of the appearances of [[The Self|self, other, world, time]], space, et cetera, the [[emptiness]] of these things. Maybe it was not such a good analogy. Never mind. But the fact is that clinging, the teaching of clinging, is a tool, is a key. ^7-3
###### 8-1
The teaching "do not try to repeat experiences," it can be skillful at times. We can [[Clinging|cling]] and get too constricted to try and repeat experiences. But actually, in a way, we need to see this many times. We need to see this dependent [[fabrication]] and dependent [[Emptiness|fading]] many, many times, because it is such a deep level of [[Avijja|delusion]] that is entrenched there for us to believe in the reality of things: "Of course I, of course this object in front of me, of course this feeling, this sensation or whatever it is, of course time, of course these are real things. They exist independently of the mind." We need to see many, many times this fading, very specifically through the release of [[craving]]. ^8-1
###### 8-2
So it is not that we are grasping at experiences so much; it is that we want to repeat certain experiences, including the difficult ones - we do not need to repeat them intentionally, because we have them anyway, but we want to see our [[experience]] going up and down on this [[Fabrication|spectrum of fabrication]] dependent on [[clinging]]. See that many, many times, until it becomes something in my heart knows the [[Emptiness|emptiness of all things]]. So if I do not understand in this sense, then the teaching "just [[Letting go|let go of everything]]," it will not be very deeply liberating. "Just let go of everything." I can hear that, and probably many people do hear that, in a way that presumes a certain level of [[realism]], of the independent reality of what we are not clinging to. So "just let go of this or that," I believe in this and that, and somehow I am letting go of it. Or there is some level of reality that remains. I can see that there is some construction, some fabrication, but there is some level of reality, maybe that atomistic [[reductionism]], "there is just this process of events, of [[consciousness]] and [[perception]] and [[vedana]] and all that," and that level of reality remains. And then you get teachings which conflate [[impermanence]] and emptiness. In that way of limited [[Insight|understanding]], just to say that [[the self]] is empty means there is nothing but impermanent moments, or you could say that of anything. But emptiness is saying something much deeper than impermanence, much more radical. ^8-2
###### 8-3
Or again, we might say, "Oh, just [[Letting go|let go of everything]], just being and just receiving. When I am doing that, I am not engaging a [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]]; I am just receiving purely. I am just being. I am not trying. I am not doing any way of looking." Oftentimes people hear about this way of looking, "Oh, that is interesting. Interesting. Sometimes I just want to rest and not do and not have a way of looking." There is always a way of looking. So if we do not understand this teaching deeply enough, some level of [[realism]], which is basically [[Avijja|delusion]], [[Ignorance|avijja]], remains, and then we believe in things like the atomistic [[reductionism]] [[perception]], or we believe that I can do something called "just being" and that that is not doing, or that I can just receive or whatever, I can somehow have a mode of being that has no way of looking. ^8-3
###### 8-4
So somehow I have to pick up this teaching of [[Clinging|non-clinging]], of [[letting go]], of what it means to let go of everything - I have to approach it in a certain way. I am not trying to live without clinging. I am trying to use the teaching of clinging and [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]] and [[fabrication]] and [[ways of looking]], all of which are intimately linked with each other, and that functions as this adjustable wrench and this map, this tool, key, if you like, to unlock something. Actually I can not live without clinging, because when I start - this is curious now, and again, without the [[experience]] of this, and without [[Insight|understanding]] a certain way, this is going to sound bizarre, but I can not live without clinging because clinging is a part of perceiving, experiencing anything. As I said, it is part of [[attention]]. And when I really let go of clinging very deeply, in that moment, [[Perception|appearances]] do not appear. There is no perception. ^8-4
###### 8-5
If I really just [[Letting go|let go of everything]], the world does not appear. [[The Self|Self, world, time]] do not appear. ^8-5
###### 8-6
So this is interesting. And this actually - I do not know if people, it seems to me most people are not aware of this, but this actually caused a huge conundrum in the [[history]] of [[Buddhism]]. How does an arahant and how does a [[buddha]], fully [[Awakening|enlightened]], therefore supposedly no [[Ignorance|avijja]], no [[craving]], how do they perceive anything? If [[perception]] is part of the fourth link of [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]], what is called namarupa, and if there is no avijja and there is no craving, then actually perception does not arise. You can [[experience]] that in [[meditation]] and know it for a fact in meditation. So someone says, "Well, the arahant or a buddha has a residual amount of kind of karmic momentum that enables them to have appearances, et cetera, but at their [[death]], their final [[Unfabricated|nirvana]], that is dissolved, and so they are not reborn again." In other words, the world of perception is not reborn for them. There is total unbinding of the world of perception. ^8-6
###### 9-1
When it came to the [[Mahayana]] historically, a few hundred years after the [[Buddha]]'s [[death]], this was then - even that explanation was a problem for a number of reasons. If a Buddha was devoted to, even though they were completely free, completely devoid of [[Avijja|delusion]], if they were devoted to [[Perception|appearing]] again and again, being reborn to serve [[Dukkha|suffering]] beings out of [[compassion]], to help people, how is it that they could have appearances? You understand? They have no [[Ignorance|avijja]]. They have no [[craving]]. Avijja and craving/[[clinging]] are needed for the [[fabrication]] of appearances. So you get this very strange sort of basis for - that is not the right way of saying it. But from a certain perspective, that was the basis for a whole complex elaboration of Mahayana philosophy. I do not think it is that simple, because I think the Mahayana had lots of [[Insight|insights]] that was not just trying to fudge an explanation of how a Buddha could come back, because in the [[Theravada]], once a buddha's gone, they are gone; they do not get reborn. Arahants do not get reborn, et cetera. ^9-1
###### 9-2
In the [[Mahayana]] teaching, there is actually a teaching that most people respect that says only a [[buddha]] - not even an arahant, but only a buddha - can contemplate the full [[Emptiness|emptiness of things]] and have [[Perception|appearances]] at the same time. As I explained in the practices, for someone who is not a buddha, which includes an arahant, when they, if you like, lean heavily - in attending to something, whatever it is, a sensation, a perception - in the very attending to that object, they are leaning, if you like, or they are using a [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] that also knows thoroughly the emptiness of that object, then that object fades. So either everything fades when they fully contemplate emptiness, or they have to kind of go into a mode where they are not actually leaning so much on that [[insight]] of the emptiness. And, if you like, this residual [[Ignorance|avijja]], this kind of default avijja, is reasserting itself so that they can have appearances. If you are listening to this, "This is so abstract," but it is a funny thing, and if you know this level of practice, and if you understand a certain way, you see this is true. I cannot have a full leaning on the insight of emptiness at the same time as I have the appearance of an object. It will fade to the degree that I lean on, that I allow the fullness of that knowing of its emptiness into the way of looking. Only a buddha, it is said, is able to see both - both fully know the emptiness and have the appearance of things. ^9-2
###### 9-3
This can seem like a very strange, abstruse, abstract [[Mahayana]] teaching, but there is a reason, if you are following all this. There is a reason for it. Reasons. And then one way of conceiving of what [[Vajrayana]] practice is, [[Tantra|tantric]] practice is, is it is kind of, if you like - and I use this word in a positive sense - faking a [[buddha]] mind, so that we are kind of allowing our [[insight]] of the [[emptiness]] of whatever it is we are perceiving, we are allowing that to pervade the [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]], but in a lighter way so that this object that I am looking at becomes relatively transparent and I know its emptiness, but I am not leaning on that insight into emptiness so much that it actually fades. So I am kind of playing with, walking a tightrope of keeping [[Perception|appearances]] around, but seeing them, knowing them as empty. If I lean on that insight too much of the emptiness as I am looking at this object - I am not going away from the object; I am looking at it but knowing its emptiness - that object will fade. There is much more to it involved, and we are going to come back to this. But tantric practice, one of the aspects that is involved is this kind of faking of the buddha mind that can actually fully know the emptiness and have the appearance. We will return to this. But the point is, I cannot live without [[clinging]] because clinging is part of perception. Clinging is necessary for perception. Very subtle levels of clinging are necessary for perception. ^9-3
###### 9-4
On top of that, [[clinging]] is empty, too. Clinging has no inherent existence. And again, this is something that is really emphasized by all the great [[Mahayana]] teachers, Nagarjuna, Chandrakirti, you name it. So they say there is no grasper to be found, [[Anatta|no self]] grasping, there is no object of grasping to be found, neither is grasping to be found; all these are empty, all these are void, all these are illusory - pick your words. There is countless instances of these statements. No grasper, no grasped, no grasping, no clinger, no clung to, no clinging. They are empty. They are illusory. So you put all this together and you start to have a different [[Insight|understanding]] of the whole thing. It starts to open up in different possibilities and certainly a different level of understanding. We say do not cling to non-clinging. It is empty and it is wrapped up in [[perception]]. Do not cling to the idea of non-clinging. So this is strange now. There is space for clinging. Because I know it is empty, because I know it is part of perception, part of the magic of appearances, there is space for clinging. Clinging is given permission, if you like. ^9-4
###### 10-1
So "achieved is the end of [[craving]]" does not mean that I am living in some way without craving. ^10-1
###### 10-2
What would that mean, if [[craving]] is part of [[perception]]? Does not mean that; it means seen and understood is this relationship between craving, [[clinging]], [[fabrication]], and the lessening of craving and the lessening of fabrication and the, if you like, dissolution of craving temporarily and the opening into the [[Unfabricated]]. And all this implies, as I said, the [[emptiness]] of everything, of [[the self]], of the mind, of [[consciousness]], [[awareness]], whatever word you want to use for it, of objects, of world, of space, of time, of clinging, everything empty, fabricated, illusory. Actually can go even beyond that level of [[Insight|understanding]]. ^10-2
###### 10-3
Something happens in approaching it this way and seeing it this way and [[Insight|understanding]] something that opens up the sense of existence. [[Mystical opening]] of the whole sense of existence. Radically different sense. I am no longer being in this world that seems pretty real and attempting to try and live without [[clinging]]. Free to [[Craving|crave]], free to play with different degrees of craving in my [[ways of looking]], free to [[Fabrication|fabricate]] more or less. Skill here, art actually, art. Free to engage the art of fabrication, to let it go completely quiet, to fabricate in different ways, to different degrees. This becomes part of the practice because I understand something. So I can fabricate a little, I can fabricate a lot, can go into the [[Unfabricated]]. So then what we might call simple [[mindfulness]] or [[Attention|bare attention]] and the [[experience]] of the vividness of things and the simplicity of things, and sometimes what people call the [[Emptiness#Suchness|suchness]] of things, when it just feels like I am just so present, everything is so bright, it just is what it is - incidentally, that word suchness actually means completely the opposite of that in the tradition. It means the [[Emptiness|emptiness of things]], that they are not what they appear to be. They are exactly not what they appear to be - just this, just that, exactly as it is. Suchness means emptiness, means their lack of inherent existence, means that they are not anything in particular, they are fabricated, they are illusory, they are not like this or like that. Strange reversal of meaning that is happened historically, especially in the West. There is different reasons for that but I will not go into that now. ^10-3
###### 10-4
But that state of mind and that level of [[experience]] of what we call [[mindfulness]] or [[Attention|bare attention]], the vividness that comes with that and the [[beauty]] that comes with that, that is just a certain level of less [[fabrication]] than normal. If I am hanging out in what some people call [[Awareness|big mind]] or vast awareness or whatever, that, too, it is one degree of less fabrication, but it is still fabricated in a certain direction, this beautiful vastness, big mind, everything just arising out of that vastness, disappearing back into it. Lovely mystical state. It is one degree of less fabrication. It is a certain direction of fabrication. Or if I am seeing this rapid [[impermanence]], this atomistic process arising, passing, arising, passing, again, it is just one degree, it is a certain degree of less fabrication and in a certain direction, fabricating according to the [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]], just like the vast awareness. ^10-4
###### 10-5
And I can go much deeper, states of much less [[fabrication]], much deeper unfabricating than either of those, either the [[Awareness|vast awareness]] or this atomistic process. Much deeper. But even the really deep unfabrication, some of you might have heard of the formless [[jhanas]], these are available experiences - the realm of nothingness, the realm of neither perception nor non-perception, the seventh and the eighth jhanas, these deep states of unfabricating, of less fabrication. And even beyond that, as I said, to the [[Unfabricated]], the Unconditioned, the Unborn, the Deathless. And what happens, as I said, is then I can fabricate all these different directions and many more, actually infinite possibilities of fabrication, many, many more than that, in different directions and different degrees, and the whole art of fabrication, if you like, and that spectrum opens up for me and the directions of artful fabrication open up as practice, as play. All to do with [[ways of looking]] and fabrication. ^10-5
###### 11-1
So living without [[clinging]] is not the point of the [[Dharma]]. But [[Insight|understanding]], seeing the [[dependent origination]], the dependent [[Emptiness|fading]], the [[fabrication]], the dependent fabrication, dependent on clinging, and through that, seeing the emptiness of things - these are interchangeable, means the emptiness of all things. This is the point of the Dharma, and it opens so much up. Actually even this teaching of dependent origination, all those links, we start to understand in a way that that very teaching starts to melt itself. Those links, they melt, they overlap, they blur, they fade. We see they are not real things, either. Again, Nagarjuna, other - the [[Mahayana]] made this very clear: all twelve links of dependent origination are illusions. They are fabricated. They are empty. They are not real. Again, choose your lingo. You can find many, many instances of that, absolutely insisted upon. The teaching of dependent origination, the twelve links, this is not a reality. This is a tool. This is a key that then dissolves itself. Dissolves, melts itself, that whole link, in [[experience]] as we open to the [[Unfabricated]], but also in understanding because we understand that these are not real things, we are not talking about separate things, we are not talking about elements, real elements or components of a real process here. This was an incredible skill of the [[Buddha]], finding concepts that we can pick up and use as [[ways of looking]], use as ways of looking, and if we approach it in that spirit we begin to see that the very ways of looking lead to other ways of looking and the whole thing kind of dissolves itself and opens up a [[freedom]] of experience but also a freedom of understanding, what comes with understanding. ^11-1
###### 11-2
Okay. So we can hear teachings and assume that what we are hearing, or conclude from what we are hearing or reading, or in some instances we are actually taught that the [[Dharma]] is, the point is, the aim is, "Try to be in the world without [[craving]], without [[clinging]]. Be kind. But because everything is [[Impermanence|impermanent]], try to be in the world without craving, without clinging, and you will suffer less." So obviously there is some truth to that, but what if we understand the Dharma and approach it, in these teachings of [[dependent origination]], dependent [[Emptiness|fading]], [[fabrication]], [[ways of looking]], [[Four Noble Truths]], clinging, all that, as keys that unlock, that unbind the apparent nature of reality and reveal everything as empty, reveal the world as empty, as magical illusion, and that is the point of the Dharma? And what that then allows for us becomes the point and the aim of the Dharma. Because then, as I said, we can shape [[perception]]. We can fabricate in different ways. This self is empty. I know that thoroughly. There is no [[The Self|self-view]] at all, not process, not atoms, not [[Awareness|big awareness]], not nothing - any self-view is empty, is a fabrication. I can therefore shape this empty self in different ways. I can fabricate different kinds of selves, fabricate different kinds of appearances of the world, of others, all kinds of things, of time, through the art of practice. And there is a huge range there. ^11-2
###### 11-3
And the selves that I know are illusory, that I know are [[Fabrication|fabrications]], that I fabricate deliberately and skillfully as arts, they do not have to be [[Constriction|constrained]] to look a certain way: "I always have to look calm, especially as I am a [[meditation]] teacher." [laughs] Or I am a Buddhist. I do not always have to look unexcited. That is a certain fabrication of self. If I know it is illusory, well, there is a lot more room to play with. There is a lot more dressing up, a lot more garments to try on, to have fun in the magic clothes shop changing room, if you remember Mr Benn from English TV. [laughs] You have to be a certain age! Okay. So this is really, to me, it is really important, and it makes a huge difference to what we even consider the [[Dharma]] is or where we are going. ^11-3
###### 11-4
Actually I will just throw one more thing. Just to point out in addition to all this that most [[letting go]], most [[Clinging|non-clinging]], involves actually another object of clinging. And there is no problem with this, it is just almost inevitably it is like how we do not cling. So people who "just let go, just let go," as if we do that independently of clinging to something else. So, I do not know, someone who is addicted to alcohol or drugs or something like that, you know, talk to someone who is been through that and come out the other end. They did not just let go. There was a process there where they actually clung, and sometimes for dear life, they clung to something that was more [[Kusala|wholesome]]. Maybe they clung to a certain ethical - the 5th precept or whatever, through the support of the [[sangha]]. They clung to their [[sila]]. Maybe the fellowship, twelve step fellowship. Maybe even they took on the identity, "Hello, my name is x, and I am an addict, I am an alcoholic," and that clinging to a certain identity was absolutely necessary in letting go of the addiction. ^11-4
###### 12-1
Or in [[Buddhism]] and all kinds of - whether it is secularly conceived or whether it is religiously conceived, and all kinds of other religions, actually a person is able to let go because effectively they are [[clinging]] to a [[Devotion|faith]], some faith in something or other, again, whether that is a secularly conceived faith or a religiously conceived faith. The clinging to the faith and the vision of the faith and what that faith holds out enables them to let go of this or that. Even those examples from practice that I described earlier in this talk - so in this [[anatta]] [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]], that incredible depth and [[beauty]] of [[letting go]] is allowed because effectively or realistically I am clinging to the view, the way of looking, of anatta. I cling, I am clinging to this way of looking, seeing everything, everything that comes up, I am just in that groove of deliberately, very subtly but deliberately, lightly, seeing things as not-self. So I am effectively clinging to an [[insight]] in order to let go at a much deeper level. ^12-1
###### 12-2
Or even if I just say I am in a state of [[letting go]] or resting in [[awareness]] - some people use that phrase - or I am just receiving, I am just open to things, that still, I am in a [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] then, as I emphasized before. It is not that there is no way of looking. There is certainly a way of looking there, replete with all kinds of subtle [[Conceptual Framework|conceptuality]] and a certain relationship with things, a certain mode, replete with doing. Please do not think that that state - it is relatively less doing; still involves doing. But I am effectively [[clinging]] to that doing and that conception and that way of looking, and that clinging enables letting go. So I think it was one of my teachers teacher's teacher, I think, [[Ajahn Dhammadharo]], a Thai monk, I am not sure when he died - he died quite young in Thailand, a Forest monk in Thailand. I think it was him that used this analogy of it is like a ladder. The [[Dharma]] and practice is like a ladder. So when you are climbing a ladder, for your feet to let go of the bottom rung, first I need to put my feet on the bottom rung, then to let go of the bottom rung my hands grip another rung, or my one foot, if you like, grips or finds a basis in the next rung. My hands, probably, unless I am trying to do it without hands, something's gripping something, if you like, higher, or more subtle. And in this way we go. ^12-2
###### 12-3
If we take the addiction example, [[clinging]] to [[sila]] is a more refined clinging than clinging to alcohol. Clinging to [[anatta]] is a much more refined clinging than clinging to [[The Self|self-view]] ("this is me, this is mine," in its even unconscious way). And then even clinging to the view of anatta, even clinging to the view of [[emptiness]]. So the process of non-clinging develops through clinging to something else. We do not [[Letting go|just let go]]. Again, we are so attracted by the simplicity, the seeming simplicity of that statement, but like with a ladder, eventually you reach the last rung and you can let go, you can let go of the ladder, or the [[Buddha]]'s analogy of the raft crossing the stream, the river, whatever it is. You can let go of the ladder, the raft. ^12-3
###### 12-4
But it happens progressively, at more and more subtle levels. If I do not have a [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] and ways of [[clinging]] to more subtle things, this idea of "just [[Letting go|let go of everything]]," it really is pretty silly, and it will just end up either with complete frustration or blindness to what I am clinging to, or just this kind of like, "Oh, well. What are you going to do? It is hard. Maybe the real masters somewhere living in some caves can do something, but basically the rest of us have just to put up with our [[Avijja|delusion]] and our clinging." And we try and let go of the grosser clingings and we laugh at ourselves, et cetera. But much more is possible. ^12-4
###### 12-5
So it does not make sense, as I said, to live without [[craving]] or [[clinging]], because it is involved in the [[fabrication]] of [[perception]]. It is involved in experiencing anything. But as I said at the beginning of the last talk, there is a second problem. There is a second problem with this ideal of living without clinging, in addition to what I have said in this talk. There is a second problem. Would we even really, deep down, want to? So not to do with [[Avijja|delusion]], but is it what really the depths of the heart and the being want? What would it even look like, really? So this is what I want to explore a little bit. ^12-5
