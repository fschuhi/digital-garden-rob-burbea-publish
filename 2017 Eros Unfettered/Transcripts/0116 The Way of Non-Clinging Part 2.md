Okay, so how might we think about this teaching about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_? How might we conceive of it and this aim of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">non-clinging</a></span>? How might we conceive of that and approach it in practice in ways that _do_ open up the full depth of what is possible, and do not constrain the breadth of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> and possibility for us in our lives? What are the ways, what are the possibilities of conceiving and approaching, in practice, this area, this theme of the teaching<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > What are the ways of conceiving this teaching" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#What are the ways of conceiving this teaching" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^1-1

There are a few ways into this we could go, but let me try and say something briefly about it. One possibility is to take up this theme - not to actually _wait_ until we're in the grip of some obsessive <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> around something or other, and then try and let go of that (important as that is, to address those kind of states of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and states of being when they arise, and how can we find some relief, how can we see in a different way). But actually to take up this theme of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> as a theme, and to run with it even when it seems like there's not much <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> going on. So for example, in sitting or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">walking meditation</a></span>, standing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> or whatever, we can actually, as I mentioned in the last talk, in the first part of this talk, begin to get familiar and more and more sensitivity to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of something contracting in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. Even when there's no thought there, something's contracting towards a sensation, towards an idea, towards an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, away from. So it could be, again, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> at something, or pushing something away, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Experience of craving and clinging of something contracting" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Experience of craving and clinging of something contracting" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2

This subtle feeling, we get more and more familiar with, and we notice: this is _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_. This <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> itself feels unpleasant. As I said, it might be much subtler than even noticeable in the musculature. We're talking about just the sense of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">subtle body</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, the sense of the space of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. Feeling it, feeling its _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_. We're talking about subtle _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ now. Feeling that subtle _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ and relaxing, relaxing the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">subtle body</a></span>, relaxing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, relaxing that tension that's come in with that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>/<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, releasing it. So actually working directly with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> of that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span>, and releasing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span>. Now, you could, as I said in the first part, you could think about the object. You could contemplate its <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, etc. Or you can work directly with the actual energetics of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. So that's just an alternative way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Relaxing the subtle dukkha" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Relaxing the subtle dukkha" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3
###### 1-4
If you start doing this, and you start actually getting quite skilled, there's an art in this, and you start to develop a sensitivity, as I said. And it gets more subtle, because when I let go of, when I release a certain amount of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span> comes into the being, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. There's an openness. There's a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span>. And that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span>, like when the water is calm in a pond or a lake or something, I can actually pick up even more subtle levels of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. So then I can feel that, very subtle, and release those, and even more calm. The very <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span> that's made possible through the release, again and again, finding some <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, releasing it, finding some <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, releasing it, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span> that can open up through that actually allows me to go deeper, more subtle into the process<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > The calmer I get the even more subtle levels of craving I can pick up" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#The calmer I get the even more subtle levels of craving I can pick up" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4
###### 1-5
So this is actually a very enjoyable process. Most people who work that way in practice - it's a certain way of working. It's a very, very lovely way to practise. Very lovely. All kinds of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> and softening and ease comes in. We start to notice something. First thing is: oh, yes, when I let go of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ releases. So we could say the _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ is being <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span> by the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. I feel, viscerally, in my felt <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, again and again, I just see: <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>._ And I feel it. I feel its tension. And I feel the ease, the relief of the _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ right there. _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a></span>_ here means something really quite broad in its range, really from quite gross to really, really quite subtle<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Feel its tension feel its release" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Feel its tension feel its release" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-5
###### 2-1
But as I develop this practice, and work with it, and enjoy it, and develop my sensitivity and the art of it, I also start to realize that the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> is also <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span> with and by the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. In other words, the more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, the more solid the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, the more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">contracted</a></span>, the more separate from others or from the world. So this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, I start to see it, like the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, move up and down on a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">spectrum of fabrication</a></span>. Sometimes it's so solid, so dense, so separate. And when I let go of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, and when I let go at the deeper end of this spectrum, the whole <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> gets much lighter, much more transparent, much more melted, much less well-defined, its edges. It melts into a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>, etc., or it begins to dissolve in different ways<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Sense of self is fabricated with and by the craving" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Sense of self is fabricated with and by the craving" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
And then, correspondingly, there's a mutual dependence the other way: the stronger the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, the more that tends to build <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, unless we come in and work with it this other way, by releasing. But the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">experience of self</a></span> are dependent on <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. More <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, more self, if you like. Less <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, less self gets <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span>. Very interesting. It doesn't stop there, either, because as I develop this practice, and I enjoy it, and I get into it, and I feel the yumminess of it, I start to see not just _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, not just the sense of my self in the moment, but also the sense of the very objects that I'm paying <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to, and the sense of the very world that I feel myself to be in, that, too, gets correspondingly more solid, more separate, more of an issue, more prominent in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> to the degree that I am <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. More <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, more solid and more dense and more real, if you like, the world becomes, and more oppressive. Let go of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, let go at a deeper level, start to see these dependencies, start to see objects, too, begin to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span> out. They begin to melt. They begin to blur. The very <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of objects, the very <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of the world, is also dependent on <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> to a certain extent<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Less craving less self gets fabricated - - fading" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Less craving less self gets fabricated - - fading" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
Now, some people, this practice really works, and can take you very, very deep. Other people, it sort of comes to a limit, and they have to slightly change the practice, or move to something else. {But basically, one way of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> what's happening there is that we are, at any moment in time, always inevitably engaging what I would call a '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>.' That's a shorthand phrase. What it really means is a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, a way of perceiving, a way of relating, and a way of conceiving. I use this word, 'conceiving,' not just to mean 'thinking about.' Even when I'm _not_ thinking, I'm still conceiving. I'm still vaguely feeling there's a 'me' and an 'it'; there's a self, a subject, and an object, and it's happening in time. Even if it's just this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Present moment" class="internal-link">Present moment</a></span>, nothing else going on but the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> and the object and a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Present moment" class="internal-link">Present moment</a></span>, that's still conception. I've got the tripod there of subject, object, time.} There's still conception<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > The tripod of subject object time" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#The tripod of subject object time" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
So I use this word, 'conceiving,' to mean something much, much deeper and more pervasive and more subtle than thinking, but it also includes thinking. So a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> is (wrapped up, all together, in any moment) the way of relating, the way of perceiving, seeing, sensing, and the way of conceiving. All that together, just for shorthand, I'm <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Passion" data-href="Passion" class="internal-link">calling</a></span> a '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>.' And in any moment, there's always a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. There's _always_ a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. Now, that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> might have a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> in, or it might have less <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, or it might have really a little <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, or it might have really, really, really a tiny [amount], only the subtlest <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. But always at some moment, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, the being, is somewhere on that spectrum of how much <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and what kinds of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> are going on in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > There is always a way of looking with more or less clinging" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#There is always a way of looking with more or less clinging" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 3-1
And I start to see. I start to make connections here: dependent on the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, including how much and what kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> is going on, dependent on that is my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a></span> of _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, certainly. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">Experience of self</a></span> as well. And <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of the object that I'm paying <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to, the objects and the world around me. Also the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of time. All kinds of things. More <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>,_ of self, of objects, of world. Less <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, less <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. So there is, as I said here, a spectrum of subtlety. It gets extremely subtle, and as we all know, it can be very, very gross, the level of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and the solidity that comes into all these experiences of _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, of self, of other, of world<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Experience is dependent on the way of looking" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Experience is dependent on the way of looking" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
So when you start to explore this way, apart from the loveliness of this practice, uncovering more subtle levels of _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ is actually, contrary to what it might sound at first, like, "Oh, that's horrific, the sort of excavation of more and more _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, more and more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>," no. Because I'm feeling the _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, I'm releasing it, I'm finding ways to release, it actually feels very beautiful. There's great <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>, great, as I said, yumminess, really, in this practice. Really, really lovely way of practising. As I start to do this, the whole distinction between words like '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>' and '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>' also starts to melt. It's okay. It's valid at a certain level, but actually it's not getting to the really <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Juiciness" data-href="Juiciness" class="internal-link">juicy</a></span> stuff. It's not really opening things out in a very deep way, to hang on, to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a></span>, in effect, to a distinction between <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, for instance<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Uncovering more subtle levels of dukkha is a lovely practice" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Uncovering more subtle levels of dukkha is a lovely practice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2

What I start to see - I'm just picking this one way of practising as a way in; could pick another one - but I start to see the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of my entire <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, but let's just say, for now, just of self (but also of objects, as I said). The <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span>: they arise dependent on the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, dependent on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, and dependent essentially on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. If we say the same thing in other words, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span> of things and of objects, and of time and of world, and all of that, dependent on <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. And I start to understand: what does it mean to say that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> is empty? What does it mean to say that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span> appear, but they are empty? They're dependent arisings. They're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrications</a></span>. They're illusory. They do not exist. This self-sense that seems so real, this object-sense that seems so real, this thing before me, this thing in my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, this emotion, whatever it is, seems so real - it's a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span>. It's a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span> illusion. It is not a thing in itself, without the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> at it or to it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Dependent arisings are empty fabricated illusiory" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Dependent arisings are empty fabricated illusiory" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3

I start to understand. I probably start to see it first more easily with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, but it can happen different ways. And then maybe that leads to another kind of practice. Maybe I see a certain amount of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, through this developed art of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. And I start to have a conviction: "Yeah, this self is an illusion." And so when it feels like I'm looking at something and I see, "Oh, that's me. It's me. I _am_ this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, or I _am_ this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, or that is _my_ <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, or this is _my_ emotion or whatever," I start to see that's kind of an illusion, because I've seen this whole self is a construction, a concoction, a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. It's a _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sankhara" data-href="Sankhara" class="internal-link">saṅkhāra</a></span>_, in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s words. Then maybe I can move to another kind of practice, which is: let me just dwell, in my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">sitting meditation</a></span>, in my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">walking meditation</a></span>, my standing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>, and just whatever arises, I'm regarding it as _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_. _Attā_ means 'self' in Pali; _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_ means '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>.' This is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>. It's not me.

So _this_ becomes a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. Some people can just move straight into that practice. Other people need to do another practice that enables it a little bit. But at some point, I could, if I want, change practices and move into that. It's another <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. I'm regarding whatever comes up as _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_. Whatever comes up is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>, is not me, not mine. This isn't a big, laborious thinking process. It's a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. It's immediate. It's something that's permeating my very perceiving. It's a conception, for sure, but it's also a cutting or replacing of the usual unconscious conception, which is "this is me, this is mine." We don't often _think_ that, but we have a sense. I look at my hand: it's _my_ hand. It's not yours, it's mine. A memory comes up, it's mine. I don't even have to think this, but that conception is operating naturally. So we're just kind of letting that more usual conception go away, and replacing it with another conception: not me, not mine. That becomes the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Anatta practice whatever comes up is not self not me not mine" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Anatta practice whatever comes up is not self not me not mine" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-1

And again, this can be extremely powerful. It's a beautiful, beautiful practice to develop as an art, and there's lots to it. Like any practice, it has lots of subtleties and nuts and bolts. You need to learn how to navigate it and stuff. You can really develop it. Very, very beautiful. What will happen? Something similar to what we described in that practice of releasing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>: the world of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, the world of objects, even as I pay <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to them, they <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span> - not because they're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span>; because I'm releasing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>.

I don't necessarily move to this fast, momentary <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>.

So, for instance, paying <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to, again, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> in my back, or in my knees, or whatever, and "_<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_," and maybe even the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> that knows this _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_, this unpleasant _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_, it's also _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_. I develop that skill. Takes time. Really an art to develop here, and in stages usually. I've talked about it elsewhere; I'm going very quickly now. And it's not that I then see this rapid <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_. No, I actually see that unpleasant _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_ will - not trying to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">push it away</a></span> with this _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_ <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, but it's almost like it doesn't matter. I've let go of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> of the believing it's me or mine, and the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_ itself first goes towards - actually it might go towards pleasant, funnily enough, but eventually it goes towards neutrality. What was unpleasant either loses its unpleasantness more and more, and may go through a stage of being actually pleasant. But eventually, if I keep doing it, keep doing it even on the pleasant _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_, it becomes neutral. And then, eventually, even those neutral sensations disappear. There's no sensation there in the knee any more. I'm staring right at it. It's not that I'm not paying <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>. I'm certainly not distracted. It's faded. It's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="unfabricated" class="internal-link">unfabricated</a></span>. And I start to see, again: dependent on the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> is the construction of my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, and what appears to me<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Even the pleasant vedana become neutral and even those neutral sensations disappear" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Even the pleasant vedana become neutral and even those neutral sensations disappear" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-3

And this practice can go really deep, the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_, in terms of how much it can deconstruct or unfabricate the world of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span>. And then, again, based on _that_ practice, maybe I really start to have a conviction: because I see it again and again, I start to see whatever appears (whether I take it as me or mine or whatever), it is empty. Not just that it is not me and it is not mine, but it is, in itself, empty. It's an illusory <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a></span>, to borrow the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s terminology. It's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. It's a concoction. It's a construction - a construction dependent on the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. If I look in a certain way, the world appears, and it appears very solid. If I look in other ways, it appears, but it appears much less solid. And if I look in certain ways, certain <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>, if I pay <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> in certain <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>, it does not appear. This thing that was troubling me, this thing that I loved, this thing that was neutral, fades<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Not just that is not me but it is empty" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Not just that is not me but it is empty" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-4

And this undermines. When I see this again and again, make the connections, it begins to undermine my belief in the reality of things, the reality of experiences, at _any_ level. And we're talking the atomic components of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, very rapid - the reality of anything at all. I cannot believe that they have an independent reality, independent of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. That belief that they _do_ have an independent reality is the most fundamental level of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_, of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>. And so, in the tradition, picked up especially in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a></span> tradition, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, this word, '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>,' has a much broader range of meaning than just the kind of gross obsession, etc., hanging on to something for grim life - just the belief that something has a reality independent of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, independent of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, if you like, just that belief. And again, we don't walk around thinking about this. This is how we tend to see, how we tend to view, how we tend to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. It's the default <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, at a very deep level.

Even if it's a very open <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> - I'm attending to the totality, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awareness" data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">vast awareness</a></span> - there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> there. And the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is actually, in a subtle way, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a></span> works through a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. I shut _this_ out so I have this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> kind of grasps - like a pair of calipers, it grasps at the object that we're paying <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to. Even <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> is a form of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>.

Even in the examples I gave earlier - for instance, the example of me fretting over hoping that this woman calls me - you can see in that, there's the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span> that I'm (what was it?), the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span> of perhaps I'm not attractive, or I'm not okay somehow, and the belief that it would prove that I _am_ okay and attractive if she called me, etc. You can see that that _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_ is already a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>.

My tendency to view things that way, and my trying to prove it, that movement to prove it is also a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>.

You start to see that this word, '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>,' has a huge range of subtlety. It covers a lot of ground. And as I said, all kinds of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">distinctions</a></span> start to blur and overlap, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Clinging has a huge range of subtlelty" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Clinging has a huge range of subtlelty" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-1

But essentially, I learn how to play with releasing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> in the moment, and '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>' in this very broad sense, at different ranges of subtlety, through playing with different <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>, and that develops. I see that as I do this, and I let go of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> very, very deeply, at a very deep level, the world of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span> (<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self, other, world, time</a></span>, etc.) is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span> less and less. And there's a spectrum here of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, of self-sense, of _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, of sense of objects, of solidity of time - all of that. It's one <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">spectrum of fabrication</a></span>. And if I develop the art of this, eventually I can - language is difficult, but eventually there can be a complete unfabricating. Nothing is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span> at all: no subject, no object, no time (past, future or present), no space. Something that language cannot even approach except by negatives.

###### 6-3
So I start with a very, if you like, rudimentary and simple concept of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>: there are different <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span> at things, and they involve different kinds of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, to different degrees. And I can see a certain amount of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. Included, as I said, in the idea of '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>,' is really the way of relating, the way of conceiving, the way of sensing, if you like, perceiving, framing, and all kinds of things. All that's wrapped up in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. And this concept, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>, and the concept of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> - very, very simple concepts. So even a beginner in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> - actually, even someone who doesn't meditate - can see this. Every <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> knows what _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_ [is]. If you talk about _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_, every <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> will recognize that. Even someone who's not gone within 10 miles of a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> cushion knows the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>,_ and knows the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of coming out of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_ into a more normal state of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Everybody knows what papanca is" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Everybody knows what papanca is" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-3

So right there is a segment of this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">spectrum of fabrication</a></span> - _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_ being much more <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> so dense, so tight; the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ being <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span> more intensely; and the sense of issue or object or whatever it is we're obsessing about also more intense, more real, more dense, all of that. More normal state of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, still the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, very real, etc., but less oppressive, less dense, less separate, less <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">contracted</a></span>, and similarly with the issue, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Papance on the spectrum of fabrication" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Papance on the spectrum of fabrication" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-4

And then a beginner who's just exposed to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, and maybe even first <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> or first course in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, actually gets tastes of states that involve even less <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> than the normal state - just a sense of this self being less solid, less <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span> in different ways possible, and even more ease than what they've known through a normal state of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>. So there, our little spectrum (_<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_ at one extreme end; the normal state of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, if you like, everyday walking around; and then, if we say, a state of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> when it's, quote, 'going quite well'), right there are three points on a spectrum, and the level of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> is, of those three, the least <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span>. So right there, it's like, this isn't rocket science. What's possible, though, is to really extend that spectrum, and really see how all our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> fits onto that, and in a way, the whole <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> fits onto that. The whole <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> is saying something about this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">spectrum of fabrication</a></span>, and its relationship with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, and what that says about the world of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span> and their apparent reality<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > The whole Dharma fits on a spectrum" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#The whole Dharma fits on a spectrum" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-1

So really what we're doing is taking these concepts of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> and, through practice, through experiential playing with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>, we're contemplating the dependence of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span> on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and on <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, on the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> and on <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. Going back to, return to, if I'm contemplating <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, rapid <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> in sort of intense perhaps <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahasi Sayadaw" data-href="Mahasi Sayadaw" class="internal-link">Mahāsi</a></span>-style or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Goenka" data-href="Goenka" class="internal-link">Goenka-style</a></span> practice, etc., or just other forms of practice, and that's a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>: I'm looking at <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, and I get into a kind of groove of seeing beginnings and endings of things. It's a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. And then it's a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> that tends to, if you like, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricate</a></span> what it sees.

And I start to have a sense of, or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span> begin to become more fragmented, and I start to see, "Now I'm seeing the atomic reality of things."

Now, if through contemplating rapid <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> actually there is this pop that I described, or a kind of explosion, and one finds oneself suddenly - one doesn't find oneself; there's an explosion into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a></span>, let's say, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a></span>, then, again, why is that happening?

It's not the seeing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> that reveals reality; it's seeing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> that causes the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> to let go of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> in this very subtle way.

So this way of approaching, what I've just described, this way of approaching the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, the conception, conceiving of what <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> is, the aim of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">non-clinging</a></span>, and approaching it in practice, it has the potential of really opening up something very radical, very radically, in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, in terms of this spectrum into depth and depths of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">lessening fabrication</a></span> and unfabricating. All kinds of beautiful mystical experiences there possible, and an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a></span> as well. Both in terms of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> a radicality, and also in terms of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>. So you might hear this, and hopefully it at least makes a little bit of sense, but without practice it's going to be like, "This is strange. I don't know what he's talking about. I don't know." It sounds, like, either baffling, or very far-fetched, or, "Well, it's not the kind of thing that I'm used to hearing." If I don't practise, I won't see this. And if I don't practise in certain ways that allow this and make this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, I won't see this, I won't understand, and hearing about it certainly won't have much impact. Sometimes, as I said, even practising in certain ways doesn't have the impact, because I'm not conceiving of it in - even if there's this opening or that opening, or this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, or that falling away or whatever, it doesn't have the right impact or the impact that it could have in terms of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> and opening up the sense of existence, because I'm not conceiving it, I'm not framing it in a way that's actually helping it to do that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > This needs practicing and right view" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#This needs practicing and right view" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-1

So this teaching, you know, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s central teaching, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Four Noble Truths</a></span> - there's _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>,_ and it arises from <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, from <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, as its cause, and there's the release of that, and there are ways to move towards releasing it; but the shorthand version, just <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>/<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> cause _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>,_ and there's the possibility of releasing that - and the teaching of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dependent origination" class="internal-link">dependent origination</a></span>, which is a sort of more detailed explanation of that. An analogy for that is perhaps that we find ourselves - we don't know how we got there; we wake up and we're, somehow, we realize, locked in what seems to be the inside of some kind of dark, semi-dark (I don't know) big castle or something, and there are all these corridors and stairwells and doors, which some of them open and some of them are locked, and we don't know where we are and how on earth do we get out. And then we're given a map, maybe a map and one of those - I don't know what they're called - adjustable wrenches, you know? You can make it, depending on the bolt that you're trying to undo, make it larger, smaller. And then looking at the map, I try and decipher what's going on. I start to see: the door to get out, or the doors to get out, are on the ground floor, and I'm stuck on the third floor. So how do I even get down to the ground floor? Some doors are open. Other doors on the way to the ground floor, I need to unscrew them with my adjustable wrench, etc., and eventually, through all these things that I get, I find my way out. I find one of the doors, and I can unscrew that, and it actually leads to the fresh air, the daylight, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> of the outside.

So the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s teaching of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dependent origination" class="internal-link">dependent origination</a></span> is, if you like, a map, the map of the inside of that castle. I can locate myself, and then I can start moving in these ways. And the teachings about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> are like that adjustable wrench. So I can actually undo the imprisonment. Okay? [laughs] I think that's not such a good analogy! It's a little too gothic. Yeah, there are lots of reasons why it's not such a good analogy - for a start, it turns out that the whole castle and imprisonment is a bit of an illusion. But anyway, the point is that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, the teaching of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> is a tool, and with skill we unlock something that has to do more with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self, other, world, time</a></span>, space, etc., the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of these things.

The teaching "don't try to repeat experiences," it can be skilful at times. We can <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a></span> and get too constricted to try and repeat experiences. But actually, in a way, we need to see this many times.

They exist independently of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>." We need to see many, many times this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a></span>, very specifically, through the release of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > We need to see the fading many times" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#We need to see the fading many times" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-2

So it's not that we're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> at experiences so much. It's that we want to repeat certain experiences, including the difficult ones - we don't need to repeat them intentionally, because we have them anyway, but we want to see our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> going up and down on this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">spectrum of fabrication</a></span>, dependent on <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. See that many, many times, until it becomes, "Something in my heart knows the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of all things</a></span>." If I don't understand in _this_ sense, then the teaching "just <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a></span>," it won't be very deeply liberating. "Just <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a></span>." I can hear that, and probably many people _do_ hear that, in a way that presumes a certain level of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="realism" class="internal-link">realism</a></span>, of the independent reality of what we're not <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to. So "<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">just let go</a></span> of this or that," I _believe in_ this and that, and somehow I'm <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> of it. Or there's some level of reality that remains. I can see that there's some construction, some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>, but there's some level of reality - maybe that atomistic <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="reductionism" class="internal-link">reductionism</a></span>, "There's just this process of events, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> and _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_ and all that" - and that level of reality remains. And then you get teachings which conflate <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. In that way of limited <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, just to say that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> is empty means there's nothing but <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span> moments, or you could say that of anything. But <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> is saying something much deeper than <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, much more radical<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Just let go of everything might still assume the reality of what to let go of" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Just let go of everything might still assume the reality of what to let go of" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-3

If <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> is part of the fourth link of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span>, what's called _nāmarūpa_, and if there's no _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_ and there's no <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, then actually <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> does not arise.

In the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a></span> teaching, there's actually a teaching that most people respect that says only a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> - not even an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">arahant</a></span>, but only a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> - can contemplate the full <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of things</a></span> and have <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span> at the same time.^[E.g. in the _Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra_ and the _Mahāyānasaṃgraha._ See also Rob Burbea, _Seeing That Frees: Meditations on Emptiness and Dependent Arising_ (Devon: Hermes Amāra, 2014), 402] As I explained in the practices, for someone who's not a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> (which includes an <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">arahant</a></span>), when they, if you like, lean heavily - in attending to something, whatever it is: a sensation, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> - in the very attending to that object, they're leaning, if you like, or they're using a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> that also knows thoroughly the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of that object, then that object fades. So either everything fades when they fully contemplate <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, or they have to kind of go into a mode where they're not actually leaning so much on that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. And, if you like, this residual _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_, this kind of default _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_, is reasserting itself so that they can have <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span>. If you're listening to this, "This is so abstract" - but it's a funny thing, and if you know this level of practice, and if you understand a certain way, you see this is true. I cannot have a full leaning on the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> at the same time as I have the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a></span> of an object. It will <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span> to the degree that I lean on, that I allow the fullness of that knowing of its <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> into the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>.

If I lean on that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> too much (of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> as I'm looking at this object) - I'm not going away from the object; I'm looking at it, but knowing its <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> - that object will <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span>.

Actually, even this teaching of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dependent origination" class="internal-link">dependent origination</a></span>, all those links, we start to understand, in a way, that that very teaching starts to melt itself. Those links, they melt, they overlap, they blur, they <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span>.

Okay. So we can hear teachings and assume that what we're hearing, or conclude from what we're hearing or reading, or in some instances we're actually _taught_ that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> is, the point is, the aim is, "Try to be in the world without <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> or without <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. Be kind. But because everything's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span>, try to be in the world without <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, without <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, and you will suffer less." Obviously there's some truth to that. But what if we understand the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> and approach it and these teachings of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dependent origination" class="internal-link">dependent origination</a></span>, dependent <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Four Noble Truths</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, all that, as keys that unlock, that unbind the apparent <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of reality and reveal everything as empty, reveal the world as empty, as magical illusion, and _that's_ the point of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>? And what that then _allows_ for us becomes the point and the aim of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>. Because then, as I said, we can shape <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. We can <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricate</a></span> in different ways. This self is empty.

There is no <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span> at all - not process, not atoms, not <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awareness" data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">big awareness</a></span>, not nothing - any <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span> is empty, is a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>.

If we take the addiction example, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sila" data-href="Sila" class="internal-link">sīla</a></span>_ is a more refined <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> than <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to alcohol. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a></span> to _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_ is a much more refined <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> than <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span> ("this is me, this is mine," in its even unconscious way). And then even <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to the view of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_, even <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to the view of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. So the process of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">non-clinging</a></span> develops through <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to something else. We don't <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">just let go</a></span>. Again, we're so attracted by the simplicity, the seeming simplicity of that statement, but like with a ladder, eventually you reach the last rung, and you can let go, you can let go of the ladder, or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s analogy of the raft crossing the stream, the river, whatever it is. You can let go of the ladder, the raft<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > The process of non-clinging dvelops through clinging to something else" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#The process of non-clinging dvelops through clinging to something else" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-3

But it happens progressively, at more and more subtle levels. If I don't have a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> and ways of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to more subtle things, this idea of "just <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">let go of everything</a></span>," it really is pretty silly, and we'll just end up either with complete frustration, or blindness to what I'm <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to, or just this kind of like, "Oh, well. What are you going to do? It's hard. Maybe the real masters somewhere living in some caves can do something, but basically the rest of us have just to put up with our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span> and our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>." And we try and let go of the grosser <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">clingings</a></span>, and we laugh at ourselves, etc. But much more is possible<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Much more is possible than just let go of everything" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Much more is possible than just let go of everything" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-4

So it doesn't make sense, as I said, to live without <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, because it's involved in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. It's involved in experiencing anything. But as I said at the beginning of the last talk, there's a second problem with this ideal of living without <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, in addition to what I've said in this talk. There's a second problem: would we even, really, deep down, want to? So not to do with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>, but is it what really the depths of the heart and the being want? What would it even look like, really?
