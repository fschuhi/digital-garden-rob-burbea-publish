Summary: [[Eros Unfettered Part 1]]

<br/>

###### 1-1
So let us begin to explore a little more, to unfold and unpack this movement of [[eros]], the movement of [[soulmaking]], what I have been [[Passion|calling]] the [[soulmaking dynamic]] or the eros-psyche-logos dynamic and look at that and some of its consequences, what it involves, what it brings into being and opens up, and also some of the ways that whole organic movement can be hindered or blocked or impeded or weakened or stopped in some way.^[Das ist eine Fu√ünote] So both speaking sort of in theoretical terms, but hopefully with examples and fleshing it out that way. So really there is a double intent here over the next few talks of opening up the possibilities of eros, opening up for ourselves the possibilities, the possible [[manifestations]] of eros in practice, in life, in our existence, in the way that we relate to existence and to [[image]], et cetera. So opening up the possibilities but also looking at what the possibilities of eros open for us, so what comes out for us, what is made available to us because of the movement and the manifestation, the different manifestations of eros. So double intent there. ^1-1
###### 1-2
In a way, through this, we are circling around things and ideas and teachings that we have already touched on. So there is the hermeneutic circle again; we are touching on something, touching on something else and then coming back to revisit the first thing, round and round in much the same way that a sewer sewing stitches or sewing a cloth or knitting a scarf or something will come back over the same area to add another thread, another color, or entwine threads together, in the way for instance a tapestry gets woven, working over the same material, back and forth, adding something, adding more intricacy, more density, more [[Papanca|complication]], more solidity, more color, et cetera. ^1-2
###### 1-3
You know, it is interesting. Some people certainly who work with this kind of material or [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]] would wonder, do wonder, "Okay, so I am exploring all this imaginal stuff and I am on this [[retreat]] or whatever, I am devoting a solitary retreat," someone devoted a month to exploring these practices, and it kind of occurs to them at some point, "Wow, there is a lot of [[eros]] here and often very sexual, explicitly sexual in the imagery, and why all this eros? Why all this [[sexuality]]?" So non-sexual and sexual eros in imaginal practice or imaginal retreats. "Why? Is that right? Is that correct? Is it okay and all that?" So we will go into all this as well. But why? It is a good question. It is an interesting question. ^1-3
###### 1-4
One reason is, to begin to give a response, one reason is we [[love]] [[eros]]. We love that fire and we love its [[juiciness]], the juiciness of eros in a more watery metaphor. We love that. Something in us loves that. And the more, if you like, eros there is flowing through us, the more we love it. In a way, eros loves itself. We will come back to that. Eros has its erotic connection with itself. So that is one part of it. Another thing is in [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]] in the way that we have set it up, the teachers and the teachings allow it. We allow that eros. And the teachings, the [[logos]], the [[conceptual framework]] that we have set up and we are setting up, the explanations, et cetera, they sanction it. They legitimize eros. The examples we give in the teaching also, through example, "This is an [[image]] of mine. This is an image of [[Catherine McGee|Catherine]]'s. This is what a yogi reported to us that we asked them and they said fine and we are sharing it." The examples we share also open something out, normalize it, legitimize it, give it place, give it space within the teachings. ^1-4
###### 1-5
And with the examples, also the [[Image|range of images]] that are described or related in the examples, the range is broad. And this is deliberate so that we get the sense of the range of possible archetypes, [[Imaginal|imaginal figures]], characters that come, that are operating, that demand [[attention]], that make other demands, that ask for reverence in a way and [[devotion]]. All of this is huge. So that - and I have spoken about this in other talks in the past - we are not locked in and certainly not unconsciously locked in to just a narrow range of sort of traditional Buddhist images of chastity, [[equanimity]], even temperament, evenness of [[mind]], [[Steadiness|calmness]], sobriety, just the [[fantasy]] of [[Hermit|the hermit]], you know. The range of images and archetypes is broad, and that gives permission for the ones that do not fit into the kind of, if you like, more official but unconscious canon of fantasy that often gets communicated in the teachings, in more, let us say, traditional teachings, among some streams of [[Buddhism]]. ^1-5
###### 2-1
So that is part of it, it is sanctioned by the teachings and the teachers and the examples, et cetera. ^2-1
###### 2-2
It is legitimized, given place. Another important reason is that [[psyche]] and the [[imaginal]] involves [[beauty]]. The imaginal involves beauty. Again, wide range of what that word, beauty, means. But generally speaking, beauty is a component, an element of the imaginal, of [[Image|images]] when they are alive as imaginal images to us. And where there is beauty, there is attraction. There is going to be [[eros]] as one kind of possibility of that attraction. So in a way, eros, as I think I said before already, is intrinsic to the imaginal. We could say that. So of course it is going to come up. You do imaginal practice, eros is intrinsic to it, of course it is going to come up. Eros is intrinsic to psyche, I would say, to some degree or other, and the more you allow the imaginal, the more you actually allow eros. ^2-2
###### 2-3
And if an [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]] is felt by us or regarded by us as other, as an otherness to us - it is not being reduced to a faculty of my [[mind]] or an aspect of my [[consciousness]] or even an aspect of my [[psyche]]; it is not being reduced to a result of my [[History|personal history]], et cetera - then that otherness, that [[personhood]] between me and the [[image]], or even between two different images, even two different intrapsychic images, [[eros]] is allowed because of the otherness there. Eros is an attraction between othernesses, we could say. And when, in that otherness, we feel or we regard images or we play with the perspective that images have a claim on us, they have a claim, a deep, far-reaching, profound, [[soul]]-resonant claim on the psyche, the way a lover does, the way a lover has a claim on us, or a nuptial claim of a spouse - so that claim on us is also erotic. It does not necessarily mean it is sexual, but it is erotic in the way a lover's claim is erotic, and it gives rise or it involves eros. ^2-3
###### 2-4
Always, and I think I have said this as well, where there is the [[imaginal]] and imaginal figures, it is not always apparent at first, but there is always some kind of [[love]]. It might be a kind of love, a flavor, an expression of love that does not fit into the usual range and the usual picture of what the [[mind]] has of what love looks like. It can be, for instance, quite stern or strong or involve very sort of seemingly even violent elements or something, but there is some kind of love there with imaginal figures, both ways. We love them and they love us. And there is a [[desire]] for contact. In a way, this imaginal figure is an angelos, is an [[Daimon|angel]], a messenger. It wants to make contact with us, and we want contact. We desire intercourse, if you like, in the broadest sense of that word, intercourse (again, not just sexual). And that desire for contact is, according to this very basic what I am [[Passion|calling]] the small definition, the loose definition of [[eros]], that is the desire for contact, to open to, to relate with. That is eros. Desire for contact. ^2-4
###### 2-5
And again, if an [[image]], as we sense more into an image - and again, it might not be at first obvious - but we sense more into an image, and what makes it an [[Imaginal|imaginal image]] is this quality or dimension that we begin to notice with imaginal images: their [[unfathomability]], their inexhaustibility. They are not reducible to this or that explanation. We do not ever figure them out, or if we do, they die. They can have this sense of endlessness to them, bottomlessness almost to them. And because of that, because of their unfathomability and inexhaustibility, there is, so to speak, always more for [[eros]], the erotic movement towards that image or in relation to that image, there is always more for the eros to open to. There is always more for it to penetrate. Always more for the eros to know. ^2-5
###### 2-6
So these words - penetrate, open, receive, know - these are all words with sexual connotations, as I said before, but there is no limit. There is no limit to the penetration because of the [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]]'s [[unfathomability]]. That imaginal figure might be an actual person, a live, flesh and blood person in our life, or that we know about, or historical person - we have been through all this before - that our [[perception]] of them is imbued with beautiful imaginal [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] and [[fantasy]] in the good sense of the word. And there is no bottom to that, so they are, in a way, infinitely penetrable, we can open to them endlessly. So all of that, and also sometimes - again, I have explained this before - wrapped up in [[Image|images]], or an image bears this message, this angelos, this communication somehow of a [[telos]], an end, a point, an end towards which the [[soul]] is moving. And so there is the [[eros]] of that magnetic attraction of the soul towards this telos, towards this end, something that we, the being, the soul, is beckoned towards, called towards, what [[Henry Corbin]] calls [[Daimon|the angel out ahead]], or we could say the divine root of something that we are called to. But that angel out ahead, we never reach. It is not that we reach it in some kind of union, we finish with that. There is an infinite movement towards that. It keeps moving further and further. We move towards it and it takes a step back and beckons us further and further, if you like, on [[Dharma|the path]] of [[soulmaking]], on the path of deeper, wider [[divinity]]. ^2-6
###### 3-1
So there is something about who we are becoming, our [[telos]], in some [[Image|images]]. They are redolent with that, they communicate that, they shine with that and beckon us in that way. And that telos implies or needs [[eros]], that erotic movement. So we could say all this in relation to this question, "Why all this eros? Why all this sexual imagery, even more, in the [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]] when a person devotes themselves to this kind of practice for a time?" So we could say all that. Of course, someone might say, "No, no, no. You let people daydream and what do you get? You get the defilements running amok, the defilements running away with themselves, the increase." So that might be someone's sort of knee-jerk assumption. But as I said, I hope you can really see when you explore these practices in the careful ways that we are talking about that that is absolutely not the case. We will revisit the doubts that may arise there, but you can see that is not the case. ^3-1
###### 3-2
So there is all these answers that we could give, but we can kind of tie all that together, again weave it together, through this I think more elegant explanation of what we have been [[Passion|calling]] the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]] or the soulmaking dynamic. If that is too kind of technical sounding for you, we can say the explanation, the exploration of how the fire of [[eros]] spreads, how it catches alight and sparks fire wider and wider so that it spreads; how the tree, if you like, of [[soul]] grows, the organic movement of the growth of this tree; or the way the web of [[soulmaking]] is woven. So these are different, maybe more poetic languaging of what we mean by the eros-psyche-logos dynamic or the soulmaking dynamic. ^3-2
###### 3-3
And I have talked about this in other talks, I think in those set of talks, A Sacred Universe: [[Insight]], [[Divinity|Theophany]], [[Cosmology|Cosmopoesis]], and in more detail than that in the series An Ecology of [[Love]]. But it is so important and so fundamental I want to revisit it again and add more to it and more [[dimensionality]] and more of the implications and what is involved. Why emphasize this so much? Why am I putting so much emphasis on this? Because I think, or it seems to me, that - it is a kind of theory; I guess it is theory, a kind of [[conceptual framework]], if you like, is itself a [[logos]] that explains quite a lot in a way that is relatively simple, and in that way, there is a kind of elegance to it. It integrates quite a lot of seemingly unrelated experiences or observations we have in life and in practice and in relationship. It ties a lot of things together that, at first sight, do not seem like they might have anything to do with each other. ^3-3
###### 3-4
It also, funnily enough, predicts quite a lot, like a kind of theory I guess predicts. So in the same way, for example, as the [[conceptual framework]] of [[dependent origination]] and [[emptiness]] and [[fabrication]] that we talked about earlier on the [[retreat]], on the course, [[Insight|understanding]] that, you begin to be able to predict, "Ah, yeah, when I look at something this way, that involves less [[Ignorance|avijja]], and so I expect that when I focus on whatever this thing is - a [[Embodiment|body]] [[pain]] or a visual [[perception]] or whatever - when I look at it that way, through that lens of less avijja, I expect that perception to fade." So there is a kind of prediction there. And we see with the practice, that kind of (what I would call) [[Meditation|insight meditation]] practice, practicing with emptiness and dependent origination, we actually see those predictions bear out. We develop that practice and lo and behold things fade as we would expect. And people report experiences to us and you would expect, I expect, if I ask someone, "And then what happened? Did it fade?", and they say yes. Why? Because we understand the kind of predictive power of that theory or conceptual framework or whatever. ^3-4
###### 4-1
And in the same way, it also has something, I think, this [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]], this sort of [[conceptual framework]] that I am offering, has something of a diagnostic capacity/capability as well. It is a different model of the [[psyche]], different psychological model, if you like, than a lot of the ones that we are used to. So it is another way of diagnosing what the problem is when we run into problems in relationship or intrapsychically or in all kinds of areas. And with all that, you know, it is also a conceptual framework that can guide our practice, and this is a big part of what these kind of [[Insight|understandings]] offer, whether it is [[emptiness]] or this area of [[soulmaking]] that we are talking about. Understanding the big picture, a conceptual framework that holds the big picture together, ends up being so helpful in guiding our practice because it informs the sort of micro-choices moment to moment: "What am I trying to do here? This thing seems kind of blocked. How can I understand that or bring some understanding to bear that opens it up again, that makes it more fertile, more rich, allows me to travel further, et cetera? Where do I navigate right now?" All that, the big picture, an understanding of the big picture informs the small, moment-to-moment micro-decisions in practice, or the more mid-level decisions about what should I focus on now for this [[retreat]] or whatever it is. And that is applicable to whatever you want to talk about - [[Meditation|insight meditation]] or the [[Dharma]] as a whole or soulmaking, et cetera. ^4-1
###### 4-2
Okay. So let us explain or flesh out, both theoretically and through example, taking our time, this what we are calling the [[soulmaking dynamic]]. So we have said that [[eros]] wants connection. Actually I used to define it that way: eros wants connection with the other, with the erotic object, with the beloved other. Now, whether that other is an actual person, as I said, in one's life who one has a certain kind of relationship with or some kinds of relationship (does not have to fall into one category there), certain kinds of relationship that allow this [[imaginal]] dimension, these imaginal [[Dimensionality|dimensions]], whether it is that or it is a purely so-called [[Image|intrapsychic image]], I used to say eros wants connection with the other. But that word, connection, it occurred to me that actually, especially in our circles, our kind of circles, people who are sort of psychotherapeutically versed or spiritually versed, et cetera, it is in a way lost its power. It is so used, that word, connection, "I just want to connect with you" or "I felt really connected" and this and that, in a way it is kind of lost a lot of its power and potential as a word. ^4-2
###### 4-3
So we can add some other words. [[Eros]] wants connection, it wants contact, it wants intimacy, it wants touching, to touch the beloved other, the erotic object, and to be touched by. So already with those words - connection, contact, intimacy, touching - they each have already, they are quite pregnant words, they already have quite a range. So try and hear these with sort of like - let the words themselves also expand. Because we say "to be touched" means also to be moved, that the heart is moved, but touching also involves the [[Embodiment|body]], it is embodied, it is involving the body, whether that is [[imaginal]] body or the actual physical body or whatever. And then on top of that, we can touch with all the senses. The eyes touch, there is the touch of sounds, there is the touch certainly of the hands, but actually all the senses are involved, and of course touch is a sexual word as well. ^4-3
###### 4-4
So connection, contact, intimacy, touching and being touched, penetrating we have already said, opening to, receiving. And again, really see if you can hear these words in all the sort of full potentiality of the range of what they can mean. Sometimes, especially in our circles, with all the openness that we have - heart openness and that kind of thing - the actual words kind of get [[Constriction|constrained]], for instance just around heart or something like that, or connection, the very idea gets a little constrained. So if it is possible to hear these words with more of a range in them. ^4-4
###### 4-5
So [[eros]] wants all that, but Eros, classically in Greek mythology, Eros is - I do not know about always, but often, let us say, or always, or we could say often [laughs] because it depends on whether we are doing the small definition or the big definition. But let us say Eros is accompanied by two other gods, Pothos and Himeros. So you have got a sort of [[Christianity|trinity]], erotic trinity called the Erotes, a little band called the Erotes. I think that is how you pronounce it. Eros, Pothos, and Himeros. I think it is Plato who says somewhere or other pothos has to do with what is not so much present but what is absent. It is the yearning, the longing for what is absent. But in our case, particularly what is not yet here. We will come back to that. ^4-5
###### 5-1
And himeros, again, Plato I think explains, himeros, in Greek, the word is related to the word for stream and the word for rushing, the way a stream rushes - we say the rushing of a stream. So there is a stream of [[soul]]. It is part of this soul movement. So this pothos and himeros accompany [[eros]]. Now, what does that mean? Pothos is always wanting more. It accompanies eros. So we say that eros is always accompanied by this wanting more, and what is not yet here. So it wants something further, wider, beyond what has been already reached or met or encountered or known or achieved. And so because of this, because of the pothos that always goes with eros, there is an endlessly dynamic quality or aspect, facet, to eros. Eros is endlessly dynamic in its thrusting, its penetration, its opening, its embracing movement. So it is a movement with the himeros and this pothos, eros is a movement that is endlessly dynamic. It will always want more. ^5-1
###### 5-2
So we can see, as I already said in the glossary, [[eros]] is a kind of [[desire]]. It is one kind of desire. ^5-2
###### 5-3
Actually it is a whole group of [[Desire|desires]] that are erotic. But it is a kind of desire that always is related with the [[imaginal]] or involves the imaginal. [[Eros]] is a kind of desire that always involves the imaginal. And it wants, eros wants, eros is a desire to know, to [[experience]] the other, the object, the [[image]], more deeply, more widely, more sensitively, more finely and subtly as well as grossly, the kinds of more obvious intimacy and knowing as well as really developing more and more subtlety in that knowing, meeting, touching, connecting, penetrating, opening to, receiving of the image, of the object, whatever it is, and to know it and experience it more completely and more fully. So there is, as I said, this movement to keep thrusting, to keep opening. ^5-3
###### 5-4
Now, in this movement, it is a movement, if you like, into the [[imaginal]], and [[eros]] penetrates the imaginal, if you like, and inseminates it, or opens to it and is inseminated itself by the imaginal, by [[psyche]]. It fertilizes the imaginal, the soil, if you like, the territory of the imaginal. And so there is an increase in what we are calling psyche, or there is an increase in the [[image]] - there is a swelling, a tumescence, a growing of something, not so much as images getting carried sort of... the way daydreaming, one thing kind of leads to another, and they just get carried away. But there is an increase of the sort of sense of the richness of the imaginal object. It gains in imaginal richness, in complexity, the way let us say a piece of paper or fold of cloth gains more when you crunch it up and it has all these folds in it. ... That actually does not work because I was going to say it gains more surface area, but. Maybe it does. I do not know. I have to think about the mathematics. Anyway. There is an increase of the [[dimensionality]], the aspects or folds, the faces of the beloved other, the particularities. It is almost like we discover more particularities there, more richness, more complexity, a widening of who they are, what this thing is that is the beloved object or other, the imaginal object. They become wider and deeper. They contain more, more dimensions. ^5-4
###### 5-5
And in that, the idea, the [[logos]], or with that, the logos is also pushed on. Because if I am regarding let us say a person in my life, and I am regarding him or her this way - could be whatever my relationship with them there - and they become alive for me in this erotic [[imaginal]] way, and there is all the [[beauty]] of that, and they gain [[dimensionality]], and I see, for instance, an aspect of how they are, a [[Divinity|theophany]], how their being and the very particulars of their being and their expression and their actions for me is a theophany and it is somehow, let us say, a face of God, not separate from God, how somehow they are tied in with the manifestation of [[Buddha-nature]] and divinity in really particular ways. So not just the fact of, "Oh, yeah, everything is [[love]]," as we said before, "Everything is [[awareness]], therefore it is Buddha-nature." But really through their particularities, through their [[personhood]], through this exact way that they are [[Perception|appearing]] to me in a new way. ^5-5
###### 5-6
So then, because I am seeing all that and sensing it, it is having an impact on the [[psyche]], the idea I have of not just who this person is but who any person is, the idea of a [[Personhood|human being]], the [[logos]] of a human being, is pushed on, is stretched. And potentially at least, it starts to expand to include the idea that a human being is somehow not just a biological mechanism, et cetera, complex as that is, marvelous as that is, but is also, at the same time and wrapped up in that, intricately involved in that, is also a [[Divinity|theophany]]. And the idea of what theophany is and the relationship of the divine and the human and the [[soul]], all that gets expanded as well, potentially at least. So that through this thrusting and opening of [[eros]] the [[image]], the psyche, is expanded, and also the logos is expanded in relation to this object and maybe in relation to others as well, as we will come back to. ^5-6
###### 6-1
And because they are now more yummy, more complex, more rich, have more facets, more refractions of light from the different facets of the jewel that they are are revealed to me, then that entices, it elicits, it evokes more [[eros]], an increase in the eros. So the whole thing, [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos]] - eros inseminates [[psyche]] and [[logos]], and the larger, fuller, more complex and beautiful psyche and logos inflame eros further. So you get this kind of inflating, self-fertilizing, mutually-fertilizing dynamic. I was going to say snowball effect but that does not strike me as a good metaphor. But that kind of movement, the way they feed each other, and the whole thing gets more and more fecund, and expands and widens and deepens. ^6-1
###### 6-2
So you could say we discover more, I discover more in my beloved. I discover more [[Dimensionality|dimensions]], more faces, more theophanies, all of that. And at the same time, we acknowledge that, well, I am creating that. The [[psyche]] is creating it. So we will come back to this, and I have mentioned it already. The whole process, psyche creates/discovers more to the object, more to the beloved other. And this process, this expanding sort of mutually fertilizing dynamic, widening, deepening, enriching, complicating, et cetera, it does not happen all at once. It happens over time. And it is not at all necessarily smooth in the sense that it happens usually in - I mean, it must happen in stages. It inevitably happens in stages. It happens in time in the sense that something opens and we are taken with that, we are exploring that, and there is an expansion to that level, and then we are with that for a while, and there is [[beauty]] there, and at some point it grows again (potentially, at least). So there is stages. It is not smooth in that sense. And it can also be not smooth in the sense that it can be, this whole dynamic, this whole movement, can be blocked or diverted. So we will come back to that, as I said, later, and what can happen there. ^6-2
###### 6-3
But if it is unimpeded, then also notice there is not ever any completely knowing, completely penetrating, completely opening to. We never fully know or penetrate or open to, receive the beloved other, the object, whatever it is, inanimate object or an object in nature, of nature, or another, or an [[Image|intrapsychic image]]. We never completely or fully know it, open to it, et cetera. There is no finality possible to our knowing. This creating/discovering is potentially infinite, driven by the pothos, always more, always more, always more. Or the himeros, if we want to use that, the flowing, the onward flowing. ^6-3
###### 6-4
So in that, what we are also going to add is it is not just the object that gets amplified, extended, widened, deepened, complicated, made sacred, discovered/created. Because subject and object are always mutually dependent arisings, they always go together, it is not just the object, but the subject, [[the self]] as well, is subject to this same process. It is caught up in the same web. It is involved, it turns with the same movement. So not just the object is given [[dimensionality]], or its dimensionality is revealed or discovered, and its [[Beauty|beauties]] and complexities and all that given to it or discovered in it. Not just the object, but we ourselves. The [[Imaginal|imaginal sense]] of the self is also expanded in just the same way. Everything that I said in relation to the object applies to the sense of self, the imaginal sense of self in that moment, as that is happening. It is not always obvious to people, and sometimes it gets missed, and there is consequences to that so we will come back to that. ^6-4
###### 6-5
But again, subject and object always go together, and another thing that goes together with all that is the world, the larger sort of [[perception]]. Not just the perception of the object and of [[the self]] (so self and other), but also world. So all this goes, just by virtue of the [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]] of perception, self-other-world always get [[Fabrication|fabricated]] together. So that depending on the [[eros]] and the kind of eros and how that is fabricating imaginally, there will be a self-other-world constellation. They get co-constellated, self-other-world. Actually we could say self-other-world-eros. So we are going to come back to this. But all of them, if you like, [[psyche]] and [[logos]] and eros is expanded and deepened and widened, enriched, all of that, with all of these - with other, with self, with world, self-other-world, and with eros itself. So that eventually they, too, in this sort of process, in stages, eventually they, too, are felt, are seen to have more [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] and eventually [[divinity]]. And this is where we were talking about the [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]] comes from. You work with an [[image]] and it spills out into the perception of the world. Why? Because there is the object, and there is the eros with the object, and self and world will be tied in, woven into that [[imaginal]] co-constellation inevitably because they are part of that four part co-constellation. Yeah? We will revisit all this. Okay? ^6-5
###### 7-1
Now, we could say [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos]] are separate things, and we could talk about them like we talked about [[eros]] in the sort of small definition. We could say, and I said this before, you know, eros really implies and involves that whole eros-psyche-logos dynamic, the whole soulmaking dynamic. There is a way we can also say that eros, [[psyche]], and [[logos]] - eros, [[image]], and concept if you like; or eros, image and idea - are aspects of psyche, they are aspects of [[soulmaking]]. They are not really separate. And again, we will revisit this. But image and idea are not really separate, and image actually always involves ideas, plural, so they are not really separate. ^7-1
###### 7-2
Now, we could ask, what does the [[eros]] [[desire]]? What does it want to touch, to know, to penetrate and open to, exactly? What is the other? Whether it is a purely [[Image|intrapsychic image]] or, as I said, an actual person or an actual thing or object or some thing in nature or an animal or whatever, what does the eros want to touch, know, penetrate and open to exactly there? The object that it desires is in fact image and idea. It is [[psyche]] and [[logos]]. Eros wants psyche and logos. This is another way of kind of thinking about what is going on. It is actually - the object is made up, if you like, the nature of the object is that it is psyche and logos, it is image and idea. You understand? So even if I am talking about a flesh and blood person, and I am in a certain relationship to them that allows this, or one of the kinds of relationship that allows this kind of [[Ways of Looking|way of seeing]] them, gives it permission, the object, my beloved other, is image and idea wrapped up with flesh and blood reality, so to speak. ^7-2
###### 7-3
Someone might say, "But what about the real object as it is, as it really is? What about the object as it really is?" To which, at this point, you know what the response is. The response to that question, "What about the real object, the object as it really is?", is "Hahahahahahaha!" [laughs] Right? Always there is a concept, there is [[logos]] involved in any [[perception]]. I have said this so many times. If there really is not any conception involved in perception, there wo not be any perception. There will be a [[Emptiness|fading]]. Why? Because concept is part of [[Ignorance|avijja]]. Okay? So "the object as it is," mmm, problem with [[realism]] there, okay? And I am not going to go into all that again, to do with emptiness and the absence of inherent existence and things. ^7-3
###### 7-4
Another way of saying all this could be that perhaps actually what [[eros]] wants is more [[psyche]]. ^7-4
###### 7-5
[[Eros]] wants [[psyche]], and it is endlessly, if you like, desiring psyche. And there is the myth. Some of you will know the myth of the [[love]] of Eros and Psyche, the love between Eros and Psyche. Eventually they get incorporated into the pantheon of gods. But we could say in all this, from a theoretical perspective, what is eros wanting in all this? We could phrase it a few different ways, and one of the ways is because the object is psyche and [[logos]], and because logos, idea, is wrapped up with [[image]] anyway, and the object is image and idea, that is really psyche. Eros wants [[soul]], yes? And it wants image, it wants [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]], it wants the ideas and the concepts and the images that are fecund and beautiful, you know. Eros wants psyche. It wants more and more psyche. Another way of saying all this is the soul loves [[soulmaking]]. The soul has an erotic [[desire]] for soulmaking. The soul desires soulmaking. So there is different ways of kind of explaining all this. But in a way, they are just different ways of saying the same thing. ^7-5
###### 7-6
So let us look at that dynamic with a few examples and things and talk a bit more about it, take our time and look at it in both [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]] and in life, and with different kinds of erotic objects, beloved others, if you like. So if we start with so-called purely intrapsychic imaginal practice - actually, I do not know - if we start with imaginal practice, you can see that the [[eros]] is, as I said, sometimes explicitly sexual, obviously sexual, and sometimes not. So let us start with the sexual. Partly, as I said, because partly what I want to do in these talks is to open up the sexual, open up that doorway of the sexual, and kind of, yeah, legitimize, sanction it. So again, we have said before, the sexual is not equivalent with the erotic; it is one, if you like, one face of the erotic. So when we say erotic, we do not, as has now become common parlance, mean sexual. The sexual and sexual [[Image|images]] are just one way, or sexual action in life, is just one way of knowing, experiencing, contacting, connecting, opening, penetrating, et cetera. It is just one way, one, if you like, strand or thread of the erotic movement. ^7-6
###### 8-1
So we have said that several times, but at the same time, it is not interchangeable with another way. In other words, it is not like, "Oh, I am not sure about the sexual. Rob's saying it is just about knowing, experiencing, contact, so let me just replace it with another kind of knowing." You can do that if you want. But I would not at all assume that they are interchangeable, the types, the strands of [[eros]], okay? Let us linger with this for a while. You know, sex - and we will come back to this - and sexual [[Image|images]] are not, I would say, they cannot be reduced, we cannot assume that they are, for instance, just expressing [[love]], and that is what sex is, and that is what this or that sexual image is just expressing love, or it is just wanting union, to melt together into [[oneness]]. Or, certainly, that it is just a [[desire]] for pleasant sensations. So sex, and maybe sexual images, can be that those are the primary things involved, but it is actually much more involved, I think, with what is driving [[sexuality]] and what is generating sexual images, if you like. ^8-1
###### 8-2
So I'd be cautious of narrowing it down that way and assuming. And again, [[spiritual circles]], these kinds of ideas about [[sexuality]] are very common - an expression of [[love]], or it is wanting [[oneness]] and union, or it is just a seeking of pleasure. Remember something from previous courses about the specificity of [[Image|images]]. Images are very, very specific. So if we reduce them, they lose their specificity. "This image, with all its particular nuances and details of it and very particular ways it was felt and sensed, it can be replaced just by an idea of, Oh, it was wanting union or it was a movement towards oneness or something like that." The specificity of images is something really, really important. So it is not just the sexual is just one way of knowing. I mean, it is true, but it is also the image wants this way that it generates. The image shows this way, whatever this way is, this particular way of penetrating, of opening, of intercourse in the larger sense of intercourse. This expression of [[eros]] is being shown in the image. This is what the image wants. ^8-2
###### 8-3
So there is a principle here that I have touched on in previous [[Retreat|retreats]] about just trusting, if you like, the intelligence of the [[soul]], the intelligence of the dynamism of the soul. And sometimes that is hard to generate. We will come back to this. But just playing with a little bit of trust nourishes the process. So it is very specific, the [[Image|images]] are specific, and they are not just reducible, interchangeable, or one kind of [[eros]] with another, et cetera. Okay? ^8-3
###### 8-4
And if we extend that point, you also see that implied in that idea is the exact specificity of the sexual [[image]], because we are talking now about sexual images, starting with that. What you will notice, I think inevitably, if you really do these practices and you really open to this and you explore them in the ways that we are talking about, with [[mindfulness]], with sensitivity, with [[awareness]] of the [[energy body]], with noticing the [[soul]] resonances and all of that that we have described in what we consider [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]], how we are defining it, you will find that often - maybe not all the time, but often - the images, an erotic image that might come up, whatever it is, and be what you are meditating with, is what I like to say is sufficient unto itself. So there might be a particular activity, sexual interaction or communication or relationship going on - and this is true for all images, you know, whether they are sexual or not - but it is sufficient unto itself. ^8-4
###### 8-5
There is some particular activity [[Embodiment|embodied]], manifested in the [[image]] itself that is, if you like, intrinsic to the image, okay? That means it does not, in the usual way that images, like "one thing leads to the next" as they say, for life and also with images, this happens and then that happens and one thing led to the next, et cetera. There is a kind of sufficiency unto itself that is part of what the image kind of wants, its intelligence. So it is not that you are working in [[meditation]] and something erotic arises, something sexual, and then there is this kind of progression or escalation to, say, genital intercourse or orgasm or whatever. It does not have that kind of escalation necessarily at all - in fact, quite rarely. There is something about just - it is just that, whatever that is. Of course, that might be genital intercourse. But it does not have this escalatory kind of propulsion to it. Nor, certainly, does it imply at all or propel one to concretize that action in any way in the world. So we have been through all this anyway in regard to [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]], but remember that in relation to sexual images as well. ^8-5
###### 9-1
So yes, the pothos and the himeros, the always wanting more and the stream, the onward rushing stream, will give rise, will, as I said, impregnate the [[imaginal]], will impregnate [[psyche]] and fertilize the [[Image|images]], but that fertilization is a deepening, an enrichening, a giving dimension to and discovering dimension in the image. It is not in the same way that sort of unmindful daydreaming just sort of, as I said, leads one thing onto another, or [[fantasy]] in the way that it is usually meant, being lost in sexual fantasy or whatever in the poor meaning of the term. It is not that kind of wanting more and rushing on that way. So if we go back to again things from other [[Retreat|retreats]] that you have listened to. There is [[Stories|narrative]] images where the whole thing seems to progress in time in this kind of narrative way, "This happened, then this happened"; there is a sort of either aimlessness to it or a kind of purposive narrative, "This thing happens and then it is great because this next thing was able to happen and this next thing and whoopee!" So that is usually, not always, but that is usually a telltale sign that the ego has gotten involved and it is spinning a narrative usually towards some kind of triumphant thing or to collect something or something like that. Or towards doom. ^9-1
###### 9-2
But this is in contrast, [[Stories|narrative]] [[Image|images]] are in contrast to what we call the [[imaginal]] or iconic images where there is a quality that we can notice of [[eternality]] or [[Unfabricated|timelessness]] to them. They are more characterized by that. Same with the sexual imaginal, the erotic imaginal. They do not move in time towards some great "whoopee!" necessarily. So again, it is something to do with the integrity, if you like, and the intelligence of the image, that they do not necessarily escalate, and often they do not escalate in that sort of more common way. They also, again, if we are with this idea of the integrity and the intelligence, specificity of an image, you will notice as you play with these kinds of practices more and more, and with the [[energy body]], et cetera, that images have what we might call their own specific register or wavelength of [[Perception|appearance]] or [[energy]]. I can not remember if I have said this on other [[Retreat|retreats]]. I think I have. I am almost certain I have. ^9-2
###### 9-3
So in other words, one could have a sexual [[image]] arise that one's working with in [[meditation]] and it could be very, very ethereal. The forms, the bodies involved, are just sort of light bodies, maybe of different colors. It is all very kind of insubstantial. The resonances with the [[energy body]] and the tangible [[perception]] of the image is towards the insubstantial end of the [[energy]] bodies. Or it can be very substantial, just feels and looks really solid and earthy and fleshy and very substantial. That whole range is available and you will notice again - you can play with it, because you can actually learn to modulate the register of an image. But it seems to me that again the images have a certain kind of integrity and intelligence in their specificity. So if it wants to be really fleshy and solid, that is what it somehow wants to be, and not to just immediately want to make it ethereal or the other way around, okay? So this is not always simple as a subject; depends on the person and stuff, but we are saying something here about trusting the specificity of images. ^9-3
###### 9-4
And related to that, there is also a huge range in the sexual [[imaginal]], the erotic imaginal - well, in the sexual imaginal - of let us say intensity and carnality, if you like, of lust and wildness. So there is no better or worse with these ranges. Something that seems like really lusty and carnal and really intense in its [[sexuality]], really wild, let us say, is not better or worse or less spiritual or whatever than something that is very, very sort of gentle and ethereal and very, you know, what it expresses of sexuality is quite sort of subtle, even. So no better or worse there. It is really what is the intelligence of this [[image]] and can I just play with the idea of trusting that, assuming that there is an intelligence there and going with it and seeing that in the specificity that is offered, that the image offers. ^9-4
###### 10-1
So just to give you a sense of the range here. An [[image]], meditating quite some years ago, and just a couple - I did not quite know who the couple was. And they are just in a sort of path in a forest, and all that is happening is they are holding hands. And it is a relatively brief image, but there was something in the holding hands. There was [[eros]] there in the hands. It was - I can not remember, let us see - yeah, it was not so much that the bodies were subtle; I think they were just fleshy bodies. But there was something very subtle in what was passing between them, let us say, in the erotic movement through the handholding. It was very, very subtle. Certainly not x-rated, you know. It is like really, really subtle. This is an erotic [[Imaginal|imaginal image]], okay? Did not have - it was not particularly insubstantial, but it was very subtle and very kind of gentle. There was something about tenderness, lovely, that was actually really palpable, the [[love]], the softness, the tenderness that passed between them through, if you like, the handholding. So really, you know, almost one could neglect it as an image. But I want to give you a sense of the range and this sense of really trusting the intelligence and the specificity of the image. So it might be something like holding hands. And notice in this case it was not even that I was involved. I was witnessing another couple. ^10-1
###### 10-2
Then another [[image]] might be, or kind of erotic image, might be - again this is an image that came to me - it was kind of like a celestial wedding. That is the sense of it that I saw. And again, there was a couple there. It was like I was witnessing something. And this couple were sort of dancing with each other in sort of almost like a formulaic ritual way, and there were kind of columns with garlands around them, and they were dancing in and out of the columns, and again touching hands and holding hands. The whole thing had this very light quality, but something really delicate and beautiful and celebratory, like I was witnessing this union, almost like at another level, a celestial union. And the whole thing felt very light. It was very luminous and very light as in not heavy as well, but it was not particularly insubstantial in the sense they were flesh and blood bodies, this couple, this bridal couple, and not sort of bodies of light. ^10-2
###### 10-3
And actually something similar I remember. Maybe I will tell this one in a bit more detail. The reason for telling all these is just because of what they might give examples of that will help you in your practice. So I will give this one in a bit more detail. I sat down to meditate one day, a couple of years ago I think it was. And there was actually a lot of distraction, distracting [[Image|images]] - that is right, I'd seen a movie the night before, I cannot remember what, and was just noticing, oh, yeah, you see a movie and the images from the movie stay in the [[mind]] and they kind of dominate for a while, for a day or two even, especially if you do not see many movies like I do not. So it was taking a while to sort of start and kind of filter, "Does that have this [[Imaginal|imaginal sense]] to it, or has the mind just kind of been impressed upon by something?" Now, it could be that an image from a movie becomes imaginal for me. Certainly that happens many times. Or an image, a character in a book becomes imaginal for me. So it is not that a priori an image from a movie is not to be followed. But there was a sense, just kind of like feeling the waters, fishing around a bit, what is kind of genuinely imaginal here, has that quality to it that I might actually tune in on. ^10-3
###### 10-4
Then actually - I do not know how long, a little time it took the [[mind]] to sort of settle with that. ^10-4
###### 10-5
And then an [[image]] that I'd actually had before, it was quite a common one for me, of a young man, relatively young man, alone in a prison cell. There is a sort of spiraling stone staircase down into a dark cellar, and that is his prison cell. I can see that - I am sort of traveling down that staircase to where he is in his prison cell, and there is a tiger that appears beside me and beside that young man. So I am somehow moving in and out of identifying with him. At this point I am just finding my way into the image. And the tiger, too, was a very common image for me at that time. And this tiger has a very powerful, very kind of calm and silent [[energy]] to it, with immense power. ^10-5
###### 10-6
So I descend into this cellar and I notice that actually the top of the stairs admit light. So this is interesting. I look up and I think it is actually open. So this is doubly interesting - the prison is somehow actually optional. And as I go kind of into the cellar, I see that it is peopled - there are various characters there. It is not just this young man. There is a sort of wizard character who I think I'd, again, a character that I'd encountered before, with certain characteristics we do not need to go into here. And there is also a kind of beautiful lady in white, again a character with other characteristics we do not need to go into here. So interestingly - and again, I am still describing how I am getting into the [[image]]; I am still not sure what to focus on here. And I focus on her for a while, and her [[Perception|appearance]] keeps changing as I focus on, and kind of mixing with images from the film that I saw. And then doubt arises. I am not sure is this right, what is happening. So I am describing all this just to - we are going to talk about practice of course and doubt and all that, but just kind of, in a way, to paint a picture of what actually happens. ^10-6
###### 11-1
So what I did at that point was I went a little deeper into the sense of [[samadhi]] in the [[energy body]]. Remember, all this is connected with that. So okay, the [[mind]] can not really settle here on what to connect with as an [[image]], so let us just go deeper into the samadhi sense and feel the subtle body, the energy body. And in doing that, sometimes what can happen with the energy body, and maybe it happens with some people more than others, it is as if the energy body sort of begins to float free of the [[Embodiment|physical body]]. So this is not anything at all to do with being disconnected from the body - there is still this real sense of being really intimate with the feeling in the body, but it is as if the subtle body floats free and sort of flies free of the body. You can feel it flying and oftentimes for me it wants to turn cartwheels or somersaults; there is a kind of exuberant [[Happiness|joy]] in it. ^11-1
###### 11-2
So I can really feel that very palpably in the [[energy]] field of the [[Embodiment|body]], and I also see it, and it is kind of blue and a kind of white-yellow light. And it feels really good, and [[Happiness|joy]] arises with that. So sometimes for some people it is related to, a possibility that arises, with a certain amount of [[samadhi]]. This feels good and joy arises with it, and then it is almost like I am seeing this subtle-bodied [[Daimon|angel]], if you like, but I am no longer really identifying so much. There is a kind of - definitely not 100% am this subtle-bodied angel. This subtle-bodied angel and the beautiful woman who was there, and she also now has a more [[Energy Body|subtle body]] of light. So what happened, as I went into the energy body, more samadhi, followed this energy body movement, it started to change the [[image]]. There is that [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]], mutual dependent arising of energy body, [[mind]]-state and image, and we are acknowledging all that. ^11-2
###### 11-3
But this subtle-bodied [[Daimon|angel]] and the beautiful woman with the [[Embodiment|body]] of light, they start to dance. ^11-3
###### 11-4
But dance is really... it is sort of the best I can do as a word for what they are doing. They are somehow floating and interacting with each other in such a sort of movement of delight. There is so much delight and mutual sort of sympathy and resonance in the way their movements kind of reflect and respond to each other and work together. It is, yeah, very hard to describe in words, but they were full of delight, and the whole scene was full of delight, and it delighted me. There was a lot of [[Happiness|joy]] in this. Also want to mention that as this was happening, the thinking [[mind]] started sort of flashing lots of [[Insight|insights]] very, very quickly and intuitively. It was not, like, pondering something, just lots of very quick flashes of intuitive insight around [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]] and other stuff. This was quite a few years ago and I was still developing this material and things were occurring to me. Note also there that there is a way that the thinking mind can be drawn into this process in really quite a creative way as part of this. ^11-4
###### 11-5
Now, the whole thing, I am witnessing this erotic interaction, this intercourse in the widest possible sense, but it is really not raunchy sexual at all; it is very ethereal for a start, and what they are really doing is just moving in this way together, dancing if you call it that, in these sort of bodies of light. And it really feels like a vision of another realm where these two, this couple, are somehow eternally in this erotic dance together. So somehow I am sort of, if you like, given a vision or an opening into this other realm, and that is what it feels like. When I, in the [[meditation]], as it was going on over quite a little while, when I feel like I am losing touch with that world, I just, "Oh, it is kind of going a bit," so I went back to this [[Energy Body|subtle body sense]] of feeling like the subtle body was flying, the actual feeling of that, and turning cartwheels and floating and really feeling how that feels. And again, that feeling in the energy body, very palpable, very lovely and enjoyable, helped me to access that kind of realm or world again, the vision of that. ^11-5
###### 12-1
So yes, imagining, if you like, the [[Energy Body|subtle body]] floating and flying through the air of the room, because then I could also kind of transport it from that cellar to the room that I was in, the room at [[Gaia House]], and imagining the subtle body, that I am feeling it, so [[image]] and energy body interacting there, and allowed that whole sense to come back, that whole image to open up again, of the couple. Just tracing that again as an example, very insubstantial, if we go back to this range of what is possible. Insubstantial. What can we say? Sexual, yeah, but a very gentle way, you know, and really not - certainly not obviously genital or even anything like that. Many times, you know, sitting in [[meditation]], and it is as if a deva or a [[dakini]] or an [[Daimon|angel]] comes and kisses me on the heart. This has a really [[healing]], soothing effect. Very beautiful, very delicate, very loving. But so specific in the qualities of this angel and the way the kiss is given and the effect, its ripple through the energy body, sometimes very characterized by tenderness or by humor or by mischievous playfulness and sort of seductive quality or whatever. But so many possibilities in the specificity. The range is huge. ^12-1
###### 12-2
Or you might get an [[image]] from - you may know this Tibetan word, yab-yum, the sort of icons of buddhas in erotic union, in sexual union with their consorts. You get a different [[buddha]] with his specific [[Dakini|consort]], the consort with the buddha in erotic union, right at the center of a mandala or a thangka or whatever. So that would be quite a common image to arise in [[meditation]]. Again, who is it? Who is it who is involved? What is the characteristics of that yab-yum, of that penetration, of that opening? It may well be a melting, there is in that melting, maybe characterized by a lot of tenderness that goes with the melting, or tenderness melts together. It may be that it starts insubstantial, becomes insubstantial, just melts into light, that what started as two figures just becomes a melting into some color of light, and the figures and their independence and their forms are dissolved in that light. So all kinds of possibilities here. ^12-2
###### 12-3
It may be, you know, that there are [[Image|images]] and [[imaginal]] senses of different kinds, involving the different imaginal senses, of penetration. So sexual penetration, actually all kinds of - let us say erotic penetration, because it can even be penetration through the gaze, and this is something we will come back to. What is it to feel penetrated by the gaze of an imaginal figure? What is it to feel their gaze penetrating you in the erotic union that is through the gaze? But there can be all kinds of penetration, all different ways, and they do not at all need to correspond to or even at all be [[Constriction|constrained]] by any kind of anatomical, biological accuracy. You or an imaginal figure might, for instance, have five penises, for example. There is a statue of Hermes that I saw somewhere that indeed had five penises. You can penetrate or feel penetrated in more than one place at the same time, something that is obviously not biologically possible, maybe in the middle of your head or the middle of the imaginal figure's head, or in through the front of the throat. Or it can feel or seem in different ways, again, different senses involved, that the [[Embodiment|whole body]] is being penetrated. Again, it does not make biological, anatomical sense. ^12-3
###### 12-4
There can certainly be gender reversal. So I am used to thinking of myself as a man or a woman or something else I define myself as, but there is no constraint or stasis necessarily in terms of gender identities in the [[imaginal]] realm. And even with gender, there is no necessarily clear visual sense that corresponds to gender necessarily. There might be and there might not be. Penetration, as I said, might have more to do with [[energy]] penetrating - might. It might not be; it might be very carnal, very physical, and very conforming to human anatomy. Might. Certainly homoerotic. The range is enormous. It could be a penetration of being, beingness, you know? What is that? The imaginal is not, as I said, [[Constriction|constrained]] to any kind of gender identity that we are used to. Could be hermaphroditic, you know. The sexual orientations that we are usually identified with, if we are identified, that holds no sway in the imaginal realm. There is some other intelligence operating that, if you like, just breaks that open, does not feel limited, is not limited by that. ^12-4
###### 12-5
So there is all these possibilities. Let me describe another one. Some of these [[Image|images]] actually, and this one in particular, it has a slightly different context. So there is bits that I will leave out, and bits that kind of have connotations that wo not be clear from what I am saying. But I think for the purposes of right now, it serves. So I am in [[meditation]] and I see myself or I feel myself on a large raft. There is a whole kind of cast of other characters on this raft with me, a large, wooden, flat raft that is on the sea and kind of drifting on the sea. Some of the characters are familiar from other images I had worked with in the past, that had sort of come and visited me, and some were completely new, did not recognize them from before. Some of them were very clear, and some were just vague presences, I couldn't even quite get a sense of them or picture of them or any other sense of them. ^12-5
###### 13-1
Not only that, at first the number of figures there - there is clearly quite a few of them, but exactly how many, that seemed to be changeable more or less, and not even necessarily a finite number potentially. And the individuals themselves could change; they hadn't kind of settled down. And then it seemed like, suddenly it seemed like the raft was like a theatre stage, and it was being lit up. So it was on the ocean, this big, flat, wooden raft, being lit up, this that was now felt like a theatre stage, being lit up by sort of intense flashes of lightning, very sort of dramatic lightning coming from the heavens as if from God or something. So that this stage, this theatre stage, was illumined, illuminated by the lightning, this period lightning, whereas the water around it was not. So the water around it was black, dark. And suddenly with all that, tremendous [[energy]] with the [[image]], shoots of energy. And then on this raft, on this theatre stage at sea, illuminated by the lightning, a rite begins. And there is a woman there. She is mostly naked. A kind of dark woman, mostly naked, but her [[Embodiment|body]], her mostly naked body, is daubed in splashes and strokes of kind of black paint or tar or something. And she has amulets around her upper arms. And she is full of vital energy and force. She is exuding this vital energy and force. ^13-1
###### 13-2
And a rite begins between her and me. It is watched by the other characters. So it is as if they form a circle, watching this rite. And what happens in the rite, unlike some rites, is not formulaic. It is more improvised. And it is part dance and part sex, basically, and part what I would describe as different acts of union. There is a lot of [[energy]] involved, and the energy is quite, if you like, dark and powerful, but I do not mean by dark evil. We have been through this, I think, in the Re-enchanting [[retreat]] and possibly other retreats. Dark in my language is not evil at all, as most people tend to think in terms of certain archetypes. She is a dark goddess, and it is very, very beautiful, but she is not someone like Kali who is a sort of overwhelming, primordial, destructive force of nature. She is very powerful, and she is a dark goddess, but it is not that kind of completely decimatingly destructive force that I think goes with the goddess Kali, although I am not quite sure of that iconography and all that. ^13-2
###### 13-3
Now, in this rite, part of what we do, this dark goddess and I, is - I do not know if you ever did this; maybe it is a weird thing. When I was a kid, we had two friends, me and my brother had two friends who lived just up the street, and we must have been, I do not know, seven, I am guessing. Something like that. And I do not know where we got the idea from - maybe it was from, like, a TV show or something. Anyway. We cut our arms just a little bit so that they bled a little bit, and then we pressed the two bleeding arms together, me and my friend, so that we would be blood brothers. I do not know - have you heard of this? I honestly can not remember where we got it from, but it must have been some TV thing or something like that. And what that was was really, for us, back then when we were kids, it was symbolic of our friendship and our kind of commitment. I felt I really loved these guys and we were buddies and we were always out on the street playing or riding to the park and stuff, and it was kind of like symbolic of our deep commitment to each other as friends. ^13-3
###### 13-4
So that is part of what happens in this rite with this dark goddess on the raft, is we cut our arms and we press the bleeding parts together to become blood friends, if you like, or related. It is a symbol of our deep commitment to each other and commitment to something - I am not even quite sure in the [[image]] what. This image was something I returned to a few times, and I was experimenting at the time with the whole notion of pacing with images, like when to return, when to deliberately return to a certain element of it, when to just move on to another image, et cetera. I think, I hope I talked about that in past [[Retreat|retreats]]. And when I returned to it at some stage later, either the next day or later that day, I can not remember, we do this rite again, and her blood is actually black. She has black blood. And I receive this black blood of hers into my veins. Then I went out for some [[Meditation|walking meditation]] - I was on retreat at the time - and this kind of infusion of her black blood into my veins just filled my [[Embodiment|whole body]] with tremendous [[energy]]. ^13-4
###### 14-1
But more than that, it is like, as I was walking, it felt like that same [[energy]], that same black blood energy, was suffusing into my [[Embodiment|body]] as I was walking in the [[Meditation|walking meditation]], from nature. So she was somehow a nature goddess, and I could actually feel this in-surge of energy, this black blood in-surge from nature, suffusing my whole body, my [[Energy Body|whole energy body]]. And in doing that - so I am walking up and down, stopping and standing and walking, and being with this [[image]] in my walking meditation very mindfully - that infusion into the energy body, I actually, my [[Imaginal|imaginal sense]] of my body and the earth transformed as well through that infusion. So my energy body became a dancing god, like very sort of thickset, heavy, muscular, quite a different body than I have in this life at least. This god and my energy body - and I was still, but the energy body was dancing a sort of really energetic, powerful dance, a bit like what I know of the haka, you know, in New Zealand, the All Blacks rugby team and the dance they do trying to intimidate their opposing team before they start. It is fabulous. ^14-1
###### 14-2
So something like that, that sort of dance, was moving through my [[energy body]] and my imagination while the actual [[Embodiment|physical body]] was still. We have talked about these kind of possibilities in [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]] before. Other times, going back to this thread of the [[image]] that had to do with the blood mixing, other times this mixing of blood was much more gentle in terms of what it opened up. As the blood mixed, it became this merging of beings in really profound, beautiful [[love]], and a kind of softly ecstatic union. So the very same thread of the image felt very different at different times, gave rise to a different trajectory of image within the larger image. But also at other times - this is all in the same sort of constellation of image on the raft in this rite - the rite, also, this erotic rite between the dark goddess and myself, involved dismembering each other, ripping each other or chopping each other's limbs, all the limbs, chopping them off the other. So she would do that to me, I would do that to her; it does not obviously make sense anatomically, physically. Chopping all the limbs of the other off the other, and chopping their body in pieces, and laying these out on the raft, these limbs and body pieces, and then smearing one's one body with the parts and the dismembered limbs of the other. So one's own body becomes daubed in the blood of the other. And then feasting, devouring the limbs and the flesh of the other. ^14-2
###### 14-3
Why am I saying all this? [laughs] To give you a sense of the range. Clearly that [[image]], for a start, was not insubstantial at all. It was very substantial, very carnal, very intense, and for a lot of people, they think, "That just sounds weird or pathological" or whatever. But actually there was a lot that came out of that image, tremendous amount in fact, that I am not going to go into now, infused with holiness, infused with [[beauty]]. Is it the standard kind of picture of holiness and beauty? No, it is not. Am I ever going to chop anyone up and do all that? [laughs] Of course I am not. But really what I want to do is give you a sense of - the whole point of just these examples was to open up the sense of, as I said, the possible [[manifestations]] of [[eros]], in this case of sexually erotic imagery, [[imaginal]]. ^14-3
###### 14-4
So we come back to this question. What does the [[image]] want? What does the image want? Can I trust, if you like, the integrity and intelligence of images? Or if I can even just grant them a little bit of trust, trusting their integrity, intelligence, what does that open up? What does that allow? What does that allow to unfold? What does that set in motion, if you like, through my trust? When I grant that and the image has this kind of iconic, timeless or eternal aspect, quality to it, dimension to it, all that and the trust allows the [[soulmaking]]. Yeah? This is part of what allows the soulmaking. So we are interested here in opening and allowing the [[eros]] so that the eros can open and allow the soulmaking and [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]] and the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]], everything that we are talking about. ^14-4
###### 14-5
Notice this granting of trust or this idea of the integrity and the intelligence of the [[image]] is a view, it is a [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]], it is a concept, it is a [[logos]], it is a [[conceptual framework]]. We are completely admitting that. It is part, as I said, of the [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]]. It is part, if you like, of our intelligence, to bring it, to bring it to bear, to play with it, knowing it is just an idea and it will have an effect. ^14-5
###### 15-1
Sometimes that is quite a subtle point and it is hard for people to kind of get their heads around. But what happens in contrast if I reduce an [[image]]? "I just had that image because clearly I was traumatized or whatever from my past, or something like that. It is an expression of my past." Or I dismiss it, "Can not possibly be interesting. Or I am lonely, therefore I see this couple holding hands," or whatever it is. If I reduce or dismiss it, what happens? Then I have a certain [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]], I have a certain view, I have a certain concept, [[logos]] operating. What happens to the whole process? It just folds, usually, usually. ^15-1
###### 15-2
So again, there is [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]] here. We are going to come back to this. What happens if I feel guilty, some kind of guilt from my upbringing or from other kinds of teachings I have received in different cultures, and I feel guilty about having a sexual [[image]] arise? That is actually interesting, what the effect of guilt - again, the guilt becomes a view, a lens, a [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]], or part of the way of looking. There is a concept built into, "This is something that I should feel guilty of, that is bad." There is a [[conceptual framework]]. It is informing, it is shaping the way of looking and the view, and that affects what happens. Guilt's an interesting one because it could inhibit the movement, the [[soulmaking]] movement. Certainly inhibit the image, so we just shut it off or bring the [[mind]] back to the tip of the nose or whatever it is that we are doing or whatever, or a different so-called spiritual practice. Or bring it back to so-called reality or whatever. Or the guilt can - and I think I have talked about this before - [[shame]] and guilt can also propel something more, and they have their place in the mechanism of what propels addiction often. Often it is the shame and the seeing of something as bad that somehow it creates an [[energy]] that is intolerable, that propels the whole process, and I just repeat the addiction because of the shame, because of the intolerability of something. It is part of the whole cycle. I have talked about that before so I am not going to dwell on it here. ^15-2
###### 15-3
But the question is, if I feel guilty, it is the opposite of trusting the intelligence of the [[image]]. ^15-3
###### 15-4
What effect does that have on then what can or does unfold? And then there is the whole question, too, and we will come back to this as well, of if there is a lot of [[energy]], a lot of sexual energy or arousal, or sometimes just a lot of agitation anyway or stress, and then sometimes sexual [[fantasy]] or actual orgasm, et cetera, is - something in the being is just seeking to discharge energy. So we will come back to that. But if that is what is propelling the whole movement, then it will go down a certain line and it will escalate, one thing leads to another. So there is a lot of different things that can come into how we are viewing the [[image]] at any time in terms of ideas, subtle ideas - sometimes we are not even conscious - or intentions or whatever, views, [[ways of looking]], and this all has an impact. Yeah? ^15-4
###### 15-5
That is enough for now, but I want to really start to go into this [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]]. ^15-5
###### 15-6
When we can relate to the [[image]] in certain ways that allow that and how it spills over, as I mentioned, into [[the self]] image, the images of self that are operating, as well as of other and world in [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]], et cetera, and other aspects of this organic movement of [[soulmaking]]. Okay? ^15-6
