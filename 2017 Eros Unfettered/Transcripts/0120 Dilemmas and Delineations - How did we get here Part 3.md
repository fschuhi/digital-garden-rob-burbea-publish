So, as I have already said, what we mean by [[eros]], the way we are using that term, is actually woven in and related to and indissolubly bound up with and connected to a whole range of other terms that we are using with specific meanings to form a kind of larger [[conceptual framework]]. There is a whole web of [[relationships]] and implied meanings there, so we can not really unpack what we mean by eros without beginning to include more of those terms and say a little about those other notions and a little bit about what the relationships are. But this whole edifice, this whole architecture, conceptual framework, is something we will unfold gradually. There is quite a lot to it, in a way. ^1-1
###### 1-2
I want to begin doing that now. And just before I do, you know, just to say - I am aware that I am referring to what is now really quite a large body of work. I think about all the work on [[emptiness]] and [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]], and [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]], and re-enchantment and all that, it is actually quite a large body of work together with this piece, this course on [[eros]]. So if someone who is coming from the [[Meditation|insight meditation]] tradition or something like that were to just pick a talk at random and listen to that talk, they would probably - well, probably be just baffled, puzzled, probably even maybe shocked, perhaps even outraged: "What is this? What is he talking about? What are they talking about? How on Earth did we get here, these words [[soul]], eros, [[divinity]], even the word God, [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]] - whatever that means? What on Earth is he talking about, and how did he get there? This is really pretty far-out. Is this [[Buddhism]]?" Now. [laughs] I have touched on that last question before. It may be, in some respects, quite an interesting question. In other respects, it might not be interesting at all. What is more interesting about it to me is why is a person asking such a question, and what assumptions and [[Fantasy|fantasies]] are operating for them, and in our language, what soul styles can we approach this material with and its relationship to, let us say, more conventional interpretations of [[Dharma]]? I have talked about that before; I am not going to repeat it here. But just to say, I would say this body of material needs listening to, studying, practicing with - all that material around the emptiness, but certainly around the imaginal material, in series. In other words, it adds up. In that way, only then can a person kind of see and understand what is meant in these teachings. ^1-2
###### 1-3
But we will also, hopefully, understand - if a person does that, listens, studies, ponders, and practices in series - that there is kind of, I would say, an almost inevitable or natural evolution of this material now. It evolved, if you like, naturally. The doors were presented one after another. The consequences, the avenues, were traveled in a kind of logical or inevitable order - one [[insight]], one opening lead to another, et cetera, all based on what we might call the [[Phenomenology|phenomenological]] approach, which is how I would base my approach to the [[Dharma]]. It is very, very simple, starting with very, very simple practices, including the ideas of [[mindfulness]], but not based on the usual assumptions. This is what makes the phenomenological approach. It is not based on the usual assumptions, but based on just what do I have as a [[Personhood|human being]]? I have [[experience]]. I have what appears to me. [[Phenomenon|Phenomena]] means [[Perception|appearance]]. And just basing it on, "This is experienced. Now what can I discover about experience?" And introducing into that very quickly - one discovers, "I can look at it this way, and I can look at it that way. I can relate to it this way, that way," so the ideas of [[ways of looking]] and [[fabrication]] eventually come out of that, because I see some ways of looking fabricate differently than others. ^1-3
###### 1-4
So all this unfolds. Very, very simple practices, just not based on the usual assumptions, just suspending them, opening them, relating to what actually is here - [[experience]] is here, [[Perception|appearance]] is here - without other assumptions. All this leads to other concepts, other ways of framing what is happening, and out of that comes a [[freedom]] and certain [[Conceptual Framework|conceptual frameworks]] or the availability to look in different ways and to conceive in different ways. If one does not understand all that, and see it through practice, almost like stage by stage, probably a person wo not understand what we are saying now in these teachings - probably; there are always exceptions, of course. Without that practice and without those [[Insight|understandings]] and those insights, there is not going to be an understanding. So that is one thing. ^1-4
###### 2-1
A second thing is, related, regarding these words like, for instance, [[soul]] or [[divinity]] or God, this is interesting, why some people react to these words. Just to point out, everyone - unless you are a real weirdo [laughs] - everyone uses the word self: I, you, self, et cetera. And everyone experiences selves. Everyone experiences selves - their own self or selves, and the selves of others. So it is just the same, or rather it is similar with the notion of divinity. We are talking about [[experience]], okay? So just as self is a word that we use, an experience, so is divinity - or rather, divinity is a whole range of experiences, a whole range of [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] of experience, if you like, that will become evident, that will appear in one's experience, if we do not block, dismiss, or rule it out. In other words, if I am closed to the very notion of it, just a priori absolutely no way, rule it out, and if I do not open my practice in a certain way, I wo not have that experience, and then it will seem like, "What are you talking about?", or "You are talking about something you are making up," or "It is not real," et cetera. ^2-1
###### 2-2
So we use the word, and we are referring to a whole range of experiences, just like self. And just like self, the experiences of [[divinity]] or [[soul]] and the ideas of it, we acknowledge just like self are historically and [[Dominant Culture|culturally contingent]]. The selves that you and I [[experience]] now and assume to be real, the kind of [[The Self|modernist self]] of Western civilization, was not in many ways at all similar to the self that the people that the [[Buddha]] was addressing 2500 years ago in India would have experienced. A lot of what we take for granted, the complexity and the kinds of [[Centre|interiority]], just did not exist for them. Same with medieval Christendom - very different. So just like self, experiences and ideas of soul or divinity are historically and culturally contingent, conditioned. We acknowledge that, absolutely. ^2-2
###### 2-3
If it seems to someone listening, if it seems like, "Okay, but one of those, [[the self]], refers to a reality and the others like [[soul]] and [[divinity]] are just [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculations. They are unnecessary, they are unreal, and they are ungrounded," well, such a bias or assumption may just be reflecting a kind of indoctrination or brainwashing, if you like. The assumptions there and the actual [[experience]] may be determined by just what is the current dominant Weltanschauung, worldview, of Western modernist society, culture. It is not so much that a person saying that has any very deep [[insight]] or radical, cutting, innovative idea. Actually, they are just adopting, indoctrinated by, the assumptions of the current dominant worldview, and their experience and their assumptions are determined by that. ^2-3
###### 2-4
[10:42] But even more than that, again, just like the word self and the notion of self and the [[experience]] of [[the self]], notions of [[soul]], God, [[divinity]], are empty in many other ways apart from just being historically and culturally conditioned and contingent. There are many ways to reveal the [[emptiness]] of the self, and on many, many different levels. I have talked and written a lot about that. The same is true of soul, God, divinity: empty in many ways and at many levels. Now, someone with a little bit of [[insight]] will say, or maybe a lot of insight will say, "I use the language self. I use that term. But I know it is empty." And again, same, same regarding divinity and soul and God, et cetera. We use the language but we know it is empty. Someone with perhaps broader insight will also say something like, "Although it is ultimately empty, it is important to respect the self and to care for the self." Okay, so there is a psychological wisdom there that is quite important, but again, just the same regarding divinity and soul: although it is ultimately empty, it is important to respect the soul - what does that mean? - and to care for the soul - what does that mean? ^2-4
###### 2-5
And we can press this a little further. If we were to ask someone, this hypothetical person who uses happily words like self, or matter (which is another almost unavoidable word), or life (some people use that quite a lot: life this and life that), and if we were to ask someone, "What do you mean when you say 'self'? What is [[the self]]? And what is matter? What do you mean by 'matter'?" At first, they would just sort of point: "Well, I mean this, or I mean that, or I mean this here." [knocks on something] Or life - they might sweep their hands around the room or around the outside or whatever. But if you just said, "Yes, but what do you mean by that?", and you kept pushing this question, probing with the question, without a doubt, it would pretty quickly reveal just how vague the notions of self, certainly the notions of life, and even matter are; how full of assumptions, how often not well thought out, full of assumptions and presumptions that do not really bear much scrutiny, much probing, and that can be pretty quickly revealed to be without secure foundations. Even matter - you just have to know, well, maybe a fair amount about modern physics. It is like, "Matter? It is the most obvious thing," but at a certain point, hmm, what are we actually talking about here, and when we talk about it, are we assuming and presuming, and what is the basis for assuming that? Can we be absolutely secure in those assumptions? Or we find out that it is resting on a set of assumptions, or the definition - of self, of matter, of whatever it is - is full of contradictions. ^2-5
###### 3-1
All this applies equally to notions of [[divinity]] and [[soul]]. They are vague notions. They rest on other assumptions. Any assumptions, you push them deep enough, and you are going to come to something that you just have to assume without knowing it is an absolute truth - in other words, it has no secure foundations. And a lot of notions actually end up being kind of circular in the definition, as you will see when we talk about soul, et cetera. And in fact, that is probably true about everything, that there is a kind of assumptionality and vagueness and kind of incoherence or circularity, self-contradictoriness, about everything - anything you might name or point to or use as a concept or [[experience]]. Okay, so all that as a kind of precursor. And I am also aware, of course, that as I said there is a lot of material here. There is a lot of material on this [[retreat]], and then you add it to the other retreats and the whole thing about [[emptiness]] and the [[imaginal]] - it is really quite a lot. And it is hard, you know. I appreciate it is hard to kind of keep it all in mind. Especially hard, I mean, if you are not practicing with this material in a really exploratory way. And also a lot of these ideas are not necessarily always so simple or easy to understand. So I fully appreciate that. ^3-1
###### 3-2
And by now what is happened is - someone very often says, "What do you mean when you say x or when you say y or when you say [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]]?" And I know that that person has heard me explain it or unfold it at maybe even some length in other talks in the past, and yet still they are asking. So this is very normal, very understandable. Partly what I want to do now in exploring this web is also to - hopefully it can function as somewhere between a kind of exploration of the whole web of ideas and a glossary, a kind of glossary of terms, which is a pretty strange thing to try and do in a talk, in a recorded talk format, rather than a book where you can just flip to that page and quickly look it up, but I am hoping it will be helpful. I am hoping you will just remember this is the glossary talk and I can just go there and find it and it is about this time in or whatever. But it is pretty strange as an idea, so I hope it is helpful, I hope it is not too dry. Hopefully it will serve. ^3-2
###### 3-3
[17:33] So I made a list of 20 terms. It is also strange because each of these terms I am going to be pretty brief. That is the whole point, trying to be quite brief. But each of these terms refer to a wide range of [[experience]] and the things I have talked about at much more length, so it is not always easy to kind of sum them up very succinctly or as succinctly as possible. So somewhere between a very brief glossary and a sort of looking at the [[relationships]] and filling it out a little bit. Alrighty? So 20 terms. ^3-3
###### 3-4
Number (1) one is - actually we just used it a minute or two ago - the [[Phenomenology|phenomenological]] approach. So [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] in Greek means [[Perception|appearance]], that which appears. Now, in my life, as I said, what I have is appearances. The assumption that this or that is underneath appearances, or it is really matter, or all appearances/perceptions come from the brain, this is all assumptions. What I have is appearances/phenomena. I use the word appearances, experiences, and perceptions interchangeably. So what I have is appearances, what I have is perceptions, what I have is experiences. That is what I have as a [[Personhood|human being]]. I do not go then, in the phenomenological approach, and add the assumption that everything comes from the neurophysiology of the brain and that is what gives rise to perceptions, et cetera. And I do not also come from a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] perspective that first there is God or beingness or whatever or something like that. It is just there is appearances. Let us just relate to appearances and see what we can find out. ^3-4
###### 3-5
So that is the [[Phenomenology|phenomenological]] approach. Why it is so powerful is that, for me, it is a very powerful way into [[Insight|understanding]] [[emptiness]] and also the [[imaginal]]. So one of the sort of proto-phenomenologists, if you like, William James, the psychologist and philosopher, for him anything that arose in [[experience]] was worthy of a phenomenological approach. That includes [[Image|images]], that includes things that appear to be psychic [[Phenomenon|phenomena]], et cetera. But basically whatever appears to me, I can relate to as a phenomenon and investigate it, and investigate what kinds of [[relationships]] and how it works, how relationships function around that thing, whether it is an image or a worldly [[perception]] or whatever of the different senses, et cetera, or an idea. All that is appearance - an idea, even, is appearance - and it is worthy of investigation. Of course there is differences between those domains, kinds of appearance, but still. I will just put this in now; it is something we will come back to. What I think is if we go deeply enough and radically enough with this phenomenological approach, actually there is ways that it can end up opening what we might call [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] philosophy. But we will come back to that. So first one's the phenomenological approach. ^3-5
###### 4-1
The (2) second one, and we have talked about this before: [[ways of looking]]. For me, this is another really fundamental, really powerful and pervasive concept. By which I mean not just looking with the eyes, certainly, but ways of sensing, ways of knowing, ways of perceiving. So it involves any senses. But really it refers to what is the perspective that is being employed now, and included in that is the relationship with the object that I am perceiving, whatever that is (internal, external, et cetera). Am I, for example, grasping at it? Am I pushing it away? Am I seeing it as self or [[Anatta|not-self]], et cetera? All these are different ways of looking. Wrapped up in that always in the way of looking is the [[conceptual framework]]. So the whole kind of mishmash of conditioning factors in the perceiving makes the way of looking. And there is always a way of looking. Most of the time, unless you are really into this way of practicing - and even then - the way of looking is not conscious. We are not actually conscious of everything that is involved in the way of looking, and most human beings have very little range or leeway in the ways of looking. In other words, they can just kind of, on a very gross level, shift the ways of looking a little bit. I would see [[Meditation|insight meditation]] practice as the practice of a whole range of ways of looking, really developing that flexibility and that range of ways of looking in practice, in ways that really have a powerful effect. So that is number two, ways of looking. ^4-1
###### 4-2
Related to that is number (3) three, this whole idea of [[fabrication]], because we start to see, as we play around with [[ways of looking]] in the [[Phenomenology|phenomenological]] approach, that perceptions-[[Perception|appearances]]-experiences are fabricated more or less dependent on the way of looking. In other words, some ways of looking really seem to fabricate, if you like, more perception, more of a [[The Self|sense of self]], a more solid sense of self, a more separate, a more [[Contraction|contracted]] sense of self. Also with objects - more separate, solid, real-seeming, more oppressive, also; and in fact with the whole sense of the world and other things such as time and even space, et cetera. So there is a spectrum of fabrication, and different ways of looking fabricate more or less, all the way to extremely gross and solid and oppressive to much, much less fabricated, less fabricated, less fabricated, et cetera, down into not fabricating at all. What is fabricated there, as I said, is [[dukkha]], is dis-ease and suffering, but also the sense of self, the sense of object, the sense of world, the sense of time - all of it. So the fabrication of perception, that is number three. ^4-2
###### 4-3
Number (4) four is the concept of [[emptiness]]. So this really means that what we come to understand, one way or another, about these ideas of [[ways of looking]], [[fabrication]], coming out of the [[Phenomenology|phenomenological]] approach, are one very powerful way of [[Insight|understanding]] emptiness. Emptiness means that no thing, nothing exists in a way that is inherent, has what they call inherent existence - in a way that is independent of the way of looking, independent of the mind that is looking at it. In other words, it is the way of looking that makes it a thing and that makes it seem like a separate, independently-existing thing. Without the way of looking and without being fabricated by the way of looking, there is not the [[Perception|appearance]] of that thing. So that is one way of understanding it. You can also do it analytically and you find out the whole notion of things that seem so real, so solid, so independently existing, is actually incoherent, that things are actually unfindable. That is another way into understanding emptiness. ^4-3
###### 5-1
What is empty? Everything is empty, without question. So not just all selves and all things - and that means any notion of self, so even [[the self]] as process, not a real thing; it is just arising as a [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]]; it is a relative degree of [[fabrication]]. But [[awareness]] is empty, too. Actually, even the notion of fabrication is empty, too. In other words, it is not really real. It is a kind of construct that we see - there is actually a way of going deeper and deeper into the whole teaching of fabrication as a practice, and you find out that fabrication, too, is kind of incoherent. It cannot be a reality. [[Dependent origination]], similarly, is empty - all those 12 links, or 13, or 10, or whatever system you are using. All of them are lacking inherent existence. They do not refer to real units of existence or units of being or realities or entities or whatever. The [[Unfabricated]] actually also turns out to be empty, and the whole distinction then between what is unfabriacted and fabricated, also illusory. [[Emptiness]], as well, is also empty. So emptiness is a very radical, pervasive concept. Everything, without question, is empty. What we end up with then - we start with this notion of ways of looking, and we end up with this really radical, thorough [[insight]] that in the end there are only ways of looking. The ways of looking are empty, too, but all we have is a range of ways of looking, which we can expand, and that is not realities, that is ways of looking. Those ways of looking also do not inherently exist. But all we have, all we come to, the [[freedom]] that we come to, is there are just ways of looking. Something very beautiful, very radical, very profound in that insight, and extremely far-reaching. ^5-1
###### 5-2
So in a traditional [[Dharma]] approach, as I said, the idea of [[ways of looking]], we channel that into the direction of which are the ways of looking that bring more [[Dukkha|suffering]], or lock suffering into place or whatever, and which are the ways of looking that ease suffering? So the whole concept of ways of looking, in the sort of narrow Dharma sense, is tied up very much with the [[Four Noble Truths]], with what leads to suffering and what leads to the ease of suffering. But in exploring ways of looking, we also see that there are other directions that do not have - or at least do not obviously have - much to do with suffering and the [[Freedom|end of suffering]] that can open up. So a way of looking can open up, for example, [[soulmaking]] more or less, or [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]] more or less. They are related to freedom and ending suffering, reducing suffering, but sometimes not in a very obvious way. Okay, so that is the fourth, [[emptiness]]. ^5-2
###### 5-3
The (5) fifth, the words [[imaginal]] and [[image]]. So when I use the word image, I mean an imaginal image, okay? Which means definitely not just imaginary - i.e. just completely fictitious. It also does not have to be - we think image has to be something visual; it does not. It can involve any of the senses and quite unusual [[Ways of Looking|ways of knowing]] and ways of perceiving things. But it also refers to more than just the use of the imagination. So just using the imagination does not mean imaginal, nor even if an image comes and it has a kind of mythic character - I do not know, dragons and even [[Jesus]] or whatever - or some classic [[Archtetype|archetypal]] figure or something. It may not be imaginal. An image is an image for me, or imaginally functioning for me, it is imaginal for me, if for me at that time it has a kind of [[unfathomability]] to it, a depth to it, just for example in the way that a person does. So we would never, hopefully, say, "This person, my friend x, she means this to me," or "She is this." I mean, we might say that, but we always know that that never captures her entirely. There is something I can not get to the bottom of her. Why? Because she is a person. She is a person. There is something unfathomable there. I can not reduce her. If I do start reducing her, what is going to happen to my relationship with her? She is probably not going to stick around much. ^5-3
###### 5-4
But similarly with [[Imaginal|imaginal figures]], I can not capture them. They have this [[unfathomability]]. ^5-4
###### 5-5
There is something kind of beyond the reach of my grasp, that I can keep uncovering meanings and truths and [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] to them, but I can not reduce them - or rather I am not reducing, for them to be [[imaginal]]. I can not say, "This [[image]] is just a result of some random neurochemical reactions in my brain, or neurophysiological pathways being fired" or whatever, nor can I reduce it in the way of "I am having this image, this image is coming, because it represents this from my childhood or this factor of my mind" or something. So imaginal means not reduced. There is a sense of irreducibility to them. It might encompass all of that or acknowledge all of that is involved. The neurophysiological, of course it is involved. It might have some bearing (we will talk about this; I think we did on the Re-enchanting [[retreat]]), what is the relationship with my [[History|personal history]] and this image. But not reducing the image to the personal history, to be a result of the personal history. ^5-5
###### 6-1
So what is [[imaginal]] to me, an imaginal figure, has a kind of otherness and a kind of autonomy, okay? Just like a person, it is like, they are not part of me, I do not completely control them. You can hear implicit in that is for something to be an [[image]], it requires me to have a certain [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] at it, because if I start to see it as, "No, no, no, this is just random neurochemistry or whatever. This dream that happened was just my brain randomly firing at night, that is what brains do," I have a way of looking there that is not imaginal and the image is resolved, or reduced, or I lose interest in it or whatever. It is no longer imaginal. So in the meaning of the word image, it is not just an object. It includes the way of looking at that object, and - we will come back to this - we are kind of granting it a certain autonomy. With that, because there is this [[unfathomability]] and they are not reducible, in time - and I will come back to this - we sense a kind of, let us call it [[divinity]] to the image. It is part of the [[dimensionality]]. This will keep finding more dimensions in this image, in the unfathomability of it. ^6-1
###### 6-2
All of this is meaningful, so that is part of what an [[image]] is. It is always meaningful in some way. ^6-2
###### 6-3
It does not mean "it means x" or "it means y"; meaningful is a much fuller, less tightly circumscribed term. And always with the [[imaginal]] is some kind of [[Beauty|sense of beauty]] and some kind of sense of [[Divinity|sacredness]]. So there may be quite a surprising sense of beauty; there is a breadth and diversity to the kinds of beauties that can open up and the kinds of sense of beauty and the sense of sacredness that can open up through imaginal practice, in imaginal practice, as present there. Oftentimes, yeah, it is quite surprising. That is a feature of [[image]] and imaginal practice: beauty and sacredness. ^6-3
###### 6-4
Now, with the [[imaginal]] and [[Image|images]] - and I will also use the word [[Fantasy|fantasies]] almost interchangeably with images, but maybe when it has a bit more of a [[Stories|narrative]] feel to it I will use the word fantasies - we do not just mean intrapsychic. These also relate to how we perceive the world. So images, fantasies come in, they pervade, they mix with, they saturate our [[perception]] of everything - of self, of other, of world, of being, of path, et cetera. They operate in our life. Sometimes people say, "Well, I do not get any images," meaning they do not get any intrapsychic images, sort of like I shut my eyes and nothing comes. But images are in our life. And I would say where there is [[love]], where we love deeply, where something is really alive for us, where something is really important to us, where something is really meaningful to us, there image and fantasy are operating in our life in relation to and around that thing, whatever that thing is - if it is [[Dharma]], or practice, or a lover; it can be absolutely anything, absolutely anything. Where there is love, [[meaningfulness]], importance, aliveness, there there is image and fantasy. ^6-4
###### 6-5
Now, I am going to throw in one more thing here in [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]], which is that it involves also what I call seeing the [[image]] as an image, knowing it is an image. In other words, we are not taking this literally. If I have an image of - well, certainly if I have an image of having sex with someone, it does not mean I have to have sex with someone or I am going to have sex with them. It does not mean that at all. I do not have to take it literally. But actually any image, it might have an outflow into life, but often that outflow is - it is almost always not literal; it is always subtly kind of refracted or modulated in life in the way that it is expressed. Seeing image as image. It does not mean, if I have this image, that I am picking up some kind of ESP, either, or whatever - although, of course, there is that possibility, too. I am not going to go into that distinction on this course. Seeing image as image also means that the ideas and the concepts that are perhaps wrapped up with the image are not taken as truth claims. I am not saying, "This is the reality," or "This is true" about whatever. Okay, so that was the fifth one, image and imaginal. ^6-5
###### 6-6
The (6) sixth one, very related, is [[soulmaking]], which I used already. What is soulmaking? It is anything, any activity or [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] or way of being, that gives rise to a sense of [[Soul|soulfulness]]. So we could use it in the way of meaning it is soulfulness-making; it is making the [[experience]] of soulfulness. And again, it could be anything. It could be anything, in relationship with anything at all. The way of being with it, the way of looking at it, the thing that I do with it or in relationship to it, gives rise to a sense of soulfulness. Again, this is very related to the definitions of [[imaginal]], but when there is soulfulness, there is a sense of importance, of deep importance. This thing is important to me. Strange as it might seem to someone else, this is important to me. It has a deep importance. It has a [[beauty]] to it. ^6-6
###### 7-1
There is [[love]] involved, and often very different kinds of love, a large range in the kind of expressions of love that are involved in [[Soul|soulfulness]]. [[Meaningfulness]], resonances. So [[soulmaking]] is recognized through its resonances in the heart, in the emotionality, its resonances in terms of [[image]] - so an image has resonance with other image, and an image itself is resonant with the [[energy body]], which I will come to in a little bit, and with ideas. Soulmaking also gives a sense of [[dimensionality]]. It involves image and [[fantasy]], and also idea, what we are going to call [[logos]]; all of that. So soulmaking means soulfulness-making, in the sense it makes that kind of [[Gestalt Psychology|gestalt]] - the gestalt of those kinds of experiences refers to a sense of soulfulness. But soulmaking can also mean making soul, making something called soul, so not just soulfulness as an adjective to describe a set of experiences but also making something called soul. Okay. So the sixth term here is soulmaking. ^7-1
###### 7-2
The (7) seventh term is indeed that word [[soul]]. So what does this mean? Here again I can use it in two ways. I can use soul not in the sense of referring to an entity, but referring to a [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] - soul is just a way of looking that gives rise to soulfulness, that gives rise to [[soulmaking]]. So when I say soul, I am just referring to it as a way of looking. But I can also refer to soul as if it were an entity. We will talk about it as an entity, an empty entity, going back to what we said earlier about self. We talk about self as if it is an entity, but it is not - it is empty, yet we still use the concept and we feel it as an entity, et cetera, at times. So similarly, we can talk about soul as if it was an entity. What kind of entity? Well, it is that entity, that aspect of [[citta]], if you like, that facet of citta or being, which sees or senses in a soulmaking way. That is the entity of soul. It is that which sees in a soulmaking way, in what I meant with all that before with [[image]], with [[fantasy]], with [[meaningfulness]], with depth, with [[dimensionality]] and [[beauty]] and all that. That is soul. So soulmaking increases soul, it makes soul, in the sense that it reinforces, it strengthens, it widens and deepens that entity or that capacity or that tendency to see in a soulmaking way, to see in a way that gives rise to soulfulness, to see imaginally and with meaningfulness and resonance and depth and beauty and all that. Soulmaking builds soul, it makes soul. Okay, so that is the seventh, the term soul. ^7-2
###### 7-3
[42:41] The (8) eighth is the term [[energy body]]. Here I really mean - you know, it can sound like we are talking about something, some kind of New Age idea or sort of esoteric idea. Really I am referring to a mode of attending to the [[experience]] of body - a [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]], again, if we go back to the [[Phenomenology|phenomenological]] approach. The energy body really refers to that, a way of attending to this space, actually a little bit bigger than what appears to be my [[Embodiment|physical body]], and the feeling of that, the sense of that; yes, the [[image]] of it, but also the palpable sense of that field of vibration, texture, [[energy]], et cetera. Really important to stress here there is a real spectrum, there is a wide spectrum, in that experience, so that we can experience a very, very refined field of energy, very insubstantial, ethereal, and that is lovely and actually very important. Sometimes even that goes and there is just a sense of space, which is really the edge of what we might call energy body experience. ^7-3
###### 7-4
But at the other end, there is also just the sense of something really dense and earthy and solid and very substantial. We can feel the [[energy body]] there. So the energy body refers to that whole spectrum. And it means more than just what many people are familiar with from, say, [[mindfulness]] practice or more conventional or common ways of teaching [[Meditation|insight meditation]] practice - what can seem at times just like this pulsing or flickering field of sensations, or field of hot or cold or pressure, et cetera. Yes, that is a certain kind of, let us say, mode of [[attention]] or feeling of [[experience]] of the energy body, but it actually is much broader than that. There is ways of paying attention and an experience of energy body that are not like either that or the regular sort of solidity we feel. There is really a whole range there. That is energy body. That is the eighth. ^7-4
###### 8-1
The (9) ninth is [[eros]], which we have already defined in a small way and we are going to expand it and kind of make a bigger definition as we go along. So it is the [[desire]] - eros is a kind of desire. It is the wanting more contact, more connection, more touching, more [[experience]] of or to experience more of, to know more or to know more of, to penetrate more or to penetrate more of, or to open more and to open to more of, to have more intimacy with some object, some erotic object (either in everyday [[perception]] or in [[imaginal]], intrapsychically). So note that this is multidimensional, multifaceted. We are not just talking about a mental faculty here - I will come back to this, but some kind of vitakka-vicāra thing where you are just probing the object. I will come back to that relationship. First of all, it is not just mental. It involves all the senses. And it is [[Embodiment|embodied]], which does not mean that it needs to manifest in action. More importantly, and this is where the definition starts to get bigger, it involves and it pulls in and stimulates the imaginal and the ideational. So actually when we talk about eros, we are talking about something that includes the imaginal and the ideational in certain ways, in ways that expand them and moves towards [[soulmaking]]. So eros is the ninth term. ^8-1
###### 8-2
And you can see [[eros]] is one kind of [[desire]], if we use that word, (10) desire, as the tenth term. ^8-2
###### 8-3
And [[desire]], we can maybe use it in a way that is more neutral, or as a more broad term, perhaps similar to the Pāli word [[Hindrances|chanda]]. So desire would then include [[eros]] as a subset in the way that we have just described. When it does that, when the desire is of that kind, it is eros. But desire would also include [[craving]] and [[clinging]] and these kind of words we have used before, which I will come to in a minute. But the tenth is just desire as kind of a broad term of which there are different kinds, and it is kind of a neutral term. ^8-3
###### 8-4
That word (11) [[craving]] is the eleventh. The eleventh term is craving. We will come back to this more. I am going to say craving is a kind of [[desire]] that does not lead to [[soulmaking]]. Actually it leads to a kind of [[contraction]]. Soulmaking is an opening movement, and craving brings contraction. As I said, you can actually feel that in the being, in the body, in the [[energy body]], in the mind, and in lots of other ways which we will go into. Craving brings [[dukkha]], in the way that we might use it, okay? So to distinguish [[eros]] and craving, different kinds of desire. But craving is the eleventh term. ^8-4
###### 8-5
Maybe if I use the term (12) [[clinging]] as the twelfth term, what I am really referring to is that whole spectrum that I talked about in the first few talks, where you are really talking about something that can be very, very gross, gripping, like, "Do not leave me, I need you!", that kind of clinging, to something really, really subtle, talking about actually [[Ignorance|avijjā]], just the belief, the unconscious assumption, that this thing - whatever this thing is, this emotion, this fingernail, this foot - is me or mine, unconsciously, without even thinking about it, or even the avijjā that this thing - whatever this thing is, this moment of vedanā or this lamp in front of me - has inherent existence; that avijjā is a very subtle level of clinging. It is wrapped up in [[attention]], because the mind needs to kind of cling in a very subtle way to actually perceive anything. But clinging, we might use it to refer to that whole spectrum in that broader sense. Okay, so that is the twelfth term, clinging. ^8-5
###### 8-6
[50:09] The (13) thirteenth term is uh…I have to apologize here; I have used it already, libido, and I have already used it inconsistently, so apologies. [laughs] In a way, it is because it is not, for me - at least not yet - that important a term. So apologies, and just to note I have been inconsistent. Sometimes I might use it in a way that is almost equivalent to the way I am using [[eros]], and I think that is the way James Hillman likes to use it. So sometimes I might use it that way. I am also thinking about using it to mean something more like libido as the [[Embodiment|embodied]], directed, intentional flow of life force into any area or domain. So that might be a stream of creativity, or work, or a relationship, or building something, or whatever. It might be a stream, it might be a trickle, it might be a torrent. ^8-6
###### 8-7
In a way, it refers to psychic [[energy]] and the way that can be employed in different ways. I think that is equivalent to how Jung uses the term, but I also read something recently where he sort of said that and then said something else, "but I do not mean it like that," but he did not really explain the alternative and I couldn't find anything else, so I am not sure how he uses it. But it is a term that people use. For Freud, I think it was just the pleasure principle, in a way, or the instinct that came out of the id, the sort of pool of animalistic instincts, if you like, and the force often guided by the pleasure principle and maybe other things, and that is the libido. Sometimes Freud referred to it that way. For other people it literally means sexual urge or [[desire]]. And there is also, some of you will know - I am going to return to this - a psychoanalyst, I think he was very active in the '50s and '60s, possibly, Scottish, called Fairbairn. He used libido in a way that sounds at first similar to the way we are using [[eros]] - a desire to connect. So people use it in a - it sounds similar, but actually I am going to point out some differences later on in the [[retreat]]. So libido, people use it in very different ways. Sorry I have already been sloppy and inconsistent there. All I can say is maybe the sloppiness and fluidity in the way I am using it just reflects its etymology, which I have already said, libido, libation, liquid, this is the etymology; it is liquidy. So I am quite fluid in my definitions. That is a pretty lame excuse, but. I do not think we will be using it much anyway. Anyway, apologies. That is the thirteenth term. ^8-7
###### 9-1
The (14) fourteenth term is [[psyche]]. So one meaning of psyche, in the way that I use it, is just really the totality of the [[citta]], the psyche. In other words, the mind, but not reduced to the thinking mind; just the whole totality of citta. But another kind of inflection of the meaning means especially [[soul]], so using it equivalently with soul in the way that I defined soul earlier in this talk, as the sort of organ of [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]]. So psyche as the organ of imaginal perception. But there is a second way that I use it sometimes, and by psyche I mean the totality of imaginal perceptions. Jung actually says psyche is [[image]]. But so, I am using it sometimes as the totality of the citta; more often as the equivalent with soul, the organ of imaginal perception; but quite a few times I will use it as the totality of imaginal perceptions, so it is almost interchangeable with image. ^9-1
###### 9-2
(15) [[Logos]]. So there is another Greek word, your [[eros]], [[psyche]], logos. Logos, I am using that to refer to a concept or an idea, or a whole [[conceptual framework]]. So in other words, what we are elaborating here is a kind of conceptual framework, but any concept or any idea or any conceptual framework is a logos. So for example, when I say 'the autonomy of the [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]],' as if they have a degree of being independent of me, that is a concept. It is an idea. It is a logos that is operating in imaginal practice - even at the same time as we know it is a [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]], which is another logos. So you can have mixtures of concepts operating at any time. If I reduce the imaginal figure to, let us say, it is the product of random neuronal firings, or conditioned neuronal firings, or it is the product of my - it is expressing something from my childhood, or it is expressing an aspect of my being, this kind of reduction of the imaginal figure - any kind of reduction - involves a logos in operation. ^9-2
###### 9-3
Any idea of causality, that this is a result of that in the past, for instance, is also a [[logos]], a concept operating. Another alternative would be what is called [[telos]], another Greek word - you are learning a lot of Greek on this [[retreat]]! Telos refers to almost like causality from the future. I have talked about this, I think, on the last retreat. That is a different logos, a different concept operating, that the future, something, so to speak, from the future, beckons us and shapes the present. Very different idea, very different logos. If we talk about the [[divinity]] of [[eros]] - which is something we will come back to - that is a logos. [[Neuroscience]] as a whole is a whole [[conceptual framework]], is a whole logos. The idea that [[consciousness]] arises from matter as an epiphenomenon of matter, of neurology, that is a logos. Actually, evolution itself is a whole conceptual framework, is a logos. ^9-3
###### 9-4
So what I want to say is that there is always a conception, there is always a [[logos]] operating in the mind - always, always, always, except during an [[experience]] of the [[Unfabricated]], when there is a collapse of [[Conceptual Framework|conceptuality]]. By conceptuality and logos, I include thought structures and thoughts, but it goes way deeper than that. So there is conceptuality operating even when there is no thought whatsoever. And oftentimes, the concepts operating are just assumed, not really checked out, and oftentimes they are operating - most of the time they are operating without us being conscious of what they are. But when I talk about logos, because it is wrapped up in [[perception]] I am not talking about something abstract. We live a logos, or we live logoi. We live different ideas. Different concepts shape how we live, they inform how we live, but more fundamentally they shape our [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]]. They are part of, they are included in, the way we look at everything, and therefore what we perceive, what appears to us. So they have massive influence. I am not talking about abstract ideas here. So the fifteenth is logos. The (16) sixteenth is what I am going to call the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]], or the soulmaking dynamic. So those are interchangeable terms. Now, I am going to devote quite a lot of time to that on this [[retreat]], but what it really means is that the more, the wanting more that we talked about with [[eros]] - more connection, more opening, opening to more of the erotic object, penetrating more, to know more, to experience more - this wanting more, that push there, if you like, or wish to open more to the erotic object, that starts bringing in, inseminating, influencing, expanding the [[psyche]] in relation to that object - in other words, the [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]] of that object - so more [[dimensionality]] is created and discovered in that object. In my erotic connection with my lover or whatever it is, I start to see in her, I start to see in him, I start to see more, more dimensions. They are not just this person I can put a box around. They are even more than just a [[Personhood|human being]], or rather the notion of humanity starts to open and have other dimensions. ^9-4
###### 10-1
So there is an expansion of the [[psyche]]; they become richer, more complicated, deeper, wider. ^10-1
###### 10-2
There is an expansion of [[psyche]], of [[image]], and also of [[logos]]. In other words, my whole idea of who they are, my idea then of what a [[Personhood|human being]] is and what [[soul]] is, that gets expanded as well. So this is really, really important. When it gets expanded, they are then more yummy to me, more interesting, more attractive. It increases the [[eros]] there. And so there is a kind of self-feeding, self-generating, ongoing fertilization, mutual fertilization of eros, psyche, logos; mutual widening, deepening, enriching, complicating, adding [[dimensionality]], et cetera, that goes on. We can say much, much more about that. But when I refer to the eros-pscyhe-logos dynamic - or I will also use the word [[soulmaking dynamic]] for the same thing - that is that process. We have a lot to say about that. That is very, very fundamental, I would say, and [[Insight|understanding]] that. A very central concept. Okay. That is number sixteen, the eros-psyche-logos dynamic. ^10-2
###### 10-3
Number (17) seventeen is this term [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]]. So this is something, I would say, that we start to notice in [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]], that as we go into imaginal practice we start to see that it begins to spill over. Even if I am practicing with my eyes shut, I open my eyes after I have been working deeply with [[mindfulness]] and sensitivity with this imaginal figure, I open my eyes and there is a kind of spilling over to the [[perception]] of the world, to the world of perception, so that something of the [[image]], and something particularly of the [[divinity]] of the image, starts to pervade my sense of the cosmos that I feel myself to be part of. So this is something we notice. It is also an instance of that whole [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos]] expanding dynamic that I was just referring to. It is starts to expand beyond just the object, but also to other objects and to the world. ^10-3
###### 10-4
So there are infinite possibilities for [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]]. More typical ones involve a kind of universal cosmopoesis, in the sense that - for example, meditating a lot on [[Metta|mettā]], eventually, at some point, a meditator will have the [[experience]] that the world is [[love]], the cosmos is shot through with love. Now, you explain that to someone on the high street and they will say, "What are you talking about?" It is a [[perception]] of the cosmos, it is a mystical perception, but it is characterized by universality: all things in the world are of the same substance, and the substance is love. It could be [[awareness]]. So if you practice a lot with a vastness of awareness and other related practices, you get a similar thing. The cosmopoesis there is also universal: everything is awareness, everything is the play of awareness, et cetera. ^10-4
###### 10-5
But then there is also - rarer in our circles, and more interesting for that very reason - particular cosmopoeses. So this particular erotic [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]] that I am working with, sensitively and mindfully in practice, then I get up and walk around and look at the world around me, and I notice that the particularities of that figure that I was opening to and discovering and sensitive to in the practice, they come to characterize the [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]]. So the whole world becomes this particular, or a manifestation of, or flavored with this particular imaginal figure and his/her/its characteristics, its particularities. So cosmopoesis. Note that word, -poesis, in contrast to -logy. Cosmology is a word that people know. Cosmology means the study of the science of the universe. So we go and we hear about Big Bangs and all that stuff, which is - I [[love]] it; it is absolutely fascinating to me. The difference between cosmology and cosmopoesis is the absence of a truth claim that goes with the cosmopoesis. So we are recognizing that this is a creation of the [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]], or a better word is participation. We are participating in something. The way of looking, the [[citta]], the [[soul]], is participating in the cosmos. So there is a participatory aspect of a kind of cosmopoesis, of the reality creating. And also, cosmopoesis - we are talking about poetic truths, if you like, here, which is something I have talked about before, which is different than the usual notion of scientific truth. This, also, I have talked about before; there is a whole - you know, really going into the philosophy of science and what is true and what is a model, et cetera, and all that. And also to point out that when I use the words - I was contrasting poesis and [[logos]], but actually when I use the word logos in the way we are using it, we are not making a truth claim, other than that everything is empty, and even that actually you let go of at a certain point. A logos is just a concept that we can pick up, or a [[conceptual framework]] we can pick up, without insisting or even believing it as true. Okay? But cosmopoesis is the seventeenth one. ^10-5
###### 11-1
[1:06:53] The (18) eighteenth term is [[Divinity|theophany]]. Theophany literally means an [[Perception|appearance]] of the divine. I think I gave a set of - no, it was the last five talks of the [[retreat]] [[Dharma|The Path]] of the [[Imaginal]] that had the title of something like A Sacred Universe: [[Insight]], Theophany, [[Cosmology|Cosmopoesis]], something like that. So we dealt with it a lot there, and in a way the whole of the [[Re-enchanting the Cosmos]] retreat had to do with cosmopoesis and theophany. But theophany would refer to maybe when a particular thing or object becomes a particular face of the divine, or it becomes a face of the divine - again, it can be universal, but more I am interested in the particular. So this - it really could be anything - this tree, or this person, or this body, or whatever, becomes a particular face of the divine, or this imaginal figure is a particular theophany, a face of God, if you like, a face of the divine. That is the eighteenth term, theophany. ^11-1
###### 11-2
The (19) nineteenth term is [[divinity]]. And again, this is something that we notice. I am using it very broadly, so I am actually not defining. But, if you like, it refers to a kind of [[unfathomability]], mystery, otherness, including of transcendence - all of that. But actually the notions are really quite wide of what that might involve. It is something I'd rather leave it to your [[experience]] and just say, notice with [[Image|images]], as you work with them, when they become really alive, that they have this kind of numinous quality. It is something we notice, rather than we define it. So you will notice in [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]] that more and more with an image, it has this kind of quality of divinity. It is part of its otherness. ^11-2
###### 11-3
Just to say a little bit about that word. You know, standard [[Meditation|insight meditation]] will bring experiences of [[divinity]] of certain kinds - a whole range, actually. Various experiences of divinity, mystical experiences, I would say would be inevitable for meditators meditating with dedication and consistently with insight meditation techniques and approaches, et cetera. So for example, the [[Awareness|big awareness]] thing, everything is awareness, or everything is [[love]] - it really feels like there is a divinity to that love, the [[Cosmology|cosmos]] is shot through with a divine love; this awareness has somehow the sense [of divinity]. People often talk, though they never have before, they start talking in theistic terms, almost surprising to themselves when those kinds of very common experiences happen. I would say certain kinds of practices, I can put people in a room, get them to do these practices, and it is just a mater of time until these very standard experiences of divinity open up, and people almost inevitably start using that language. ^11-3
###### 11-4
So the question is, if these experiences open up even in standard [[Meditation|insight meditation]], what is the attitude to these experiences? What is the relationship to them? How are we interpreting them? How are we conceptualizing them? So a person might be told or might hear or think, "Well, all experiences are [[Impermanence|impermanent]]. Do not think about them. Do not get attached to them. Do not try and repeat them." We touched on this earlier. That is useful sometimes. Sometimes that is useful, to let go when it is too tight, the kind of gripping, the attachment. But mostly it is not that helpful as a kind of attitude or a way of relating to these kind of experiences. It is not quite intelligent enough; it wo not open things out in a way that is that beneficial. Insight meditation, standard insight meditation techniques, conceptions, approaches, the conceptions underlying insight meditation, will lead, with a certain amount of dedication and kind of good practice, if you can say 'good,' to experiences that the [[Buddha]] did not ignore. He did not say in relation to them, "Oh, just do not try and repeat them. Let us not go there. Do not get attached," et cetera. He gave them names. He taught the monks to repeat them, et cetera. These were not something he just brushed off. These were not experiences he just brushed off. And as the [[Dharma|Buddhadharma]] evolved after the Buddha died, in different streams of the tradition - the [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]], the [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] - there was an even greater exploration and a range of [[experience]] that was opening up from people's meditative practice, and even more careful and comprehensive and manifold sort of categorization of those range of experiences involving different senses of [[divinity]]. ^11-4
###### 12-1
So when we say [[divinity]], I am leaving it quite broad, but really talking about a whole range of experiences there. Again, some may be universal in character and impersonal in character, and some may be very particular, and some are related to particularities and theophanies, et cetera, and some will be personal, a personal god, an [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]] as a personal god and not an impersonal deity. We will come back to this. So that is the nineteenth, divinity. ^12-1
###### 12-2
And the last one that I may use is (20) [[Buddha-nature]]. So again, in the [[Buddhism|Buddhist tradition]], this is a term that has a wide range of usage and arguments and all kinds of stuff. Some traditions use it in quite a narrow way: it just actually is your capacity to become fully [[Awakening|enlightened]], to become a [[buddha]], usually over many lifetimes, just by virtue of the fact that the mind, and the factors of the mind, and the contents of the mind are [[Impermanence|impermanent]]. So although there is [[ignorance]] right now, ignorance is impermanent. In other words, with the right training, you could change it. It is not fixed. It is not a fixed thing. And similarly with [[craving]] and the rest of it that gets in the way, or rather whose absence qualifies enlightenment. ^12-2
###### 12-3
So in some meanings of the word [[Buddha-nature]], it just refers to that. It is just your kind of unavoidable, no matter what you think of yourself, or where you are actually at in terms of your (quote) "spiritual development," there is always and undestroyably the possibility of becoming a [[Buddha]]. So that is one usage. Sometimes in more popular usage nowadays it just kind of refers to your innate goodness. So if you think you are a mean person and you see lots of not-so-nice stuff, then it is just a kind of way of saying that in you, at your core, is something bright and luminous and good, inherently good, inherently loving. If I use the term, I probably use it as just an alternative to the word God or [[divinity]], which I am using in a much more broad way, just because oftentimes the word God or divinity really rub people the wrong way, and especially some Buddhists. So we can use Buddha-nature, but in a different way than just that possibility. I am actually talking about something that is divine. And again, it has a range of meanings. ^12-3
###### 12-4
One kind of - perhaps the most sort of full-on meaning, if you like, is from the Shentong tradition in the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan tradition]]. Actually it is a tradition that goes back to [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Indian [[Buddhism]], but. In that tradition, [[Buddha-nature]] is interchangeable with words like [[Dharmakaya|dharmakāya]], and actually even the word [[emptiness]], which is used differently when they use it in that tradition from the way I am using it. So Buddha-nature, dharmakāya, emptiness, the absolute, and other words - there is quite a few words that are used interchangeably - means something like the cosmic [[awareness]] that is inherently in me and in you and in everything, that knows the emptiness of all things, is not separate (as separating subjects and objects) - in that sense, it is nondual. It refers, then, to the knowing - which is also empty, this knowing awareness is empty in itself - but the knowing and the [[Perception|appearances]] and their emptiness. All that, known in a kind of nondual way. In other words, it includes the whole [[Cosmology|cosmos]] as this kind of field of empty awareness knowing all things and also the emptiness of all things. So everything is Buddha-nature, everything has Buddha-nature, everything is Buddha-nature, everything is dharmakāya in that [[logos]], in that [[experience]]. ^12-4
###### 12-5
Also, even stranger - to some Buddhists, this will sound strange - is that this [[Dharmakaya|dharmakāya]] or this [[Buddha-nature]] can act. So this cosmic Buddha-nature can act in the world and manifest different [[Perception|appearances]] or different qualities for an individual, or in an individual, dependent on what that individual needs for their [[Pleasantness|well-being]] and their deeper journey, so that there is a kind of, if you like, intelligence - something akin to the world [[soul]] - there is a kind of intelligence or divine activity that is operating in and through and as Buddha-nature as well as that [[awareness]] and its inseparability from [[emptiness]], from appearances, et cetera. ^12-5
###### 13-1
Phew. Okay. So there is 20 terms in a kind of glossary. ^13-1
