As I've already said, what _we_ mean by '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>,' the way we are using that term, is actually woven in and related to and indissolubly bound up with and connected to a whole range of other terms that we're using with specific meanings to form a kind of larger <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>. There's a whole web of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span> and implied meanings there, so we can't really unpack what we mean by '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>' without beginning to say and include more of those terms, and say a little bit about those other notions, and a little bit about what the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span> are. But this whole edifice, this whole architecture, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>, is something we'll unfold gradually. There's quite a lot to it, in a way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > A whole web of relationships and implied meanings around eros" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#A whole web of relationships and implied meanings around eros" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1

I want to begin doing that now. And just before I do, you know, just to say: I'm aware that I'm referring to what is now really quite a large <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> of work. I think about all the material on <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>, and re-enchantment and all that - it's actually quite a large <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> of work together with this piece, this course on <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. So if someone who is coming from the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> tradition or something like that were to just pick a talk at random and listen to that talk, they would probably be just baffled, puzzled, probably even maybe shocked, perhaps even outraged: "What is _this_? What is he talking about? What are they talking about? How on earth did we get _here_, these words '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>,' '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>,' '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>,' even the word 'God,' '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a></span>' (whatever _that_ means)? What on earth is he talking about, and how did he get there? This is really pretty far out. Is this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhism</a></span>?<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > Its quite a large body of work which would puzzle anyone just picking one talk" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#It's quite a large body of work which would puzzle anyone just picking one talk" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^1-2

Now. [laughs] I've touched on that last question before. It may be, in some respects, quite an interesting question. In other respects, it might not be interesting at all. What's more interesting about it to me is, why is a person asking such a question, and what assumptions and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasies</a></span> are operating for them? And in our language, what <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-styles</a></span> can we approach this material with and its relationship to, let's say, more conventional interpretations of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>? I've talked about that before; I'm not going to repeat it here. But just to say: I would say this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> of material needs listening to, studying, practising with - all that material around the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, but certainly around the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> material, in series. In other words, it adds up. In that way, only then can a person kind of see and understand what is meant in these teachings<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > What soul-styles can we approach this material with" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#What soul-styles can we approach this material with" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3

But we'll also, hopefully, understand - if a person does that, listens, studies, ponders, and practises in series - that there is kind of, I would say, an almost inevitable or natural evolution of this material now. It evolved, if you like, naturally. The doors were presented one after another. The consequences, the avenues, were travelled in a kind of logical or inevitable order - one <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, one opening led to another, etc., all based on what we might call the '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a></span> approach,' which is how I would base my approach to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>. It's very, very simple, starting with very, very simple practices, including the ideas of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, but not based on the usual assumptions. This is what makes a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a></span> approach. It's not based on the usual assumptions, but based on just, what do I have as a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>? I have <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. I have what appears to me. '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">Phenomena</a></span>' means <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a></span>. And just basing it on, "This is experienced. Now, what can I discover about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>?" And introducing into that very quickly - one discovers, "I can look at it this way, and I can look at it that way. I can relate to it this way, that way," so the ideas of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> eventually come out of that, because I see some <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricate</a></span> differently than others, [as] we touched on<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > There is a natural evolution of the material" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#There is a natural evolution of the material" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4
###### 2-1
So all this unfolds. Very, very simple practices, just _not_ based on the usual assumptions, just suspending them, opening them, relating to what actually is here - <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> is here, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a></span> is here - without other assumptions. All this leads to other concepts, other ways of framing what's happening, and out of that comes a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>, and certain <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a></span>, or the availability to look in different ways and to conceive in different ways. If one doesn't understand all that, and see it through practice, almost like stage by stage, probably a person won't understand what we're saying now in these teachings - probably; there are always exceptions, of course. Without that practice and without those <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understandings</a></span> and those <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span>, there's not going to be an <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>. So that's one thing<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > Very simple practices and the suspension of usual assumptions lead to the availability to look in different ways" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Very simple practices and the suspension of usual assumptions lead to the availability to look in different ways" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
A second thing is, related, regarding these words like, for instance, '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>' or '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>' or 'God,' this is interesting, why some people react to these words. Just to point out, everyone - unless you're a real weirdo [laughs] - everyone uses the word self: I, you, self, etc. And everyone experiences selves. Everyone experiences selves - their own self or selves, and the selves of others. It's just the same, or rather it's similar with the notion of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>. We're talking about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, okay? Just as 'self' is a word that we use, an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, so is '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>' - or rather, '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>' is a whole range of experiences, a whole range of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span> of experiences, if you like, that will become evident, that will appear in one's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, _if_ we do not block, dismiss, or rule it out. In other words, if I'm closed to the very notion of it, just a priori absolutely no way, rule it out, and if I don't open my practice in a certain way, I _won't_ have that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, and then it will seem like, "What are you talking about?", or "You're talking about something you're making up," or "It's not real," etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > Divinity is a whole range of experiences" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Divinity is a whole range of experiences" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
So we use the word, and we're referring to a whole range of experiences, just like self. And just like self, the experiences of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> and the ideas of it, we acknowledge just like self are historically and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">culturally contingent</a></span>. The selves that you and I <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> now and assume to be real, the kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">modernist self</a></span> of Western civilization, was not in many ways at all similar to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> that the people that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> was addressing 2,500 years ago in India would have experienced. A lot of what we take for granted, and the complexity, and the kinds of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Centre" data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">interiority</a></span>, just didn't exist for them. Same with medieval Christendom - very different. So just like self, experiences and ideas of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span> are historically and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">culturally contingent</a></span>, conditioned. We acknowledge that, absolutely<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > Ideas about divinity are historically and culturally contingent" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Ideas about divinity are historically and culturally contingent" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
If it seems to someone listening, if it seems like, "Okay, but one of those, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, refers to a reality, and the others, like <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>, are just <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metaphysics" data-href="Metaphysics" class="internal-link">metaphysical</a></span> speculations. They're unnecessary, they're unreal, and they're ungrounded," well, such a bias or assumption may just be reflecting a kind of indoctrination or brainwashing, if you like. The assumptions there and the actual <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> may be determined by just what is the current dominant _Weltanschauung_, world-view, of Western modernist society, culture. It's not so much that a person saying that has any very deep <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> or radical, cutting, innovative idea. Actually, they're just adopting, indoctrinated by, the assumptions of the current dominant world-view, and their <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> and their assumptions are determined primarily by that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > Assumptions and xperiences may be determined by the current dominant Weltanschauung" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Assumptions and xperiences may be determined by the current dominant Weltanschauung" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 2-5
But even more than that, again, just like the word 'self' and the notion of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, notions of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, God, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>, are empty in many other ways apart from just being historically and culturally conditioned and contingent. There are many ways to reveal the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, and on many, many different levels. I've talked and written a lot about that. The same is true of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, God, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>: empty, and in many ways, and at many levels. Now, someone with a little bit of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> will say, or maybe a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> will say, "I use the language 'self.' I use that term. But I know it's empty." And again, same regarding '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>' and '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>' and 'God,' etc. We use the language, but we know it's empty. Someone with perhaps broader <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> will also say something like, "Although it's ultimately empty, it's important to respect <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> and to care for <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>." Okay, so there's a psychological <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span> there that's quite important. But again, just the same regarding <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>: although it's ultimately empty, it's important to respect the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> (what does that mean?), and to care for the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> (what does that mean?)<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > Soul God divinity self are empty on many levels" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Soul God divinity self are empty on many levels" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-5
###### 3-1
And we can press this a little further. If we were to ask someone, this hypothetical person who uses happily words like 'self,' or 'matter' (which is almost unavoidable, another unavoidable word), or 'life' (some people use that quite a lot: life this and life that), and if we were to ask someone, "What do you _mean_ when you say 'self'? What is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>? And what is matter? What do you mean by 'matter'?", at first, they would just sort of point: "Well, I mean this, or I mean that, or I mean this here." [knocks on something] Or life - they might sweep their hands around the room or around the outside or whatever. But if you just said, "Yes, but what do you mean by that?", and you kept pushing this question, probing with the question, without a doubt, it would pretty quickly reveal just how vague the notions of self, certainly the notions of life, and even matter are; how full of assumptions, how often not well thought out, full of assumptions/presumptions that don't really bear much scrutiny, much probing, and that can be pretty quickly revealed to be without secure foundations. Even matter - you just have to know, well, maybe a fair amount about modern physics. It's like, "Matter? It's the most obvious thing," but at a certain point, hmm, what are we actually talking about here? And what, when we talk about it, are we assuming and presuming? And what is the basis for assuming that? Can we be absolutely secure in those assumptions? Or we find out that it's resting on a set of assumptions, or the definition itself - of self, of matter, of whatever it is - is full of contradictions<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > Even something like matter is quickly revealed to be without secure foundations" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Even something like matter is quickly revealed to be without secure foundations" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
All this applies equally to notions of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. They're vague notions. They rest on other assumptions. Any assumptions, you push them deep enough, and you're going to come to something that you just have to assume without knowing it's an absolute truth - in other words, it has no secure foundations. And a lot of notions actually end up being kind of circular in the definition, as you'll see when we talk about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, etc. And in fact, that's probably true about everything, that there's a kind of assumptionality and vagueness and kind of incoherence or circularity, self-contradictoriness, about everything - anything you might name or point to or use as a concept or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > There is a kind of incoherence about every concept or experience" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#There is a kind of incoherence about every concept or experience" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
Okay, so all that as a kind of precursor. And I'm also aware, of course, that, as I said, there's a lot of material here. There's a lot of material on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and then you add it to the other <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span>, and the whole thing about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> - it's really quite a lot. And it's hard, you know. I appreciate it's hard to kind of keep it all in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. Especially hard, I mean, if you're not practising with this material in a really exploratory way. And also a lot of these ideas are not necessarily always so simple or easy to understand. So I fully appreciate that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > A lot of material and not always simple or easy to understand" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#A lot of material and not always simple or easy to understand" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3
###### 3-4
And by now what's happened is, someone very often says, "What do you mean when you say X, or when you say Y, or when you say '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a></span>'?" And I _know_ that that person has heard me explain it or unfold it at maybe even some length in other talks in the past, and yet still they're asking. So this is very normal, very understandable. Partly, what I want to do now in exploring this web is also to - hopefully it can function as somewhere between a kind of exploration of the whole web of ideas, and a glossary, a kind of glossary of terms, which is a pretty strange thing to try and do in a talk, in a recorded talk format, rather than a book, where you can just flip to that page and quickly look it up, but I'm hoping it will be helpful. I'm hoping you'll just remember this is the glossary talk, and I can just go there and find it, and it's about this time in or whatever. But it is pretty strange as an idea, so I hope it's helpful. I hope it's not too dry. Hopefully it will serve<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > This talk is somewhere between an exploration of the whole web of ideas and a glossary" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#This talk is somewhere between an exploration of the whole web of ideas and a glossary" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-4
###### 4-1
So I made a list of twenty terms. It's also strange because each of these terms, I'm going to be pretty brief. That's the whole point, trying to be quite brief. But each of these terms refer to a wide range of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> and the things I've talked about at much more length, so it's not always easy to kind of sum them up very succinctly or as succinctly as possible. So somewhere between a very brief glossary, and a sort of looking at the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span> and filling it out a little bit. All righty? So twenty terms.^[Editor's note: please see the beginning of Part 2 of this talk for more information on the caveats of definitions. Rob wishes to encourage steering a middle course between, on the one hand, the illusion of comfort one might get from having precise definitions, and on the other hand, a too-quick dismissal of 'conceptuality' and definitions that are too loose - so loose that they let in too much, and the power of the idea is lost. This is tricky, and particularly for beginners, who, in the sea of new ideas and practices that they are being exposed to, might understandably want 'textbook'-like definitions to hold on to, but which may then become rigid, etc. In Soulmaking Dharma, all concepts, as well as images, need to have 'soft and elastic edges.'] ^4-1

**(1)** Number one is - actually, we just used it a minute or two ago - the **<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a></span> approach.** '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">Phenomena</a></span>' in Greek (_phainómena_) means '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a></span>,' 'that which appears.'

The assumption that this or that is underneath <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span>, or it's really matter, or all <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span>/<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span> come from the brain, these are all assumptions. What I have is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span>/<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a></span>. I use the word <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span>, experiences, and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span> interchangeably. So what I have is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span>, what I have is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>, what I have is experiences. That's what I have as a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span>. I don't go then, in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a></span> approach, and add the assumption that everything comes from the neurophysiology of the brain, and that's what gives rise to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>, etc. And I don't also come from a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metaphysics" data-href="Metaphysics" class="internal-link">metaphysical</a></span> perspective that first there is God or beingness or whatever or something like that. It's just there is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span>. Let's just relate to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span> and see what we can find out<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > 1 Phenomenological approach" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#1 Phenomenological approach" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-2

That's the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a></span> approach. Why it's so powerful is that, for me, it's a very powerful way into <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> and also the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>. One of the sort of proto-phenomenologists, if you like, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="William James" class="internal-link">William James</a></span>, the psychologist and philosopher, for him, anything that arose in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> was worthy of a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a></span> approach. That includes <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>. That includes things that appear to be psychic <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a></span>, etc. But basically, whatever appears to me, I can relate to as a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomenon</a></span> and investigate it, and investigate what kinds of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span>, and how it works, how <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span> function around that thing, whether it's an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> or a worldly <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> or whatever, of the different senses, etc., or an idea. All that is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a></span> - an idea, even, is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a></span> - and it's worthy of investigation. Of course, there are differences between those domains, kinds of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a></span>, but still. I'll just put this in now; it's something we'll come back to. What I think is if we go deeply enough and radically enough with this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a></span> approach, actually there are ways that it can end up opening what we might call <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metaphysics" data-href="Metaphysics" class="internal-link">metaphysical</a></span> philosophy. But we'll come back to that.

**(2)** The second one, and we've talked about this before: **<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>.** For me, this is another really fundamental, really powerful and pervasive concept, by which I mean not just looking with the eyes, certainly, but ways of sensing, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of knowing</a></span>, ways of perceiving. So it involves any senses. But really it refers to what is the perspective that's being employed now, and included in that is the relationship with the object that I'm perceiving, whatever that is (internal, external, etc.). Am I, for example, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> at it? Am I pushing it away? Am I seeing it as self or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>, etc.? All these are different <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>. Wrapped up in that, always in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> is the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>. So the whole kind of mishmash of conditioning factors in the perceiving makes the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. And there's _always_ a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. Most of the time, unless you're really into this way of practising (and even then), the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> is not conscious. We're not actually conscious of everything that's involved in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, and most human beings have very little range or leeway in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>. In other words, they can just kind of, on a very gross level, shift the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span> a little bit. I would see <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> practice as the practice of a whole range of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>, really developing that flexibility and that range of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span> in practice, in ways that really have a powerful effect. So that's number two, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > 2 Ways of looking - including the relationship of what Im perceiving" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#2 Ways of looking - including the relationship of what I'm perceiving" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-4
###### 5-1
**(3)** Related to that is number three, this whole idea of **<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>**, because we start to see, as we play around with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a></span> approach, that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span>, experiences are <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span> more or less dependent on the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. In other words, some <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span> really seem to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricate</a></span>, if you like, more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, more of a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, a more solid <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, a more separate, a more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">contracted</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>. Also with objects - more separate, solid, real-seeming, more oppressive, also; and, in fact, with the whole sense of the world and other things, such as time and even space, etc. So there's a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">spectrum of fabrication</a></span>, and different <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricate</a></span> more or less, all the way to extremely gross and solid and oppressive, to much, much less <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span>, less <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span>, less <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span>, etc., down into not <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricating</a></span> at all. What's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span> there, as I said, is _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dis-ease</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, but also the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, the sense of object, the sense of world, the sense of time - all of it. So the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, that's number three<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > 3 Fabrication" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#3 Fabrication" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1
###### 5-2
**(4)** Number four is the concept of **<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>**. This really means that what we come to understand, one way or another, about these ideas of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>, coming out of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a></span> approach, are one very powerful way of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a></span> means that no thing, nothing exists in a way that's inherent, has what they call inherent existence - in a way that's independent of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, independent of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> that's looking at it. In other words, it's the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> that makes it a thing and that makes it seem like a separate, independently existing thing. Without the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, and without being _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span>_ by the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, there is not the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearance</a></span> of that thing. So that's one way of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> it. You can also do it analytically, and you find out the whole notion of things that seem so real, so solid, so independently existing, is actually incoherent, [that] things are actually unfindable. That's another way into <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > 4 Emptiness" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#4 Emptiness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2

What is empty? Everything is empty, without question. So not just all selves and all things - and that means _any_ notion of self, so even <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> as process, not a real thing. It's just arising as a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. It's a relative degree of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>. But <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> is empty too. Actually, even the notion of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> is empty too. In other words, it's not really real. It's a kind of construct that we see - there's actually a way of going deeper and deeper into the whole teaching of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span> as a practice, and you find out that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a></span>, too, is kind of incoherent. It cannot be a reality. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dependent origination" class="internal-link">Dependent origination</a></span>, similarly, is empty - all those <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">twelve links</a></span>, or thirteen, or ten, or whatever system you're using. All of them are lacking inherent existence. They don't refer to real units of existence or units of being or realities or entities or whatever. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a></span> actually also turns out to be empty, and the whole distinction then between what's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="unfabricated" class="internal-link">unfabricated</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span>, also illusory. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a></span>, as well, is also empty. So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> is a very radical, pervasive concept. Everything, without question, is empty. What we end up with then - we start with this notion of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>, and we end up with this really radical, thorough <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> that in the end there are only <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span> are empty, too, but all we have is a range of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>, which we can expand. And those are not realities; those are <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>. Those <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span> also don't inherently exist. But all we have, all we come to, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> that we come to, is there are just <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>. Something very beautiful, very radical, very profound in that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, and extremely far-reaching<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > Emptiness is a radical pervasive concept" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Emptiness is a radical pervasive concept" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-3

So in a traditional <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> approach, as I said, the idea of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>, we channel that into the direction of: which are the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span> that bring more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, or lock <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> into place or whatever, and which are the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span> that ease <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>? The whole concept of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>, in the sort of narrow <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> sense, is tied up very much with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">Four Noble Truths</a></span>, with what leads to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and what leads to the ease of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. But in exploring <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>, we also see that there are other directions that don't have - or at least don't _obviously_ have - much to do with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">end of suffering</a></span> that can open up. So a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> can open up, for example, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> more or less, or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a></span> more or less. They _are_ related to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> and ending <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, reducing <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, but sometimes not in a very obvious way.

Just using the imagination does not mean '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>,' nor even if an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> comes and it has a kind of mythic character - I don't know, dragons, and even <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">Jesus</a></span> or whatever - or some classic <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Archetype" data-href="Archetype" class="internal-link">archetypal</a></span> figure or something. It may not be <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>. An <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> is an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> for me, or imaginally functioning for me, it's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> for me, if, for me, at that time, it has a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="unfathomability" class="internal-link">unfathomability</a></span> to it, a depth to it, just, for example, in the way that a person does. We would never, hopefully, say, "This person, my friend X, she means this to me," or "She _is_ this." I mean, we might say that, but we always know that that never captures her entirely. There's something I can't get to the bottom of her. Why? Because she's a person. She's a person. There's something unfathomable there. I can't reduce her. If I do start reducing her, what's going to happen to my relationship with her? She's probably not going to stick around much<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > 5 Imaginal image imaginal image" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#5 Imaginal image imaginal image" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-2

But similarly with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figures</a></span>: I can't capture them. They have this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="unfathomability" class="internal-link">unfathomability</a></span>. There's something kind of beyond the reach of my grasp, that I can keep uncovering meanings and truths and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span> to them, but I can't reduce them - or rather I'm _not_ reducing, for them to be <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>. I can't say, "This <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> is just a result of some random neurochemical reactions in my brain, or neurophysiological pathways being fired" or whatever, nor can I reduce it in the way of "I'm having this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> is coming, because it represents this from my childhood, or this factor of my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>" or something. So '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>' means not reduced. There's a sense of irreducibility to them. It might encompass all of that or acknowledge all of that is involved. The neurophysiological, of course it's involved. It might have some bearing (we'll talk about this; I think we did on the _Re-enchanting_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>), what's the relationship with my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="History" data-href="History" class="internal-link">personal history</a></span> and this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>.

What is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> to me, an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a></span>, has a kind of otherness and a kind of autonomy, okay? Just like a person, it's like, they're not part of me. I don't completely control them. You can hear, implicit in that is for something to be an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, it requires me to have a certain <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> at it, because if I start to see it as, "No, no, no, this is just random neurochemistry or whatever. This dream that happened was just my brain randomly firing at night. That's what brains do," then I have a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> there that's not <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> is resolved, or reduced, or I lose interest in it or whatever. It's no longer <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>. So in the meaning of the word '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>,' it's not just an object. It includes the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> at that object, and (we'll come back to this) we're kind of granting it a certain autonomy. With that, because there's this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="unfathomability" class="internal-link">unfathomability</a></span> and they're not reducible, in time (and I'll come back to this) we sense a kind of, let's call it '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>' to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>.

All of this is meaningful, so that's part of what an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> is. It's always meaningful in some way. It doesn't mean "it means X" or "it means Y"; 'meaningful' is a much fuller, less tightly circumscribed term.

There may be quite a surprising <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Beauty" data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">sense of beauty</a></span>.

Now, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> - and I'll also use the word '<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasies</a></span>' almost interchangeably with '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>,' but maybe when it has a bit more of a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">narrative</a></span> feel to it I'll use the word '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasies</a></span>' - we don't just mean intrapsychic. These also relate to how we perceive the world. So <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasies</a></span> come in, they pervade, they mix with, they saturate our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of everything - of self, of other, of world, of being, of path, etc. They operate in our life. Sometimes people say, "Well, I don't get any <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>," meaning they don't get any intrapsychic <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>, sort of like I shut my eyes and nothing comes. But <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> are in our life. And I would say where there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, where we <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> deeply, where something is really alive for us, where something is really important to us, where something is really meaningful to us, there <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span> are operating in our life, in relation to and around that thing, whatever that thing is - if it's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, or practice, or a lover; it can be absolutely anything. Where there is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meaningfulness" class="internal-link">meaningfulness</a></span>, importance, aliveness, _there_ there is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > The imaginal and images also relate to how we perceive the world" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#The imaginal and images also relate to how we perceive the world" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-3

Now, I'm going to throw in one more thing here in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>, which is that it involves also what I call seeing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> as an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, knowing it's an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. In other words, we're not taking this literally. If I have an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of - well, certainly if I have an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of having sex with someone, it doesn't mean I have to have sex with someone, or I'm going to have sex with them. It doesn't mean that at all. I don't have to take it literally. But actually _any_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, it might have an outflow into life, but often that outflow is - it's almost always _not_ literal; it's always subtly kind of refracted or modulated in life in the way that it's expressed. Seeing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> as <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. It doesn't mean, if I have this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, that I'm picking up some kind of ESP, either, or whatever (although, of course, there's that possibility too). I'm not going to go into that distinction on this course. Seeing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> as <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> also means that the ideas and the concepts that are perhaps wrapped up with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> are not taken as truth claims. I'm not saying, "This is the reality," or "This is true" about whatever. Okay, so that was the fifth one, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > Seeing the image as an image" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Seeing the image as an image" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-4

**(6)** The sixth one, very related, is **<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>**, which I used already. What's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>? It's anything, any activity or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> or way of being, that gives rise to a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span>. So we could use it in the way of meaning it's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span>-making; it's making the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span>. And again, it could be anything. It could be anything, in relationship with anything at all. The way of being with it, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> at it, the thing that I do with it or in relationship to it, gives rise to a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span>. Again, this is very related to the definitions of '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>,' but when there is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span>, there is a sense of importance, of deep importance. This thing is important to me. Strange as it might seem to someone else, this is important to me. It has a deep importance. It has a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> to it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > 6 Soulmaking" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#6 Soulmaking" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-1
###### 8-2
There is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> involved, and often very different kinds of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, a large range in the kind of expressions of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> that are involved in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Meaningfulness" class="internal-link">Meaningfulness</a></span>, resonances. So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> is recognized through its resonances in the heart, in the emotionality, its resonances in terms of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. An <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> has resonance with other <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, and an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> itself is resonant with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> (which I'll come to in a little bit) and with ideas. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a></span> also gives a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span>. It involves <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span>, and also idea, what we're going to call '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>'; all of that. So <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> means <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span>-making, in the sense it makes that kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Gestalt psychology" data-href="Gestalt psychology" class="internal-link">gestalt</a></span>. The <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Gestalt psychology" data-href="Gestalt psychology" class="internal-link">gestalt</a></span> of those kinds of experiences refers to a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span>. But <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> can also mean making <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, making something called <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. So not just <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span> as an adjective to describe a set of experiences, but also making something called <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. Okay. So the sixth term here is '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>.' ^8-2
###### 8-3
**(7)** The seventh term is indeed that word, **<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>**. What does this mean? Here, again, I can use it in two ways. I can use '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>' not in the sense of referring to an entity, but referring to a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>: <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> is just a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> that gives rise to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span>, that gives rise to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. When I say '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>,' I'm just referring to it as a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. But I can also refer to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> as if it were an entity. We'll talk about it as an entity, an _empty_ entity, going back to what we said earlier about self. We talk about self as if it's an entity, but it's not. It's empty, yet we still use the concept, and we feel it as an entity, etc., at times. Similarly, we can talk about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> as if it was an entity. What kind of entity? Well, it's that entity, that aspect of _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="citta" class="internal-link">citta</a></span>_, if you like, that facet of _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="citta" class="internal-link">citta</a></span>_ or being, that which sees or senses in a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> way. That's the entity of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. It's that which sees in a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> way, in what I meant in all that before - with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a></span>, with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meaningfulness" class="internal-link">meaningfulness</a></span>, with depth, with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> and all that. That's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. So <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> increases <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, it makes <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, in the sense that it reinforces, it strengthens, it widens and deepens that entity or that capacity or that tendency to see in a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> way, to see in a way that gives rise to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulfulness</a></span>, to see imaginally, and with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="meaningfulness" class="internal-link">meaningfulness</a></span> and resonance, and depth and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>, and all that. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a></span> _builds_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. It _makes_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. Okay, so that's the seventh, the term '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>.' ^8-3
###### 8-4
**(8)** The eighth is the term **<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>**. It can sound like we're talking about some _thing_, some kind of New Age idea or esoteric idea. Really I'm referring to a mode of attending to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> - a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, again, if we go back to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenology" data-href="Phenomenology" class="internal-link">phenomenological</a></span> approach. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> really refers to that: a way of attending to this space, actually a little bit bigger than what appears to be my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">physical body</a></span>, and the feeling of that, the sense of that; yes, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of it, but also the palpable sense of that field of vibration, texture, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, etc. Really important to stress here: there is a real spectrum, there's a wide spectrum, in that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, so that we can <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> a very, very refined field of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, very insubstantial, ethereal, and that's lovely and actually very important. Sometimes even _that_ goes, and there's just a sense of space, which is really at the edge of what we might call <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy body" data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">energy body experience</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > 8 Energy body" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#8 Energy body" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-4
###### 9-1
But at the other end, there's also just the sense of something really dense and earthy and solid and very substantial. We can feel the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> there. So the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> refers to that whole spectrum. And it means more than just what many people are familiar with from, say, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> practice or more conventional kinds of or more common ways of teaching <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> practice - what can seem at times just like this pulsing or flickering field of sensations, or field of hot or cold or pressure, etc. Yes, that's a certain kind of, let's say, mode of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> or feeling of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, but it actually is much broader than that. There are ways of paying <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> and experiences of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span> that are not like either that or the regular sort of solidity we feel. There's really a whole range there. That's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>. That's the eighth<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > The energy body refers to the whole spectrum of sensitivity" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#The energy body refers to the whole spectrum of sensitivity" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-1

**(9)** The ninth is **<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>**, which we've already defined in a small way, and we're going to expand it and kind of make a bigger definition as we go along. So it's the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> - <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. It's the wanting more contact, more connection, more touching, more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of or to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> more of, to know more or to know more of, to penetrate more or to penetrate more of, or to open more and to open to more of, to have more intimacy with some object, some erotic object (either in everyday <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> or in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, intrapsychically). Note that this is multidimensional, multifaceted. We're not just talking about a mental faculty here - I'll come back to this, but some kind of _vitakka-vicāra_ thing where you're just probing the object. I'll come back to that relationship. First of all, it's not just mental. It involves all the senses. And it's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">embodied</a></span>, which doesn't mean that it needs to manifest in action. More importantly, and this is where the definition starts to get bigger, it involves and it pulls in and stimulates the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> and the ideational. So actually when we talk about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, we're talking about something that includes the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> and the ideational in certain ways, in ways that expand them and moves towards <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. So <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is the ninth term<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > 9 Eros" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#9 Eros" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-2
###### 9-3
**(10)** And you can see <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is one kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, if we use that word, **<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>**, as the tenth term. And <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, we can maybe use it in a way that's more neutral, or as a more broad term, perhaps similar to the Pali word _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="chanda" class="internal-link">chanda</a></span>_. So <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> would then include <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> as a subset in the way that we've just described. When it does that, when the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> is of that kind, it's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. But <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> would also include <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and these kind of words we've used before, which I'll come to in a minute. But the tenth is just <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> as kind of a broad term of which there are different kinds, and it's kind of a neutral term<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > 10 Desire" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#10 Desire" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-3
###### 9-4
**(11)** That word, **<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>**, is the eleventh. We'll come back to this more. I'm going to say <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> is a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> that does _not_ lead to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. Actually, it leads to a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a></span> is an opening movement, and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> brings <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span>. As I said, you can actually feel that in the being, in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Energy body" class="internal-link">Energy body</a></span>, in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, and in lots of other ways, which we'll go into. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a></span> brings _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>,_ in the way that _we_ might use it, okay? So to distinguish <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, different kinds of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. But <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> is the eleventh term<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > 11 Craving" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#11 Craving" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-4
###### 10-1
**(12)** Maybe if I use the term **<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>** as the twelfth term, what I'm really referring to is that whole spectrum that I talked about in the first few talks, where you're really talking about something that can be very, very gross, gripping, like, "Don't leave me! I need you!", that kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, to something really, really subtle, talking about actually _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_, just the belief, the unconscious assumption, that this thing (whatever this thing is, this emotion, this fingernail, this foot) is me or mine, unconsciously, without even thinking about it, or even the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_ that this thing (whatever this thing is, this moment of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedanā</a></span>_ or this lamp in front of me) has inherent existence. That _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ignorance" data-href="Ignorance" class="internal-link">avijjā</a></span>_ is a very subtle level of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. It's wrapped up in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, because the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> needs to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a></span> in a very subtle way to actually perceive anything. But <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, we might use it to refer to that whole spectrum in that broader sense. Okay, so that's the twelfth term, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > 12 Clinging" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#12 Clinging" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-1
###### 10-2
**(13)** The thirteenth term is ... I have to apologize here; I've used it already, **libido**, and I've already used it inconsistently, so apologies. [laughs] In a way, it's because it's not, for me - at least not yet - that important a term. So apologies, and just to note I have been inconsistent. Sometimes I might use it in a way that's almost equivalent to the way I'm using <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, and I think that's the way <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="James Hillman" class="internal-link">James Hillman</a></span> likes to use it. Sometimes I might use it that way. I'm also thinking about using it to mean more something like libido as the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">embodied</a></span>, directed, intentional flow of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Eros" data-href="Eros" class="internal-link">life force</a></span> into any area or domain. So that might be a stream of creativity, or work, or a relationship, or building something, or whatever. It might be a stream. It might be a trickle. It might be a torrent<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > 13 Libido" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#13 Libido" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-2
###### 10-3
In a way, it refers to psychic <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, and the way that can be employed in different ways. I think that's equivalent to how <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Carl Gustav Jung" data-href="Carl Gustav Jung" class="internal-link">Jung</a></span> used the term, but I also read something recently where he sort of said that, and then said something else: "But I don't mean it like that." But he didn't really explain the alternative, and I couldn't find anything else, so I'm not sure how he uses it. But it is a term that people use. For <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sigmund Freud" data-href="Sigmund Freud" class="internal-link">Freud</a></span>, I think it was just the pleasure principle, in a way, or the instinct that came out of the id, the sort of pool of animalistic instincts, if you like, and the force, often guided by the pleasure principle and maybe other things, and that's the libido. Sometimes <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sigmund Freud" data-href="Sigmund Freud" class="internal-link">Freud</a></span> referred to it that way. For other people, it literally means sexual urge or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. And there's also, some of you will know (I'm going to return to this) a psychoanalyst - I think he was very active in the fifties and sixties, possibly - Scottish, called <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ronald Fairbairn" data-href="Ronald Fairbairn" class="internal-link">Fairbairn</a></span>. He used libido in a way that sounds, at first, similar to the way we're using <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>: a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> to connect. It sounds similar, but actually I'm going to point out some differences later on in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. So libido, people use it in very different ways. Sorry I've already been sloppy and inconsistent there. All I can say is maybe the sloppiness and fluidity in the way I'm using it just reflects its etymology, which I've already said: libido, libation, liquid. This is the etymology. It's liquidy. So I'm quite fluid in my definitions. That's a pretty lame excuse! But I don't think we'll be using it much anyway. Anyway, apologies. That's the thirteenth term<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > Libido as psychic energy" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Libido as psychic energy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-3
###### 10-4
**(14)** The fourteenth term is **<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>**. One meaning of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>, in the way that I use it, is just really the totality of the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="citta" class="internal-link">citta</a></span>_, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>. In other words, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, but not reduced to the thinking <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>; just the whole totality of _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="citta" class="internal-link">citta</a></span>_. But another kind of inflection of the meaning means especially '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>,' so using it equivalently with '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>,' in the way that I defined '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>' earlier in this talk, as the sort of organ of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal perception</a></span>. So <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span> as the organ of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal perception</a></span>. But there's a second way that I use it sometimes, and by '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>' I mean the totality of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal perceptions</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Carl Gustav Jung" data-href="Carl Gustav Jung" class="internal-link">Jung</a></span> actually says <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span> _is_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. I'm using it sometimes as the totality of the _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="citta" class="internal-link">citta</a></span>;_ more often as the equivalent with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, the organ of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal perception</a></span>; but quite a few times I will use it as the totality of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal perceptions</a></span>, so it's almost interchangeable with '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>.' ^10-4
###### 11-1
**(15)** **<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Logos" class="internal-link">Logos</a></span>**. So there's another Greek word - your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Logos" class="internal-link">Logos</a></span>, I'm using that to refer to a concept or an idea, or a whole <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>. In other words, what we're elaborating here is a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>, but _any_ concept or _any_ idea or _any_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span> is a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>. For example, when I say 'the autonomy of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a></span>,' as if they have a degree of being independent of me, that's a concept. It's an idea. It's a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span> that's operating in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span> - even at the same time as we know it's a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span>, which is another <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>. So you can have mixtures of concepts operating at any time. If I reduce the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a></span> to, let's say, it's the product of random neuronal firings, or conditioned neuronal firings, or it's expressing something from my childhood, or it's expressing an aspect of my being, this kind of reduction of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a></span> - _any_ kind of reduction - involves a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span> in operation<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > 15 Logos - any concept idea conceptual framework" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#15 Logos - any concept idea conceptual framework" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-1
###### 11-2
Any idea of causality (that _this_ is a result of _that_ in the past, for instance) is also a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>, a concept operating. Another alternative would be what's called _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="telos" class="internal-link">telos</a></span>_, another Greek word. You're learning a lot of Greek on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>! <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Telos" class="internal-link">Telos</a></span> refers to almost like causality from the future. I've talked about this, I think, on the last <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>.^[E.g. Rob Burbea, "The Gift and the Artifice of Self (Part 2)" (1 Aug. 2016), [https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/3702](https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/37020)] That's a different <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>, a different concept operating: that the future, something, so to speak, from the future, beckons us and shapes the present. Very different idea, very different <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>. If we talk about the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> (which is something we'll come back to), that's a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Neuroscience" class="internal-link">Neuroscience</a></span> as a whole is a whole <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>, is a whole <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>.

By '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptuality</a></span>' and '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>,' I include thought structures and thoughts, but it goes way deeper than that. There's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptuality</a></span> operating even when there's no thought whatsoever. And oftentimes, the concepts operating are just assumed, not really checked out, and oftentimes they're operating - most of the time they're operating without us really being conscious of what they are. But when I talk about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>, because it's wrapped up in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, I'm not talking about something abstract. We _live_ a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>, or we live logoi. We live different ideas. Different concepts shape how we live, they inform how we live, but more fundamentally, they shape our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. They're part of, they're included in, the way we look at everything, and therefore what we perceive, what appears to us. So they have massive influence. I'm not talking about abstract ideas here.

Those are interchangeable terms. Now, I'm going to devote quite a lot of time to that on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, but what it really means is that the 'more,' the wanting more that we talked about with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> - more connection, more opening, opening to more of the erotic object, penetrating more, to know more, to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> more - this wanting more, that push there, if you like, or wish to open more to the erotic object, that starts bringing in, inseminating, influencing, expanding the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span> in relation to that object (in other words, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal perception</a></span> of that object) so more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span> is created and discovered in that object.

So there's an expansion of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>. They become richer, more complicated, deeper, wider. There's an expansion of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, and also of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>. In other words, my whole idea of who they are, my idea then of what a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> is and what <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> is, that gets expanded as well. This is really, really important. When it gets expanded, they are then more yummy to me, more interesting, more attractive. It increases the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> there. And so there's a kind of self-feeding, self-generating, ongoing fertilization, mutual fertilization of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>; mutual widening, deepening, enriching, complicating, adding <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span>, etc., that goes on.

So this is something, I would say, that we start to notice in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>, that as we go into <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span> we start to see that it begins to spill over.

There are infinite possibilities for <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a></span>. More typical ones involve a kind of universal <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a></span>, in the sense that - for example, meditating a lot on _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>,_ eventually, at some point, a meditator will have the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> that the world is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmos</a></span> is shot through with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>.

The whole world becomes this particular, or a manifestation of, or flavoured with this particular <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a></span> and his/her/its characteristics, its particularities. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">Cosmopoesis</a></span> - note that word, -_poesis_, in contrast to -_logy_. Cosmo_logy_ is a word that people know. '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">Cosmology</a></span>' means the study of the science of the universe. So we go and we hear about Big Bangs and all that stuff, which is - I <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> it; it's absolutely fascinating to me. The difference between '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmology</a></span>' and '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a></span>' is the absence of a truth claim that goes with the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a></span>. So we're recognizing that this is a creation of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>, or a better word is 'participation.' ^12-4

So there's a participatory aspect of a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a></span>, of the reality-creating. And also, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a></span> - we're talking about poetic truths, if you like, here, which is something I've talked about before, which is different than the usual notion of scientific truth. This, also, I've talked about before; there's a whole - you know, really going into the philosophy of science and what's true and what's a model, etc., and all that. And also to point out that when I use the words - I was contrasting _poiesis_ and _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>_, but actually when I use the word '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>' in the way _we're_ using it, we're not making a truth claim, other than that everything is empty, and even _that_, actually, you let go of at a certain point.

Just to say a little bit about that word. You know, standard <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> will bring experiences of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span> of certain kinds - a whole range, actually. Various experiences of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>, mystical experiences, I would say would be inevitable for meditators meditating with dedication and consistently with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> techniques and approaches, etc. For example, that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awareness" data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">big awareness</a></span> thing, everything is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, or everything is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> - it really _feels_ like there is a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span> to that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. The <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmos</a></span> is shot through with a divine <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. This <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> has somehow the sense [of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>]. People often talk, though they never have before, they start talking in theistic terms, almost surprising to themselves, when those kinds of very common experiences happen. I would say certain kinds of practices, I can put people in a room, get them to do these practices, and it's just a matter of time until these very standard experiences of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span> open up, and people almost inevitably start using that language<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > Insight Meditation will bring experiences of divinity" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Insight Meditation will bring experiences of divinity" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-4

So the question is, if these experiences open up, even in standard <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span>, what is the attitude to these experiences? What's the relationship to them? How are we interpreting them? How are we conceptualizing them? A person might be told, or might hear, or might think, "Well, all experiences are <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span>. Don't think about them. Don't get attached to them. Don't try and repeat them." We touched on this earlier. That's useful sometimes. _Sometimes_ that's useful, to let go when it's too tight, the kind of gripping, the attachment. But mostly it's not that helpful as a kind of attitude or a way of relating to these kind of experiences. It's not quite intelligent enough.

So when we say '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>,' I'm leaving it quite broad, but really talking about a whole range of experiences there. Again, some may be universal in character and impersonal in character, and some may be very particular, and some are related to particularities and theophanies, etc., and some will be personal, a personal god, an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a></span> as a personal god and not an impersonal deity.

**(20)** And the last one that I may use is **<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a></span>**. In the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddhism" data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhist tradition</a></span>, this is a term that has a wide range of usage and arguments and all kinds of stuff. Some traditions use it in quite a narrow way: it just actually is your capacity to become fully <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightened</a></span>, to become a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>, usually over many lifetimes, just by virtue of the fact that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, and the factors of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, and the contents of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> are <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span>. So although there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span> right now, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span> is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span>.

In some meanings of the word <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a></span>, it just refers to that. It's just your kind of unavoidable, no matter what you think of yourself, or where you are actually at in terms of your (quote) 'spiritual development,' there is always and undestroyably the possibility of becoming a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>. That's one usage. Sometimes, in more popular usage nowadays, it just kind of refers to your innate goodness. So if you think you're a mean person, and you see lots of not-so-nice stuff, then it's just a kind of way of saying that in you, at your core, is something bright and luminous and good, inherently good, inherently loving. If I use the term, I probably use it as just an alternative to the word God, in fact, or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>, which I'm using in a much more broad way, just because oftentimes the words God or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span> really rub people the wrong way, and especially some Buddhists. So we can use it, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a></span>, but in a different way than just that possibility. I'm actually talking about something that's divine. And again, it has a range of meanings<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > Buddha-nature refers to something divine" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Buddha-nature refers to something divine" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-4

Perhaps the most sort of full-on meaning, if you like, is from the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Shentong" data-href="Shentong" class="internal-link">Shentong tradition</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tibetan Buddhism" data-href="Tibetan Buddhism" class="internal-link">Tibetan tradition</a></span>. Actually, it's a tradition that goes back to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a></span> Indian <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhism</a></span>. In that tradition, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a></span> is interchangeable with words like _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharmakaya" data-href="Dharmakaya" class="internal-link">dharmakāya</a></span>_, and actually even the word <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, which is used differently when they use it in that tradition from the way I'm using it. So <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a></span>, _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharmakaya" data-href="Dharmakaya" class="internal-link">dharmakāya</a></span>_, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, the Absolute, and other words (there are quite a few words that are used interchangeably), means something like the cosmic <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> that is inherently in me and in you and in everything, that knows the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of all things</a></span>, is not separate (as separating subjects and objects). In that sense, it's non-dual. It refers, then, to the knowing - which is also empty; this knowing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> is empty in itself - but the knowing and_ the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">appearances</a></span> _and_ their <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. All that, known in a kind of non-dual way. In other words, it includes the whole <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmos</a></span> as this kind of field of empty <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> knowing all things and also the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of all things</a></span>. So everything is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a></span>, everything has <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a></span>, everything _is_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a></span>, everything is _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharmakaya" data-href="Dharmakaya" class="internal-link">dharmakāya</a></span>_ in that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>, in that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > Buddha-nature according to Shentong" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Buddha-nature according to Shentong" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-5
