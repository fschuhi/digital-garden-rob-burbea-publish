Summary: [[Eros Unfettered Part 5 - Otherness and the Art of Disappearing]]

---
<br/>

###### 1-1
Let us pick up a couple of threads we have already touched on and take them a little further, elaborate them a little more, weave them together a little more, regarding this whole [[soulmaking dynamic]]. So one of the things we said quite early on was that the way we are defining [[eros]] - and these definitions are not about who is right and who is wrong or whatever - but the way we are defining eros is not the way some people have defined it historically and some people still do, which I think comes from the Neoplatonic tradition. We are not defining it as or saying that it is a drive or force to [[Samadhi|unification]], to union. Rather, or in contrast to that, we have been saying that eros, in the way that we are using that word, eros as we define it, preserves and creates or discovers twoness. ^1-1
###### 1-2
So it is not an inclination, a movement to [[oneness]], to melting, to [[Samadhi|unification]]. Rather, if we pay [[attention]] to this thing, this aspect of our [[experience]], of a [[Phenomenology|phenomenological]] movement that we can observe that we are calling [[eros]], we can see that eros preserves and creates or discovers twoness. Why? Because eros is in the service of and is part of the [[soulmaking]] movement, the [[soulmaking dynamic]], the dynamic of eros-psyche-logos. And soulmaking, as we have also said and explained, as we can observe in our experience, soulmaking brings an increase of otherness, an increase of the other. The other swells, it gets extended, expanded in breadth, in depth, in [[dimensionality]], starts to become more complicated and reveal more facets, more manifold facets. [[Delineations|Distinctions]] are made in the erotic movement or through the erotic soulmaking movement. Distinctions are made of [[perception]] and of conception, of [[psyche]] and [[logos]], within, if you like, the other, or of others. ^1-2
###### 1-3
So we can see then and understand how [[eros]] does indeed preserve and create and discover twoness and otherness, the twoness meaning the two of self and other. But we might [[wonder]], then, well, what about the [[desire]] for [[oneness]]? What about this desire that we have, or many human beings have, for oneness? So that avenue of oneness, of dissolving, of merging into union, unions of different kind, that, I want to say, that is important. And I think for many people interested in [[meditation]] that is an important pull, call in the [[soul]]. But at the same time, the avenue of twoness is important. So both these avenues, of oneness and of twoness, if we say this erotic avenue preserving the twoness, they are both important. I want to say we can have both. We can have both. We can know both. ^1-3
###### 1-4
But let us go into this a little more. Because if we actually examine personally the [[desire]] for [[oneness]], and sometimes it is even a longing for oneness, what actually is it? I would say, on inspection, it is actually a desire to know oneness of some kind, a oneness of [[love]] or of beingness or [[awareness]] or whatever, or a desire to know the [[Unfabricated]], which is another kind of oneness, we could say. So desire to know. It is not so much a desire to become one with that oneness or the Unfabricated or to dissolve into a permanent union. So it is a desire to know something, not to dissolve permanently into some union. This is interesting. In the classic [[Pali Canon]] texts, as well as other spiritual contemplative traditions, religious traditions from around that time and before and afterwards, the kind of ultimate goal of [[Dharma|the path]] could be construed as exactly that - some kind of permanent dissolution or union, ending of the [[rebirth]], of a separate existence, and either permanent union with [[Brahman]] or whatever, or, so to speak, dissolution into the Unfabricated, something like that. ^1-4
###### 1-5
So classically it is there, stated as a goal. But nowadays, or even then, as a sort of permanent, "this is the ending of all [[rebirth]], permanently dissolved or unified," or however exactly one would phrase it, something like that, I would wonder, was that [[desire]], is that desire, there because it is taught to be the goal, or because it is really desired, or because it is actually a movement of [[aversion]], of subtle aversion (something we will come back to later on the [[retreat]]), [[Craving|vibhava-tanha]], desire, lust for nonexistence, for erasing everything, turning existence and the world and self off, turning it all off, turning [[experience]] off. ^1-5
###### 2-1
In actual [[meditation]], actual practice, actual spiritual practice, what is possible is all kinds of dissolution, if you like, to relative degrees. All kinds of unions, unifications. All kinds of experiences of melting into [[oneness]], whether it is different levels of [[jhanas]], of the eight jhanas, or different experiences of the [[brahmaviharas]], dissolving into [[love]]. All kinds are possible. And even what is called an [[experience]] of the cessation of [[perception]] in an experience of the [[Unfabricated]]. These are all available as temporary meditative experiences. One learns how to do that, develops that art, skill, at whatever level of jhana or in whatever direction, to the Unfabricated or whatever, and, so to speak, dips into the dissolution temporarily and then hopefully - and sometimes it is a gradual process - one then emerges from that and knows a level of essential union, unity, if you like, an essential oneness with whatever it is, an infinite love or infinite [[consciousness]] or something like that, or even somehow the Unfabricated. ^2-1
###### 2-2
So one moves in a world experiencing twoness but actually knowing [[oneness]]. So one can, meditatively, with practice, practicing the right way, finding out how, developing that art, one can dissolve in different ways to different degrees and into different kinds of oneness, if you like, and emerge. And emerging, hopefully, in time, and with some reflective [[insight]], we know something. We know an essential oneness. You could say something like that. But knowing implies already some kind of [[Nondualism|duality]] or polarity, at least, of knower and known. Knowing, if you like, already implies or is already a state of some degree of twoness, knower and known. There is the knower and there is what is known. There is the [[consciousness]] that knows and there is that which is known. Some degree, different ways, different kinds, and to different degrees. ^2-2
###### 2-3
So what does the spiritual seeker want in wanting [[oneness]], in longing for oneness? He/she wants to know that she is one essentially with God, with universal [[love]], universal [[awareness]], universal beingness, with the [[dharmakaya]], whatever, at different levels of [[Insight|understanding]] and [[perception]] of oneness. But she wants to know that essentially she is one. And that is different than a [[desire]] to dissolve and have that union as a sort of permanent thing. Similarly, you know, in [[tantra]], and we talked I think in the last [[retreat]], the [[Re-enchanting the Cosmos]] retreat, about becoming the deity, becoming the [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]] as a kind of option in imaginal practice, and also as a kind of direction or instruction in tantric practice. But that becoming the deity, becoming the imaginal figure, first of all it is never total. It is never a complete union, dissolving all sense of distinction. And secondly, it is only temporary. Realistically, it is only temporary. ^2-3
###### 2-4
This is important to actually scrutinize a little bit this [[desire]] for [[oneness]] and what is actually happening in the spiritual and meditative openings, perceptual openings of experiences of oneness and union, dissolution, merging and all that, or in life, with a lover or whatever it is, or the flow of life in doing a sport or whatever. We will return to this later in the [[retreat]], this desire for oneness, for transcendence, for the [[Unfabricated]]. There is quite a lot involved in that, and what is the place of that on our path, that desire for oneness, transcendence, and for the Unfabricated, et cetera. But for now, let us say [[eros]] will retain and engender, or works to both retain and actually engender twoness. And it will move towards doing that even at the same time or while it knows oneness, or onenesses, because there are many varieties and many, as I said, levels of oneness. ^2-4
###### 2-5
So the kind of general, overall movement of [[soulmaking]] and the thrust that comes from [[eros]] will work to essentially, overall, retain and engender twoness, but also unfold [[oneness]], and eventually there is experiences, it becomes quite possible, the [[perception]] is a sense of twoness, of erotically-charged twoness and otherness at the same time as one knows and can sense a oneness, or many onenesses of different levels, different varieties. And again, eventually it is quite possible to modulate the emphasis in the [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] or in the [[meditation]] or in the [[experience]] that one's involved with, to actually modulate it towards the melting, towards [[Unfabricated|the unfabricating]] - we have touched on this - or towards retaining the twoness, what am I drawing out of perception, how am I inclining the unfolding of the experience. This is all very possible with the development of just the art of meditation. ^2-5
###### 3-1
But [[eros]] keeps an erotic tension in the relationship, whether it is with a person or something in nature or an [[Image|intrapsychic image]] or whatever. The erotic tension is maintained. And that erotic tension is not just the wanting to act, "Oh, I really want to kiss you," or whatever it is. It is not just wanting sexual consummation, either. Or it is not the tension of the buildup of, say, sexual [[energy]] in the body, or just psychic energy, or [[desire]], or, as we talked about, the tension of [[craving]]. It is not just the tension of energy accumulating in the body or the psychic [[vessel]]. That is not the only facet of the erotic tension. And that might not even be a big aspect of it at all. The erotic tension can be subtle. So it is not just wanting to act, it is not just wanting sexual consummation, it is not just the tension of energy, it is not just the tension for desiring union. Erotic tension that is kind of, we could say, intrinsic to the [[soulmaking]] erotic movement is this desire for the other, desire to know and [[experience]], touch the other, that is always more, there is always more of that desire. ^3-1
###### 3-2
So there is a tension because there is always more. It is inherent in the pothos of the [[eros]], that goes with the eros. And also because the object is always becoming more through the insemination, impregnation that eros gives to the whole [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]] process, [[soulmaking]] process. So the object always becomes more, there is always more to [[desire]], more to know, more to [[experience]]. Does not collapse into [[oneness]]. So there is an erotic tension just because there is always this desire for more and there is always the two. ^3-2
###### 3-3
So [[eros]] creates otherness, or we could say it creates othernesses, because it creates also different aspects or whole kind of ranges of othernesses within one object, even. Creates and discovers otherness. We could say eros needs otherness. The erotically-charged object is an other for eros. And wrapped up in that and the [[experience]], again just [[Phenomenology|phenomenologically]] observing the whole experience of eros, of [[soulmaking]], there is a fascination with the other. There is the sense, the [[perception]] of the [[beauty]] of the other. The other is, as we have been saying, an [[image]], [[fantasy]]. So they need to be imaginally alive for us. The other is an image and a fantasy, and image and fantasy are needed as part of the eros, as we have been saying. And this kind of space, if you like, of mystery or not yet or unknown yet, the space in which the whole process, the whole thrust or opening of eros can discover or create more of the object. So both the image, replete with its different facets and its beauty and the fascination with that, and also the fascination, the attraction of the space of mystery, the not-as-yet in which we can discover and create more of the object. All this is part of the experience of eros and soulmaking eros. ^3-3
###### 3-4
So in relation to the opening to levels of [[oneness]] in [[meditation]] and mystical [[experience]], what that means then, what we have just said is that on the way to, or aspiring to, or practicing towards, in the process of learning to open to or discovering a level of oneness, [[eros]] is there. There is fascination. I want to know cosmic [[consciousness]], let us say. I want to open to it and discover it. There is fascination. There is the [[beauty]], perhaps, of hearing about it or sensing it vaguely but not quite yet. It exists for us as an [[image]]. There is all kinds of [[fantasy]] involved in that. And there is the space to move into it because it has mystery yet, I do not quite know it, it has depth and potential there, it is unknown. So all those aspects are there. That oneness, whatever level of oneness we are talking about, or it is the [[Unfabricated]] or whatever, is an erotic object then for the [[soul]], if you like. ^3-4
###### 3-5
But [[eros]] needs the polarity and it constellates an erotic tension. Something else is interesting in the [[experience]] of eros, and you can see this sometimes more easily in actual relationship with another person where there is a sustained eros and the [[beauty]] of [[soulmaking]] in the relationship - but maybe with [[Imaginal|imaginal figures]], too, or imaginal objects, like even this [[oneness]] somehow - that this twoness, this sense of otherness, can exist in the larger sort of experience of eros, in the soulmaking field, the twoness and otherness can be experienced, and the erotic tension, and the polarity of all that, can be experienced alongside - let us say alongside, rather than within, but maybe within - alongside or within a third. If you like, there is the us, or the we. So there is [[the self]] and the other and the eros between them and the aliveness of each as [[image]] and erotic object, and then sometimes what happens is the soulmaking process, when it gets rich enough, constellates a third. One of the things, that third can be the us. So there is the you and the me, and then there is the us, almost as if it is a third [[soul]] that gets constellated, gets discovered or created. What is the soul of we, the soul of us that is constellated by the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]] expanding, enriching, finding, creating, discovering, revealing more? ^3-5
###### 4-1
So this we then, this us, is not so much a merging into union but an integrated constellation of the two. The very us, the two, makes another kind of one that is made up of the two, if you like. There is the [[soul]] of me and you in relationship. We come together. It is not that we merge into one. I feel me, and I feel you, and both of those are alive as erotic objects, myself also, which we will return to, but also there seems to be a third born, we. You and I make a kind of larger soul together. But it is not a collapsing into union. And/or there is some kind of [[birth]] - so that could be regarded as a birth; there is the birth of the soul of us, of we, and the [[experience]] of that. I am not going to go too much into it right now. Or there is the actual birth of a child. Sometimes that is where the [[eros]] and the [[soulmaking]] goes or is supported by the birth of a child, or it could be a birth of a work project that the two are involved in, or something both parties, if you like, can [[love]] or invest in. So out of the eros between the two, some kind of third is born or emerges. Could be the third of the we, the us; could be the third of an actual child; could be the third of a creative project. And that becomes a new erotic object, if you like, or a further erotic object, becomes a channel for the eros and the soulmaking. ^4-1
###### 4-2
So all these facets can kind of coexist at the same time as different [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] or aspects, facets, of the whole [[soulmaking]] process. They kind of emerge. One recognizes them as the whole movement of soulmaking deepens, widens, and expands, and refines. And I would say because of this kind of comprehensive movement of the [[soulmaking dynamic]] to sort of flow in every possible direction, fill everything out, impregnate everything, [[eros]] also will lead to recognizing essential [[oneness]] with the other, or all kinds of different oneness as we said before. The very erotic movement, if it is allowed to unfold, part of what it will do is it will lead us to eventually recognize onenesses of different kinds. It will open those mystical experiences. ^4-2
###### 4-3
But in the actual [[experience]] of [[eros]] with another person or [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]], it is not that [[oneness]] that is predominantly emphasized, or for the most part. Actually it is not even necessary to have that knowledge or sense of oneness. It is not necessary to eros. It is just that eros, as I said, in fertilizing the [[soulmaking dynamic]], eros-psyche-logos, eventually that soulmaking dynamic will uncover, reveal, recognize oneness as part of it. But it is not the dominant aspect and it is not what is emphasized at the times that eros is to the fore. ^4-3
###### 4-4
So [[eros]] needs the [[perception]] of otherness to remain. It does not want to dissolve it, because the otherness is what entices. If you like, the scope or the size, if you like, or the range, the depth, the complexity, the multifacetedness, the multidimensionality of the perception of the other, that is what we are saying is equivalent to the [[image]], the [[psyche]], if you like, in the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]]. That is the otherness that needs to remain and gets built. So in igniting and stoking the [[soul]] fires of eros, psyche, and [[logos]], eros, we could say, creates or discovers the other, an other, or otherness, or othernesses. But it creates otherness that it [[Desire|desires]] to contact, to know, to [[experience]], et cetera. So eros creates more attractive others, if you like, that stimulate more eros - we have said this before - rather than creating others that we then feel alienated from or aversive to. ^4-4
###### 4-5
So there is all kinds of implications for what we are saying now, and we will return to these threads, we will pick them up later, as I mentioned. But what it implies is that what some people call the art of disappearing - so Ajahn Brahm, I think, has a book called The Art of Disappearing, disappearing into [[Jhanas|jhana]] or just getting rid of [[the self]] or erasing the self or experiences of, quote, "[[Anatta|no self]]," or [[emptiness]], or that kind of thing, or other kinds of art of disappearing, actually, valuable as they are, and important as they are as experiences, temporary experiences on [[Dharma|the path]], in the unfolding of [[insight]] and [[beauty]] and mystical awarenessses and opening of [[perception]], the art of disappearing is not [[eros]]. Eros is not the art of disappearing. They are different, if you like. Or you can not reduce one to the other. Eros is not the movement of disappearing, and certainly not disappearing finally. ^4-5
###### 5-1
All these aspects that we have been talking about, all these pieces that we have been talking about, the recognition of the [[oneness]], the knowing of the oneness, the sense of the twoness being retained, the sense even of a third, of something being born from the erotic connection of the two, even the kind of mutual [[emptiness]] of self and other, object, [[imaginal]] object, all of that actually is kind of implicit in the concept of participation. Participation. This is something I think I have touched on very briefly before, but to me it is, in all kinds of ways, a very powerful idea. But more even than an idea or a concept, it is actually a sense, again, that is opened for us if [[eros]] is allowed to do its thing and stimulate the [[soulmaking]], there is not a hindering, a blocking, a cramping, a [[constriction]], a refusal, a dismissal from any side of the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos]] kind of tripod. ^5-1
###### 5-2
So we begin to have a sense of participation, participating in the we, participating eventually in the universe but at much more than just a material level. So I participate in the universe by breathing in and out, or I participate by eating and urinating and defecating or whatever, I participate culturally to whatever extent that I do, I participate in the community that I am in, the communities that I am in, I participate in society by voting, by writing letters politically, socially, et cetera - all that is important and it is participation. There is a way that one can see the [[beauty]] of all that. But there is depths of profundity and comprehensiveness to this concept and sense of participation that [[eros]] will unfold. It is not just an idea. We could start with the idea of it, but eros will unfold, for instance, what eventually we feel like we are participating - my mind, which means my thoughts, my creativity, my [[Insight|insights]], my playing with certain ideas. My mind is participating in the mind of God, if you like, or the mind of the [[Buddha-nature]]. My individual mind or the micro-movements of my mind. Participating in the [[soul]], if you like, of the divine, the eros of the divine, or in the soul of the other, or in the world soul. ^5-2
###### 5-3
As I said, as the [[eros]] is allowed to expand and fertilize the [[perception]], fertilize the [[psyche]], fertilize the ideation, we get a sense of other [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] to the different aspects of our being, and a sense that we are participating in those other dimensions. They are not separate from us. It is not that we are just one. It is not that it is just two, either. And there is a sense of a third, this participation is creating a third, something is being born of my participation in the divine, something is being born by the divine, if you like, using me and my particular [[personhood]], all my particularities. I asked, I think it was in the last talk or the one before, whose eros is this? Whose psyche is this? Whose [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]] is this? Whose idea is this? Whose [[conceptual framework]]? These begin to be questions that come to the fore. They emerge out of the very [[soulmaking]] process. We can have a sense, a deepening sense of mystical participation. As I said, participation is a big word, and I think anyone with a little reflection would, as I say, it becomes obvious that we participate in all kinds of ways. But there is depths to that and levels of what that can mean to us and the [[beauty]] of what it can mean, the beauty of the sense of it. ^5-3
###### 5-4
Because in participation, the idea or the sense of participation, as I said, it is got a kind of [[oneness]] in it, implicit in it, but it also retains the twoness, and it keeps the threeness, or the [[birth]] of the third, if you like. And in it, my particulars, your particulars, the particular of whatever erotic object I am connected to, opening to, engaged with, the particulars are sacralized in that participation and as particulars they are sacralized. In other words, my particular - my bones, or this thought or whatever, it is not just sacralized because, as I said, its essence is equal with the essence of everything else in being universal whatever, play of [[awareness]] or universal [[love]] or something. Particulars, my particulars, your particulars, the particulars of the erotic beloved, are sacralized as particulars in this sense of participation. You understand? Because the participation needs the particulars. Part-icipation. Part. The part is not just all the same; it cannot be replaced, my uniqueness, your uniqueness. And that uniqueness is itself unfolding, and that is part of the participation. ^5-4
###### 5-5
Can you get a sense? It is a different kind of mysticism, if you like. It does not replace the [[oneness]] and the knowing of universal essence, but it is a different sense and a different concept. When we say things like that, and in fact wrapped up in everything - well, actually wrapped up in everything, literally, but also wrapped up in all [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]] and all this talk about [[eros]] and re-enchantment and all that, but indeed wrapped up in anything that we might want to take as a subject in our existence - is the question of [[epistemology]], the question of how do we know what is true or what is real, or how do we know anything, what can we rely on there. So epistemology is the philosophy of knowing, of knowledge, if you like. Actually, forgive me, I am using that word epistemology right now in a way that kind of includes the implicit questions of [[ontology]] wrapped up in it, so really one word to embrace all that. Ontology is the branch of philosophy that deals with the question of reality, of what is real, of the, if you like, reality status of things, anything, of this or that, how real is it, if we could say, or what kind of reality does this or that have, et cetera. So as I said - yeah, just for shorthand, using that word epistemology to embrace all that, that whole nexus and flow of questioning, all that investigation into [[Ways of Looking|ways of knowing]] and their validity and their domains and the whole question of reality. So just a kind of shorthand term there. ^5-5
###### 6-1
So this is wrapped up, as I said, in what we have just been talking about, the sense of [[Divinity|sacredness]], et cetera, and the whole notion of the viability, the validity of [[Imaginal|imaginal perception]], when we are talking about [[eros]], all of it. It is wrapped up in [[insight]] into anything - into [[emptiness]], even into [[impermanence]]. Wrapped up in our existence, even if we do not think and we are not philosophers at all. So this is important. We are saying these things about sacredness and this and that, and what are we saying about that in terms of its philosophical ground, if you like, the [[epistemology]]? Well, first of all, as practitioners interested in opening up the field of our explorations - I do not know why else you would be here - but as practitioners interested in opening up the field of exploration, interested in opening up regions of [[soul]] and of [[soulmaking]], I would say we recognize and we admit openly that we grant an [[image]] its sacredness, its divine [[Dimensionality|dimensions]], its autonomy. Remember I was talking about the image has, in our view, an imaginal image has a certain autonomy. But we acknowledge that this is something that we grant the image. We grant it, through the [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] or through the concept operating in the moment, the [[logos]] operating in the moment, through the way of looking we grant it sacredness, divine dimensions, autonomy. Without that, it cannot have these things for us. ^6-1
###### 6-2
And it is the same with [[eros]]. If you like, we can decide to see it as divine, as autonomous in the way that we are talking about, that it is not my eros, it is the eros coming through me, pushing through me from the divine, from a divine figure or divine level. It is autonomous in that sense. So we can decide to adopt that [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]], that [[conceptual framework]], as part of our way of looking, and see what happens when we do that - I mentioned this much earlier on the [[retreat]] - see what happens when we adopt a certain ideation, a certain [[logos]], and have that actually be in the way of looking. But it is also true, and if you are experimenting with this stuff in practice, you will get this sense it is also that we discover [[Divinity|sacredness]], we discover the divine [[Dimensionality|dimensions]], the dimensionality, the autonomy of [[Image|images]] and of eros - if and when we do not contract around or [[Clinging|cling]] to some conceptual framework or way of looking that simply refuses to admit sacredness, divinity, autonomy. In other words, if we are open and we are not clinging to a certain rigid idea, then we will actually have the [[experience]] of getting a sense of, noticing sacredness, autonomy, divinity, dimensionality, actually revealed in the experience. ^6-2
###### 6-3
So what is it then? Is it that we give it that, we grant it that? That it is just coming from us? Or is it that we discover it? Are both true? Do we create and discover? Is there some kind of amalgam (I think I used the word at one point)? Now, this question in regard to [[Divinity|sacredness]] of the [[imaginal]] and of [[eros]], the [[epistemology]] there is a very similar question to the epistemology in relation to anything. So this is related to much broader epistemological questions regarding all [[experience]], all experience. I would say that in the field of - let us just say for now imaginal practice and the exploration of eros and what we are talking about, and I mean the wider field of imaginal practice, not just intrapsychically but the way that comes into our [[perception]] as well of the world, of self, of other - that we can and we should see it both ways, both that we acknowledge the [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]], if you like, we grant an [[image]] a sense of sacredness, a sense of divinity, a sense of autonomy, a characteristic of autonomy, but we also discover it. Can I move between those two perceptions, those two [[ways of looking]], ideas, if you like? Can I even somehow adopt both at the same time? Yes, I can. ^6-3
###### 7-1
And if we can do that and have that kind of flexibility, this will be the most useful for practice. I think much more mature than plumping for one or the other. But it will be useful in the sense that it will liberate our [[perception]]. It will liberate perceptions, experiences for us. It will open and fertilize that whole [[soulmaking dynamic]], the eros-psyche-logos. It will galvanize the [[soul]], galvanize [[soulmaking]], if we can kind of hold this epistemological question quite skillfully. And this, to me, is a really interesting area. Historically - and I think I have mentioned this on another [[retreat]], other retreats perhaps - probably within all religious traditions and perhaps most philosophical traditions until maybe very recently, within the [[history]] of humanity there have been streams which have wanted to kind of give a kind of independent reality, if you like, to the world of the [[imaginal]] or to what we might call knowledge that is sacred, or sacred knowledge, or something like that. So you get that in Sufism. You get it in many of the Buddhist traditions. In a way, you even get it in the [[Buddha]] of the [[Pali Canon]]. ^7-1
###### 7-2
There was a group in England called the Cambridge Platonists, active in the 17th century, Thomas More and John Smith, et cetera, sort of resurrected Platonism with variations. And wanting to give, or in fact giving a place for the possibility of knowing, in a similar way that we know things through the senses, possibility of knowing immediately in that way - in other words, not by rational deduction; knowing, having sacred knowledge, knowing the mundus imaginalis, Latin for the world of the [[imaginal]]. They are actually just creating a third kind of knowing. So there is rationality and abstract knowledge and there is what was regarded as concrete knowledge - in other words, knowledge that is sensual, through the senses, of external things. But there was a third sort of category of what the Cambridge Platonists called spiritual sensation. It was not to do with thought and making rational deduction. It was not to do with the kind of sensation where I touch this chair or this table or whatever it is, concrete and externally conceived. It was another dimension which had its own kind of immediate sensation, spiritual sensation. ^7-2
###### 7-3
So they kind of gave, if you like, there is this independent reality, the mundus imaginalis, or certain things we can know as sacred, et cetera, and there is a way of knowing that. There is just a third way of knowing that, so that we say it is true if I deduce something logically, from rational deduction, and if my logic is correct then I conclude something is true; it is true if I can touch it and see it and everyone agrees with me; and there is a third kind of it is true if I open and use my faculty of spiritual sensation. But all these things exist independently, if you like. They just need the right tools to uncover them, discover them. So a lot of these traditions, for instance the Sufi tradition, will talk about this way of knowing, this spiritual sensation, this knowing directly of the mundus imaginalis, is available to one who has purified their heart. That word, heart, in Sufism, in Islam, mystical Islam, refers to the organ of [[imaginal]] knowing, not so much the seat of emotion but the organ of imaginal knowing. One who has purified their heart knows what is independently existing as a reality in that way. ^7-3
###### 7-4
And this still goes on, people just kind of asserting "this is real," this kind of knowledge, sacred knowledge or this knowing of what appears in the [[imaginal]], and it is an alternative to kind of Cartesian [[Nondualism|dualism]] of there is just mind or matter, and kind of philosophical positivism where if you can not measure it or see it with your senses it does not exist. So that is one option and it is been very popular and it still is popular with different people and different traditions, et cetera. But there is another - an alternative, I would say, is to recognize that reality, so-called, or [[perception]] is participatory. Our sense of reality or reality itself is participatory. Our [[experience]] is participatory. In other words, we [[Fabrication|fabricate]] experience. We are involved in the fabrication of experience, the fabrication of the sense of reality and the fabrication of what then we deem real. ^7-4
###### 7-5
So this is not going to the extreme of a kind of slightly New Age sort of "all of it is just mind- made, you create your own reality" version, take on things. But neither is it the other extreme of just assuming that things that we perceive exist as they seem to independent of our [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]]. That notion of independent, objective reality has been kind of nailed in its coffin, if you like, for the most part by modern Western philosophy, either of the so-called continental variety or the so-called analytic or Anglo-American variety, from lots of different directions, and philosophy of science, and in lots of different ways. It is not really viable, this sort of basic notion that we have generally, that we are taught really and we feel as an intuition, that things exist objectively, independent of the way of looking, and that was also a kind of axiom and a goal of the [[scientific method]]. That is what it is supposed to do - it is like we can know how things exist objectively, independent of the mind, independent of our biases, independent of our perspectives and all that. ^7-5
###### 8-1
So both in the philosophy of science and wider Western philosophy, et cetera, the naivety of that kind of objective [[realism]] has been, you know, kind of left in tatters. As I said, it is not really viable anymore. And yet, so often even for people who have heard that or read certain things, so often, and often tacitly, people try to build [[Dharma]], or there is an attempt or attempts to build Dharma and the whole [[Conceptual Framework|conceptual structure]] of the Dharma on some kind of realist basis. And either a kind of religious realism that I was alluding to earlier, or a secular modernist realism that might have a materialist basis or it is just "this is reality as it seems to be, and this is what we have to deal with" in the kind of existentialist version of that. It is often on this realist basis, or sometimes a third option which is quite popular among Buddhists who tend to try or aspire to not - at least Western Buddhist often - try to, aspire to, not argue or get into conflict; they just say, "Well, anything's okay. People just believe different things and it is all good, it is all fine. Just do not argue." But in all of that, to me, there is a kind of naivety, an inadequacy of kind of philosophical [[Activism|engagement]] with the issues of [[epistemology]]. So what is more attractive to me is to recognize [[perception]], [[experience]], so-called reality is participatory. It is always participatory. I have gone into this in other talks in terms of quantum physics and other developments in modern philosophy and [[postmodernism]], all kinds of things. So modern philosophy often expresses this [[insight]] to a certain level, but often then does not do much with it, or those who, as I said, have read about it and say, "Yes, yes, I understand," the question is, what do you then do with this insight into, in a way, we could say insight into [[emptiness]], into the emptiness of the inherent existence of things, the recognition that the [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] contributes to the so-called reality, that reality is participatory in that kind of way. ^8-1
###### 8-2
Modern philosophers seem really ill-equipped to do anything with it because they actually do not have meditative training, so the actual [[ways of looking]] are very, very limited in scope. They do not have that range to actually experientially engage different ways of looking and actually open up different cosmoi, cosmoses, whatever the plural is. Or again, they see that [[emptiness]], see the way that reality, so to speak, is constructed, and acknowledge it, but then just revert to a kind of realist philosophy which usually ends up being just the same kind of [[realism]] that [[modernism]], that we are all educated with and indoctrinated with by modernism: there is a real world, it is material, the way we know things goes back to this kind of objective knowledge. Nothing really gets shifted or challenged. There is a reversion. ^8-2
###### 8-3
So this is really interesting to me. Oftentimes it is not stated, of course, because intellectually one knows, "Well, that is not the correct position," but practically speaking, and implicitly conceptually, in weaving a new version of the [[Dharma]] or whatever, it is actually there. So this is interesting to me why this happens, why there is that kind of backing down or reversion or inability to follow through on that level of [[insight]] and open things up. So I think there is a practical reason, to do with meditative skill. There also may be a psychological or psychological reasons that have to do with [[soulmaking]] that I will come back to later on in the [[retreat]]. ^8-3
###### 8-4
I think it was the physicist John Archibald Wheeler who died not too long ago, great physicist of the 20th century, teacher, a student who worked with Niels Bohr, teacher of Richard Feynman and Roger Penrose, wonderful thinker. I think he coined this term, we live in a 'participatory universe.' I think that was his term. Knowing is participatory. Knowledge is participatory. Reality then is participatory. There is not this independent existence, independent of the [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]]. So we participate also in the concepts that we create, [[Conceptual Framework|conceptual frameworks]] also. They are participatory. ^8-4
###### 8-5
One of the kind of ways of approaching this whole [[insight]] into [[emptiness]] philosophically is with the notion of participation, but as I said, it is also something that [[eros]], if we allow it, if we allow it to unfold, if we allow it to stimulate the [[soulmaking]], we will have at some point this sense, this deepening sense I should say, of participation in all its mystical levels and openings and [[Dimensionality|dimensions]]. We will have the sense of it and the idea of it, the concept, the [[logos]] of it will, I think, emerge as an important logos, as a viable logos, and also one that we can plug in and try as a flexible option, you know? And what does all that bring then? Then this sense of participation, this idea of deep, profound participation, what does that itself bring when we open it up as an idea, when we participate in the idea of participation, when we actually have that sense? Well, one of the things that is implicit in it - and I will say it again - from Plato's depiction of Eros as a hermeneutical [[daimon]], daemon (not sure how to pronounce that word); in other words, a demigod, an [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]], if you like, Eros, whose realm is the realm of [[Hermeneutics#Overview|hermeneutics]], of interpretation, of [[Ways of Looking|ways of seeing]], ways of knowing, ways of understanding, ways of perceiving. And this is in regard to everything, everything, everything, in regard to the whole sense and every aspect of existence. How are we seeing it? How are we sensing it? What is it to us? ^8-5
###### 9-1
What it becomes depends on our [[Hermeneutics#Overview|hermeneutics]], and our hermeneutics is stimulated by [[eros]]. So again, it is participation. The idea of participation opens up the hermeneutics, and the recognition of hermeneutics opens up the participation, the recognition of participation. Participate in the creation/discovery of reality. What might all this mean with regard to the [[Dharma]]? If eros, if we regard it with respect, if we do not just pigeonhole it as a fetter, as a defilement, eros will open things up as we have been explaining. And in relation to the Dharma as something we [[love]], as a domain and area that we love, eros will open it up. As the [[soulmaking dynamic]] infuses the Dharma, relates to the Dharma, eros opens it up. Now, you can see this personally, I think. You can also see it historically. This is something I will come back to. ^9-1

In the [[Pali Canon]], the [[Buddha]] said, "Seeing [[impermanence]], one becomes disenchanted. ^9-2
###### 9-3
Disenchanted, one becomes dispassionate. Dispassionate, one is liberated." So we have touched on this before in I think the very first talks, and you can see the [[Insight|wisdom]] there, the process that he is alluding to of renouncing [[clinging]], et cetera, and letting clinging go, and then the [[Awakening|liberation]] that comes up. But with this exploration, or further exploration, exploration sometimes based on insight and deeper insight into [[emptiness]] rather than just [[impermanence]], and also this exploration that opens up through [[eros]] and the [[soulmaking dynamic]], one could also say now, modeling on his statement there or phraseology, one could also say something almost opposite regarding disenchantment and dispassion. One could say now, one could see the validity of saying now, or the possibility of saying now and seeing, recognizing, one could say seeing the emptiness and [[eternality]] of [[Image|images]] - seeing the [[imaginal]] in other words, seeing that image is image, but it has this [[Unfabricated|timelessness]] - seeing the emptiness and eternality of images, the world is re-enchanted. The world and [[the self]] enchanted and empty, one is free to become impassioned. Impassioned, infinite things open infinitely. ^9-3
###### 9-4
Seeing the [[imaginal]], seeing the [[emptiness]] and [[eternality]], the [[Unfabricated|timelessness]] of [[Image|images]], the world is re-enchanted. The world and [[the self]] enchanted and empty, one is free to become impassioned. Impassioned, infinite things open infinitely. In other words, if we allow the [[passion]], the [[eros]], if we allow the [[soulmaking]] of the imaginal, the world is re-enchanted. And in that, infinite things open infinitely. In other words, this soulmaking movement, the way this opens things up, everything, infinite things, and opens them infinitely potentially, potentially infinitely. You can also turn this phrase around, so that, as I said, the passion, the eros, leads to enchantment and the sense of timelessness that comes with images, the eternality. All these aspects - enchantment, eternality, eros - they are mutually dependent, so you could turn that phrase around anyway. ^9-4
###### 9-5
Some of you will be familiar with some [[Vajrayana]] teachings and you can see the connection there or recognize in what I just said, you can recognize something akin to a Vajrayana opening of [[Tantra|tantric]] perspectives, tantric [[Insight|understandings]], tantric project, if you like. So something then happens in the whole sense of what we are seeing the [[Dharma]] is and where it leads and what the possibilities are. Dharma becomes bigger and becomes endless in a certain way. So [[eros]] will extend, will widen, deepen the [[image]], the [[psyche]], and the idea, the [[logos]], of Dharma, just like it will with anything it comes into contact with. And the pothos in the eros will create this endlessness to it. So something, if we allow [[soulmaking]] really fully, maybe something in us eventually recognizes that the [[soul]] needs an endless Dharma, a Dharma that is endless. What does that mean? If [[awakening]], if we kind of are not chained to the mooring of regarding awakening, final awakening, as an [[Rebirth|ending of rebirth]], what does an endless Dharma, what might it mean? ^9-5
###### 10-1
The reduction of my personal [[Dukkha|suffering]] or stress or my neurosis in a kind of rather narrow modernist version of [[Dharma]], it is like that is what [[awakening]] is - that is not endless. It is not big enough, perhaps. How might the Dharma be endless? We will come back to this. But four possibilities occur to me. One is through a much deeper [[Insight|understanding]] of [[emptiness]]. Now, that in itself is not endless. In other words, one perhaps gets to the point where everything is understood to be empty, absolutely everything at a very thorough, deep level, but it is certainly much further than just this aspiration to, as I said, reduce my personal suffering, my stress or my neurosis psychologically. Still not endless, though. However, if one sees [[fabrication]] - going back to some of the original things we were talking about - and then actually sees further that fabrication itself is empty, too, then actually the whole [[Nondualism|duality]] between fabricated and [[unfabricated]], the whole ground of everything is taken away. The whole ground between fabricated and unfabricated, between sacred and profane, all of that, everything is opened up as magical. ^10-1
###### 10-2
And opened up, too, are [[ways of looking]]. As I said, we end up with nothing but ways of looking. And the range of ways of looking is opened, so that, in that, there is a kind of endlessness of exploration of ways of looking. The validity of different ways of looking and the practical possibility of ways of looking is opened, and it is all magical, it is all part of the magical, sacred [[fabrication]] that we can be involved in, participate in. And there is an endlessness of exploring different ways of looking, the [[beauty]] of that. So that might be one way that a [[Dharma]] could be endless. Another way is in the sort of, if you like, the [[Mahayana]] sort of vision of what a [[buddha]] is, what an awakened, [[Awakening|enlightened]] being is. If you know some of the texts, what that involves, to be enlightened in the Mahayana sense, through the 10 or 11 [[Bhumi|bhumis]] to full buddhahood is something so far beyond anything that is realistically possible, as a Sanskrit teacher I had once, Peter [?], said, a Mahayana buddha makes the God of the [[Old Testament]] look like a schoolboy in short trousers. It is so kind of grand and far-out. It is effectively infinite, that level of potential that we are talking about. So there is a kind of [[fantasy]] of [[rebirth]] through this eons and eons of time and a kind of [[cosmology]] there, and that whole, if you like, fantasy - and I am using it in a good sense - there is a kind of endlessness to that fantasy, because realistically no one's going to say, "I am a buddha now." So one's always in that larger cosmological, [[imaginal]] fantasy and the beauty of that direction. So there is a kind of endlessness there. ^10-2
###### 10-3
There is also an endlessness in the kind of more pop, if you like, [[Insight|understanding]] of a [[bodhisattva]] as someone who devotes his life, her [[energy]] and life to serving others, to easing [[Dukkha|suffering]]. So you could say kind of socially or environmentally engaged [[Buddhism]], in that sense, there is a kind of endlessness there. There wo not be an end of social problems, environmental problems to address. So there is an endlessness in that. That is a third possibility of endlessness. And a fourth has to do with [[soulmaking]]. So soulmaking is brought in as and recognized as a kind of fundamental dimension or direction - I think dimension better - of what practice is and what the [[Dharma]] can be. Then that, too, creates an endless Dharma, because soulmaking is endless. Why? Because of exactly what we just said, have been saying for a while now, about the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]] and the way the pothos will push it to create more and more, discover more and more, open more and more, potentially infinitely. ^10-3
###### 10-4
So there is a kind of endlessness there in the integration, the incorporation of a notion of [[soulmaking]] organically into the scope of what the [[Dharma]] is. Now, those four are not necessarily separate at all. You can see that. And we will revisit this. We will revisit this. But if the [[eros]] is strong, deep, then I wonder whether that needs to happen at some point, a sense of a path or a territory that is endless, can accommodate soulmaking. ^10-4
