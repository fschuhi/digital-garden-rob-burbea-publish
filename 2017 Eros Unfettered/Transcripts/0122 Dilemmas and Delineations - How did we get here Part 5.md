Summary: [[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 5]]

---
<br/>

###### 1-1
Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote a lot of things that were sort of addressed to himself, kind of advice to himself and notes to self. One of the things he wrote was, "All things have two handles; beware of the wrong one." I think he - I am not sure, but I think he might have been paraphrasing or even quoting the Greek philosopher Epictetus. But anyway. You can see how that applies to a lot of what we have been talking about so far. It is relevant to [[desire]], how we pick it up, by what handle, by what direction, to [[eros]], to this whole notion of [[clinging]], as we explained, that actually are we picking it up as a key or are we picking it up as just something to reject just at one level? It certainly applies to imagination and [[Image|images]] in the conventional sense, two handles. Certainly also [[emptiness]], and the [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] tradition makes this very clear. To grasp at emptiness in the wrong way is like [[Craving|grasping]] at a snake by the tail, the wrong end - its head is just going to come and bite you, with regard to emptiness. I think it was Nāgārjuna who wrote that. ^1-1
###### 1-2
All things have two handles. And also [[delineations]] - so how we relate to the very process of generating and making delineations, either in [[perception]] or in conception or both. So it applies to all this. Now, what that little aphorism - I think it is not just saying you can pick things up but do not [[Clinging|cling]] to them or do not identify with them. Certainly that is part of it, how we pick something up. Maybe it would be more accurate to say, "All things have many handles." So there is many ways this admonition to care how, from what direction, in what way we pick something up applies to all the things we have been talking about so far. ^1-2
###### 1-3
With [[desire]] and with [[eros]], it is true at a certain level to say it is fire and one is playing with fire to play with these things, desire and eros. It is true, and there is heat there. But, you know, where would human beings be if certain experimentation with fire did not take place at some point? Yes, that asks for a lot. In other words, we need to take care. We need to have certain, perhaps, things in place - qualities, abilities in place. We have talked about this before. But yeah, in a way, we could say we are playing with fire to a certain extent. That does not always mean that the fire is raging; it is not always that it is super intense. To be intense, the eros is very intense, the desire is very intense, the fire is very intense - first of all, it wo not always be that way for anyone, and secondly, intense is neither better nor worse. So from one sort of standard perspective, intense desire - too simplistic - is a bad thing. From another perspective, again too simplistic, it is a good thing; it is better for it to be more intense, more fire. ^1-3
###### 1-4
But what this asks, this investigation into this, this exploration of this whole subject asks for a lot of sensitivity, the development of our sensitivity. I have touched on this in earlier teachings. It asks for a lot of subtlety in our [[attention]], and subtlety of [[Insight|discernment]], a very kind of keen, well-developed, sharp [[mindfulness]], if you like; a very sensitive mindfulness, sometimes a very soft, delicate mindfulness. It asks for a certain adventurousness of spirit, we could say, to go down this avenue and see what happens and explore. It asks for a certain boldness, a certain [[freedom]], we could say; freedom to question, boldness to question, to question boldly, and to experiment, to dare to experiment and find out. How will I find out? I have to experiment. If those things are in place, or we can bring them with us, or we can develop them as we go, all of that, then this exploration, I would say, can open up for us radical possibilities, radical openings, radical shifts in our understanding, our senses - as I said before, our sense of [[the self]], of other, of [[soul]], of imagination, of world, of [[Cosmology|cosmos]], of existence. Real revolutions are possible here for us. ^1-4
###### 1-5
So the potential with an exploration of [[eros]] is huge, huge and profound, wide and profound. ^1-5
###### 1-6
And we are talking about something that, if you like, is a formidable force. That does not always mean it is intense. Sometimes Cupid - that is the name, as you probably know, the Latin, the Roman name for the god [[Eros]] - some sort of artistic or statuesque depictions of Cupid are of this little sort of podgy little cherubic baby [[Daimon|angel]] with sort of soft, rolling, pinkish, smooth flesh, and maybe he is slightly mischievous with his bow and arrow and who he is going to shoot and kind of do the matchmaking thing. That is kind of all a little bit cutesy. Compare that, for example, with Plato's description - actually the words are put into the mouth of Diotima, who was a kind of mysterious seeress and philosopher, and her characterization of Eros. I got this from a philosopher called Gerald Bruns, and a literary critic. Diotima characterizes Eros as a hermeneutical daimon. Okay, what does that mean? [[Hermeneutics#Overview|Hermeneutics]] is interpretations, so his business is the interpretation of all things, all things. Eros has something to do with the way we see them and open up and see them as messages, as angels. Daimon is, you could say, another word for a demi-god or an angel or something like that - something given more than a purely personal or purely reductive existence and significance. ^1-6
###### 2-1
So "[[Eros]] is a hermeneutical [[daimon]] who shuttles back and forth between gods and men," gods and humanity, human beings, "between being and nothingness, between what is real and less real, between [[Insight|wisdom]] and [[ignorance]]." This Eros "looks just like Socrates, which is to say shoeless, ugly, impoverished, cunning in pursuit of the beautiful and the good, a lover of wisdom, and a master of jugglery, witchcraft and artful speech." I do not know if you can - I hope, if that is not kind of evident to you now, just how powerful and well-captured that description is, how much it points to, the kind of accuracy and what it brings in to involve there. A hermeneutical daimon shuffling back and forth between the divine and the human, between what is real and what is less real, between wisdom and ignorance, shoeless himself, ugly, always poor. Himself has nothing. Do you get this, even in terms of what we have described so far about eros itself has nothing? Cunning in pursuit of the beautiful and the good, yes? A lover of wisdom, of insight, and a master of jugglery, witchcraft and artful speech. So his mastery, his realm, his art, is the realm of art. It is not the realm of realist truth in the way that we tend to think about it. There is a lot in that. Very beautiful, and certainly not a little cutesy description there. We are really talking about something bigger than us, because divine. ^2-1
###### 2-2
[10:20] Now, we said already, we gave a kind of small start of a definition, if you like, of what [[eros]] is. But we also said when we talk about this [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]], or rather what instigates, inflames, invokes, elicits, puts in motion because of its wanting more in terms of the ways it expands, enriches, deepens, widens, complexifies, gives dimension to the [[Image|images]] that it beholds of its erotic object, its erotic object as image, in [[imaginal]] [[Dimensionality|dimensions]], and the ideas, the logoi, the concept of that erotic object - because of all that, the definition that we gave earlier, this wanting more contact, connection, intimacy, knowing, to know more, wanting more penetration, to penetrate more, to [[experience]] more, et cetera, all that, that provisional definition is exactly that, just provisional. ^2-2
###### 2-3
So we can almost make a kind of axiomatic statement, a kind of fundamental statement that because [[eros]] is not separate from this whole [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]] and what that does in its expansion, I am going to say we can never totally understand eros. There will always be something of it, something of eros beyond our grasp, beyond the grasp of our [[Insight|understanding]], and therefore, also maybe something of it to which we are always subject. Because it is more than we can get a full handle on, get our hands around, there may be something of eros to which we are always subject. We never feel like we have got it under our thumb. We never - it is always, in some sense, bigger than us, bigger than our minds, bigger than our capacities, in some sense. Now, this, of course, goes back to that whole origin, if you like, of the whole idea of Eros as a [[divinity]], which is something Jung restated, which implies the impossibility of a full definition, of capturing it conceptually. ^2-3
###### 2-4
But also we can see, if we think about the implications of this whole idea that [[eros]] opens up and inseminates and fertilizes [[psyche]] and [[logos]], which then further inflame and inseminate the eros, we can see that eros kind of has this tendency, because of the pothos in it, to keep expanding everything or shattering boundaries or stretching boundaries. Whether that is an [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]], or a lover, the way I see him/her, whatever it is, whether it is a piece of art, or a piece of [[music]], or an artist, or whatever it is, that is my imaginal perceptual object, and eros will tend to expand, will want to, will naturally expand, open, deepen, complexify, et cetera, everything - the object and everything it is in relation to. But also because eros itself is tied up in the larger definition with the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]], it means that eros itself also gets expanded. ^2-4
###### 3-1
This happens in two ways. It happens, as I said, because when the [[imaginal]] object becomes even richer, even deeper in its [[Dimensionality|dimensions]], even more wonderful, like a jewel revealing more and more sparkling facets and unknown [[Wonder|wonders]] and mysteries, and becomes more rich, more deep, more wide, then there is more [[eros]]. There is more eros, more to penetrate. I [[desire]], the eros desires, to penetrate to what I am now discovering, and desires to open to what it is now discovering of the erotic imaginal other. I see more there. He/she is more. I want to open to, I want to penetrate that. Eros wants to. So the eros itself swells. There is a tumescence, there is an increase, there is an empowerment. The degree of the fire, if you like, grows; the amount, the range, et cetera, of the eros. But in a second, way, too, because in all this, the [[image]] and the idea - the [[psyche]] and the [[logos]] of the eros; in other words, what is the image that is present of the very eros that is involved in this whole movement? ^3-1
###### 3-2
So certainly there is an [[image]] of the other and the [[imaginal]] other, and that is getting richer and wider, but then this spreads. We are going to go into this in more detail and all its implications. It spreads to self-reflect in this kind of autoeroticism - I will say more about that in talks to come - so that the very way that [[eros]] is regarded, the very image of eros and the very idea, the [[logos]] of the eros in the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]], not just to the object but also the eros, those boundaries, too, start to stretch or start to shatter and then have to reform in a wider, deeper, more [[Spaciousness|spacious]] and generous and multidimensional way. So whatever ideas and images are involved with the eros, the [[psyche]] and the logos of the eros, so to speak, those, too, are expanded. Do you understand? So eros, whatever our notion, whatever our image or [[fantasy]] of eros is, that, too, keeps growing, gaining new [[Dimensionality|dimensions]], just by virtue of what eros does and is and the whole eros-psyche-logos dynamic. ^3-2
###### 3-3
The [[eros]], too, as I said, starts to take on new [[Dimensionality|dimensions]], other facets of the eros itself, other resonances, other breadths that it encompasses, et cetera, and reveals, or that we discover in eros itself. Now, this does not mean, this does not imply - the fact that we can never totally understand it because of all of what I just said, we can never totally understand eros - that we should not explore it, that we should say, "Ah, okay, well, there is no point exploring it, or no point even trying to create ideas and concepts that address it, that support our exploration." It does not imply that we should stop trying for our exploration and inquires to go further, to go deeper, to go wider into the breadth of eros. Actually, to me, it should inspire a greater inquiry and exploration. Wherever we are in our [[Insight|understanding]] of eros, or wherever we are if we are building a concept or [[conceptual framework]] of eros and adding to it, wherever we are in that process, there is more. There is more to discover. There is more to add here. There is more to find out. There is [[Beauty|beauties]] and [[Wonder|wonders]] and depths and dimensions to be revealed. So it should inspire, rather than feeling frustrated because it is like, "I do not really get this yet," or "I have not sussed out, I have not encapsulated it, I have not figured it out." Even as I alluded to before, it could, hopefully, even give us a sense of [[Pleasantness|okayness]] and perhaps even rightness, those times when we feel driven or dragged by eros, and the eros seems as if it is bigger than us or bigger than what we can figure out or encapsulate in concepts or even in an [[image]]. There we recognize that not only is that okay, there is maybe even a profound rightness in that. ^3-3
###### 3-4
[19:18] So I do not know. Maybe you have been listening so far to the talks here, and maybe - I can say this for myself - leaning a little bit into trying to be a bit more precise and a bit more analytical about delineating between different concepts and qualities that we recognize when [[eros]] is present, and how we [[Delineations|delineate]] it from this and that, and… and maybe some of you are listening and actually, perhaps, starting to feel a little uneasy at times, because maybe feeling as if we are being too precise and too analytical. I have felt that at times just in the material that we have covered so far on this [[retreat]]. I am not sure. Is the precision and analysis that we are bringing to bear, at times is it, when is it, overstepping its [[soulmaking]] function, gone beyond its function, its support of soulmaking? When does precision and analysis, in this case - because what we are interested in is soulmaking. That is what we are interested in. When has actually the way that we are delineating things and with precision and making some analysis of how things relate and processes, et cetera, when does that overstep its soulmaking function? It is not an easy question. ^3-4
###### 4-1
On the one hand, you have got this notion that [[eros]] is divine, and the fact that because of the eros- [[psyche]]-[[logos]] dynamic, the kind of tendency of stimulating, inflaming, expanding, inseminating, fertilizing tendency of eros that it gives to eros, psyche, and logos, and more as we will explain in later talks, because of the [[divinity]] and because of that [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]] there is always going to be something mysterious retained about eros, something unfathomable, some sense of more - more that I have not quite discovered, more to it, more [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] to it. So on the one hand, all of that - this [[unfathomability]], if you like. And, at the same time, on the other hand, a certain amount of delineating, of defining, of highlighting of features, actually serves the movement of eros and the [[soulmaking]] process. So right here in relation to [[delineations]] and definitions, we have a dilemma. We have actually several dilemmas, but that is one of them. ^4-1
###### 4-2
There is, on the one hand, in approaching [[soulmaking]], in approaching things like [[eros]], oftentimes what is more helpful - and I have talked about this before and leaned that way at different times in both teachings and writings - is leaning more towards the poetic and the mythical sense, a poetic [[Insight|understanding]], poetic depiction, poetic presentation or unfolding that calls on the poetics of our understanding, and a more poetic understanding, a more poetic diction, a more mythical sensibility in exploring and receiving, in digesting, et cetera. And when to emphasize that, how much to emphasize that, relative to a more analytical. I do not know, so far on this [[retreat]], it seems to me that we have been leaning more towards the analytical. In the past and in other stuff I am working on right now, more the other way. Both. So there is a kind of dilemma here, balance. I do not know, different people, different times, same person. But that is something to bear in mind about all this, about making [[delineations]] here. ^4-2
###### 4-3
Actually, I want to say something general, make some general observations, say some general things about making [[delineations]] in general. In fact, I want to add to that and also say some general things about saying general things, if you follow me. So general observations about making delineations, and general things about saying general things. Now, I am aware, some of you might be like, "What? This is really abstract now." And it might - I do not know, if you are listening, whether this just sounds like really not relevant, or pretty vague, or just kind of abstract, or just like "hrrm." Maybe in time, maybe in time, hopefully, it will come to seem more relevant, why I am sort of saying these things now generally about making delineations and about different levels of [[insight]]. I hope that it does make sense at some point and seem both very relevant and quite important. ^4-3
###### 4-4
It is interesting, just in terms of sort of [[Insight|insights]] that can sound more abstract, or that are more general, that apply more generally, or that operate at a kind of higher meta-level, is that they can sound kind of vague - so much so that we barely hear them or they make very little impression. For many people, it is like they do not really recognize the value when they hear or read something at that level, or they sort of get it, but not really. They do not really get the way sometimes these sort of meta-level insights can have, because of their generality, have this really pervasive power. They are general, but they generate an enormous amount of other insights. They link things together, make certain ways of proceeding open, certain whole avenues - not just a little nook and a crack here, but whole avenues. They generate a lot through their generality and their pervasiveness, and their sort of all-pervading applicability, and then their implications. ^4-4
###### 4-5
So oftentimes, you know, I might teach or something, and many people remember a story that I told, or a certain [[image]] recounted. It strikes, it stays in the memory, makes an impression immediately. This is very, I think, probably normal for the ways that most people tend to understand as human beings, take in information, written or listening, or when the advice or the [[insight]] seems very, very specific, when it is obviously relevant to a situation that I find myself in immediately. But actually there often is much greater power, as I said, much more far-reaching sort of embrace and influence and implication in a more general meta-level of insight, oftentimes. ^4-5
###### 4-6
So it seems also that it is quite rare, I think - it is a rare person who actually kind of has an ability to recognize a sort of relative hierarchy of significance of ideas or [[Insight|insights]]. Sometimes it is almost the opposite; it is as if the more significant ones and the ones that are really radical (radical is from the word radix, meaning root), they really go to the root of things in their generality, in their power, in their implications, people have a hard time sort of recognizing what is a more radical, far-reaching, pervasive sort of meta-level insight and something that is much smaller, just because it seems immediately tangible and immediately obvious, immediately applicable to something that is right in front of me now in a very obvious way. So that is just the way most people's minds work. But in a way there is an encouragement there to try and reflect on this material, especially when it might seem a bit conceptual or that kind of level, in a way that starts to build something for you that is really helpful and will be really powerful and, as I said, radical and far-reaching in its implications. ^4-6
###### 5-1
[28:57] Because one of the things I wanted to say about [[delineations]] and making delineations is that, again, most - certainly not all, but a lot of people - appreciate clarity when they are reading something or hearing teachings or whatever. And it can seem, very easily, that something has been made clear to us if we are presented with, if we read or if we hear, kind of neat, well-delineated distinctions between things, between concepts, between qualities or factors of mind. Sometimes people say to me, "You are really clear and da-da-da... " So that is something that, you know, I do definitely try and do sometimes. I am certainly not wanting to throw that out. This is where the dilemmas come in. I do not want to throw that out, and I am certainly not advocating a kind of general sloppiness or inattention, and certainly not confusion. That is often not that helpful. ^5-1
###### 5-2
But I would say, or just kind of point out, that I think we should start to feel a little bit suspicious if the neat [[Delineations|distinctions]] that we have made ourselves or that we have been presented with by a teacher or by a piece of writing or whatever it is - we should feel suspicious, our suspicion should be aroused, if those neat distinctions seem to be being regarded by anyone - whoever is presenting them or ourselves listening - as real. We should be suspicious if these distinctions are presented as delineating real things, as accurately and simply reflecting the reality of things. If we sense that a person is or we ourselves are kind of slipping into that very common assumption and position, then I think our suspicion should be aroused. If we suspect that someone or we ourselves are [[clinging]] to these distinctions or these things that are delineated through distinctions and definitions, if we suspect they are being clung to as real - remember, that is a form of [[Ignorance|avijjā]]; that is ignorance at the deepest level - if they are clung to as real or as reflecting simply, accurately, the reality of things, we should be suspicious. ^5-2
###### 5-3
In the [[Dharma|Buddhadharma]], especially in the [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]], this is made really, really clear: those links of [[dependent origination]], they are not real. All Dharma concepts, they are just [[ways of looking]]. They are just ways of dividing things. They do not reflect reality. They are ways of looking, ways of delineating, in the service of something. So I would say, along with the [[Buddha]] - why did he say after his [[Awakening|enlightenment]], "It is hard to understand, this dependent origination that I have discovered. Hard to understand, subtle, profound, only the wise can see it," et cetera? Very famous quote. "I am not sure whether I want to even try teaching this." There is a whole structure of concepts that he is not saying, "This is reality," he is saying, "Look this way and you will understand something about reality." Eventually - I think I have said this already on this [[retreat]] - the very [[insight]] that is generated by the structure of the [[delineations]] of dependent origination, those links, et cetera, if we approach it the right way, melts those very delineations and distinctions, melts the very links so that the whole thing is like a snake eating its own tail, swallowing its own tail; the whole thing dissolves. ^5-3
###### 5-4
So the question is how to move. I do not just shrug and say, "Ah, yeah, no concepts." If I just shrug and say all concepts are false, I am just left with my default concepts. I have not gone anywhere. All I have done is probably reinforced a little bit of laziness and sloppiness. How do I actually get from [[delineations]] through those delineations into a much more profound realization, much more profound [[freedom]], and even beyond those delineations? So that is definitely there in [[Dharma|Dharma teachings]]. The question is, exactly how can I approach these teachings in ways that do that? That is where I go back to the idea of [[ways of looking]], [[fabrication]], et cetera. For me, that is a very powerful way. ^5-4
###### 6-1
But that [[insight]] about the suspicion of neat [[Delineations|distinctions]] is there in Western philosophy as well, even back to Plato. He used to make fun of certain characters who were so fond of making these distinctions very clear, very neat, and they would get kind of ridiculed a little bit in his dialogues. Hegel, as well, another one who gets a lot of stick, but actually partly his extraordinary insight was that any belief in clear concepts, as if they reflect reality, just does not stand scrutiny. As you look at it, bring more investigation to bear, you see it involves its opposite, it does not hold, the boundaries fracture, et cetera. We can see this in our own practice just as the [[mindfulness]] gets keener, more subtle, sharper, more sensitive. As our investigation gets deeper, more directed, more cunning, if you like, and as our insight grows, we will witness this, too, in our very own [[experience]]. ^6-1
###### 6-2
So just for example, at first the vedanā (the pleasant, unpleasant, or what some people call neutral - neither pleasant nor unpleasant), the three categories of vedanā, and the distinction between vedanā, say, and [[craving]] - here is this [[Pleasantness|pleasant feeling]], and then there is the craving to get more of it or to move towards it or to hang onto it or whatever, or here is this unpleasant, and the craving to [[Aversion|push it away]], to get rid of it, to reduce it, whatever. It seems like the vedanā and the craving are two different things. It is very important to [[Delineations|delineate]] two different things and actually see in our [[experience]], "Yes, here is two different things. I can see A and I can see B." I then see their relationship. ^6-2
###### 6-3
As I go deeper in [[insight]], that very distinction starts to blur, and we start to see it is a kind of illusory distinction. No vedanā, no [[craving]]; no craving, no vedanā. Craving and vedanā are inseparable, as are craving and [[clinging]] - we touched on that before - and as are [[Ignorance|avijjā]] and saṅkhāra at a very deep level, as are, in fact, all of the [[Skandhas|five aggregates]], also the mental aggregates. [[Perception]] and [[consciousness]], they are not two separate things. They are divided up in terms of the aggregates, the third and the fifth aggregate. They are not separate. Perception and vedanā are not separate. Perception, vedanā, and consciousness are not separate. The aggregates are not referring to separate or separable things. They are not real, distinct entities. The [[delineations]] are made to serve a certain purpose, but they are not reflective of reality. We can see that in any domain, and certainly with [[Dharma]] concepts. So that is another dilemma regarding making delineations, in terms of clarity and the illusions of clarity or the seduction of what seems like clarity. ^6-3
###### 6-4
There is another potential pitfall or danger, making [[delineations]]. As I mentioned earlier, when we delineate something like [[eros]] from [[desire]] or [[craving]] or whatever it is, in doing that, we amplify something. We amplify a thing through a distinction, distinguishing it from other things. So we are delineating a theme, or an area, or a quality, or whatever. In a way, we are creating it - in a way. We are discovering it and we are creating it. We will come back to this [[Create-Discover|create/discover]] sort of amalgam or [[Nondualism|duality]] later. But in a way, we are actually creating something for our [[experience]] and reflection. And then we have got this thing called eros. In relation to that area of experience or that theme of eros, it is possible that it becomes an area where we then pass judgment on ourselves. So here I have created this thing, we have created this thing, whatever it is. We create something called [[Samadhi|samādhi]], and then lo and behold, we start measuring where we are in relationship to our samādhi, or our [[insight]], or [[Awakening|liberation]], or eros, or whatever it is. ^6-4
###### 6-5
In a way, I think - I am not sure if he actually said this, but in a way, it comes out of some of the [[Insight|insights]] of Michel Foucault, in regard, let us say, to [[sexuality]], in fact. He pointed out in his sort of archeology of the [[history]] of the whole sense and idea of sexuality that you can trace it back and, in a way, how much more defined and complex and solidified and prominent it is as a concept now, to which the [[The Self|sense of self]] then relates itself or attaches itself. In other words, over the past several hundred years, two things have grown, and they have grown together: one is the sense of sexuality, or sexuality as a sort of theme of human psychology, of human behavior, of [[Personhood|human being]], and with that - not just dependent on that, but with that - also the whole idea of individuality, self, and identity, which as I mentioned before is a lot different now in the kinds of [[Centre|interiority]] and the prominence of individuality than it was, let us say, several hundred years ago in Europe. ^6-5
###### 6-6
So [[sexuality]] becomes this thing and this area where my identity and the measurement of my identity is so often wrapped up - oftentimes in not a very simple way, and also quite a painful way because of judgmentalism and actually a lot of [[ignorance]] and not knowing. My identity is wrapped up with sexuality, and sexuality is wrapped up with my identity and individuality, and what is my sexual expression, and how am I presenting myself sexually, and how am I in bed, and da-da-da-da-da. So there is a lot of potential and [[beauty]] that comes out of that, and there is a kind of danger there. As I said, we bring forth [[eros]], or we create eros, if you like, as a theme, we amplify it as a theme, and then with that, if we explore, then we have a ton of questions in our exploration like I threw out - how then do we keep eros alive, which is different than [[Metta|mettā]]? How do we keep eros alive in a long-term relationship? But we need to be careful with all this because, as I said, we might be creating another area in which to judge ourselves. So, "I have failed. I am an erotic failure." [laughs] Or, "My relationship is a failure in terms of its eros." "I should be this or that." "It should be this or that." "There is something wrong with me." "Is there something wrong with me?" "Everyone else, I bet, is... " whatever. ^6-6
###### 7-1
[42:26] You can see it, again, you can see it with [[Samadhi|samādhi]], that most people - actually nowadays it is more of an issue because there is a kind of hype about [[attention]] and performance at work and productivity, so people really are into developing their cognitive functioning with different apps and all that sort of stuff. But, you know, generally speaking, unless someone's really been exposed to a kind of teaching or [[retreat]] or situation where people are just really talking about being [[Mindfulness|mindful]], and being present, and not being distracted, and coming back, and staying steady, and vitakka and vicāra, then people really start to measure where they are with their samādhi and it becomes this thing that otherwise they would not even have given a second thought to, would not have made it a big deal or a painful thing in their life. So similar with [[eros]]. The distinction opens up a beautiful avenue, and it can become then something we unfortunately measure ourselves with. So, dilemma here. A double-edged sword. But creating/discovering is part of different themes, different areas, different [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] of our being, of the being, of the other. This is a part of what the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]] does. We will come back to this. It does [[Create-Discover|create/discover]] more and more. It creates and discovers more and more dimensions, more and more little cracks that open into areas, like I was saying, getting your foot in the door and then it opens to a whole avenue, [[Delineations|distinctions]], delineations are made, othernesses are made, all this. So it is a double-edged sword. [[Beauty]], [[soulmaking]] there, but a dilemma, or many dilemmas. ^7-1

Sometimes people say pointing out the differences between different teachings, and also delineating concepts, creates dualities, creates otherness or othernesses. Pointing out the differences between different teachings, and delineating concepts, creates dualities and creates otherness. Now, that is true. And sometimes that even creates - let us say this: it is true, but it is not always bad. Just the creation of [[Nondualism|duality]] in itself, or differentiations, or othernesses, is not necessarily always a bad thing that leads to [[dukkha]]. Again, careful of being too simple here. And, you know, even the different sort of schisms among, let us say, psychoanalytic schools or psychotherapeutic schools, you know, you could say that is terrible, and all the difficulty and the interpersonal difficulty and this and that that comes out of it. On the other hand, look at the richness that came out of it. Look at the creativity that comes with a schism. So it is not only that it just simply leads to dukkha. ^7-2

Even in [[Meditation|Dharma practice]] you can see, going back to this idea of [[ways of looking]], [[Delineations|delineate]] between different ways of looking, really subtly different ways of looking, and you see - delineating between two ways of looking, whatever they are - one [[Fabrication|fabricates]] more [[dukkha]] and more [[perception]], and one fabricates less. That brings me an [[insight]], and it brings me more [[freedom]], but it comes out of delineation. [[Nondualism|Duality]] is not a problem there; it is actually something that really can be profoundly helpful, profoundly fruitful. If I make a delineation and then it brings some ease and some freedom and less fabrication, actually there is the possibility there of then making even more refined delineations, even subtler delineations between concepts, et cetera, and degrees of [[clinging]], et cetera, and getting even less fabricating - fabricating even less dukkha, fabricating even less perception, and the level of insight that can come out of that. We have explained this before. So it is not just, "Oh, yeah, I find a way of being or a way of looking that kind of feels pretty groovy and pretty relaxed, and clearly there is not much suffering there, and then I just kind of kick back and relax, and without too much [[Contraction|tightness]] surf in and out of that." Great, but limited, okay? ^7-3

The creation, if you like, or the creation/discovery of dualities, polarities, othernesses, is intrinsic to the erotic process, the process of [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos]], intrinsic to the soulmaking dynamic. We are going to explain more about this later because it is quite important. Wrapped up in that is also complexity. When the eros-psyche-logos dynamic gets going, the [[imaginal]] object, the erotically charged other, the erotic beloved, gets complexified, complicated, in a a good way. They are like a jewel - you suddenly see, oh, look at that, it is got even finer facets, et cetera, and the way it reflect the light in the different ways off the different facets. Its [[beauty]] is increased through its [[Papanca|complication]], its depth, that there is more to discover there. So complexity also - not always, but also - is generally speaking, or rather on the whole, generated, created and discovered, through the [[soulmaking]] process. So again, I caution against this sort of addiction to simplicity, this simplistic addiction to simplicity, what I call simplism. ^8-1
###### 8-2
So the question is when to be simple, and when not to be simple. Or, actually, even more accurately, in this situation, what will a simple perspective give me, and what will a not-so-simple perspective give me? In this situation, what will a simple perspective give me, and what will a not-so-simple perspective give me? Where will it take me if I look in a way that simplifies, and if I look in a way that actually seems like it is not so simple? And on the other hand, sometimes as human beings we are listening to teachings or reading something, and either we do it or someone is kind of offering something to us, some distinction or other, and it actually does not serve anything at all. So what is the point of that distinction? It does not free you in any way. It does not bring any more freeing [[insight]]. It does not open [[soulmaking]]. It is just a kind of pedantry. So again, there is a kind of insight in really, again, delineating what [[delineations]] are actually worth making. What are the particular results of making certain delineations? Which ones are just like, what is the point of making them? It really does not serve. They may sound clever or whatever, and it is just a pedantry. So this is what I mean by a meta-level of insight. So actually learning how to look, how to create distinctions, when to pull back, what kind of distinctions, where each of them will take me, daring to find out and toss out the ones that are not helpful, and pursue the ones that, even though they seem quite tricky, I can sense there is richness here, there is treasure to be discovered of different kinds. ^8-2
###### 8-3
[51:04] For our purposes now on this [[retreat]], primarily, it is like, which [[Delineations|distinctions]] bring [[soulmaking]]? When does a certain delineation increase, serve, support and [[Cultivation|nourish]] the soulmaking? For example, as we said, just the distinction between [[eros]] and greed is, to my mind - and I hope you will see - a distinction that helps soulmaking. I do not just tip out eros because it is a kind of [[desire]], and desire, I have heard, is a bad thing and I am trying to live without it, live without [[clinging]], et cetera. We talked about that. But even the distinction, say, between [[Happiness|joy]] and happiness. I would define them slightly differently sometimes to actually open up a difference there. Joy, I would say, is a kind of happiness that is richer and deeper, if you like, in different ways. I will go into that another time. ^8-3
###### 8-4
Someone told me - this is secondhand, so I am not sure if it is true, but I have heard it - that in the Tibetan language there is only two words for [[emotions]]: happy and sad. I am still not sure whether I quite believe it, but apparently there is just two words. Unlike English, it is a very, very simple language. There is two words for emotions, so you are either happy or you are sad. I am guessing there is a word for [[equanimity]], because that is a Buddhist word, but anyway. Happy and sad. Someone was telling me that they knew a Tibetan who then moved to the West and learned English. They were reporting after some years experiencing emotions, after they learned English, that they never knew that they had before. Is it that? That the language is highlighting something that was there anyway? Or is it that the language is actually creating new emotions, the very delineation creates something? Or both? I'd say it is both, myself. ^8-4
###### 8-5
So this is interesting in its relevance to [[soulmaking]] and to [[fabrication]]. We can very easily believe or be taught that words are thoughts, and thoughts bring discriminations, and discriminations have to do with papañca, they create papañca, so do not get entangled in words because they feed thoughts, which feed discrimination, which feeds papañca. There is a way that is true in the original meaning of - well, actually, there is a way that is sometimes true, if papañca and fabrication are equated, that [[delineations]] create fabrication sometimes. But it is also, as I said, that the word - say the different words for different [[emotions]], subtle shades of emotion, the kinds of emotion - that actually the words serve to create delineations in our sensitivity, and refinements of our sensitivity, and this actually stimulates fabrication, a diversity of fabrication then. In the way a lot of psychoanalysts use the term [[consciousness]], this then stimulates consciousness. We are then conscious of some arena more because we have been given a delineation that opens it up. And some of that increase in consciousness can be soulmaking. So the fabrication there can be, some of it, in the service - it is possible it can be in the service of soulmaking. New doors, new experiences, new [[Insight|understandings]] can be opened through making verbal delineations. ^8-5
###### 9-1
So again, the simplistic spiritual teaching about "get away from words" and "do not think" or "do not get attached," it is appropriate sometimes, and like so many things, sometimes the very opposite is true - there will be more [[soulmaking]], more of the [[Soulmaking Dynamic|eros-psyche-logos dynamic]] will be stimulated, through the [[delineations]] of words, through the magic of words. Sometimes there is that possibility. So regarding delineations, [[fabrication]], and soulmaking, what can we say? Well, some delineations actually decrease fabrication. They support certain [[ways of looking]] which will actually fabricate way less than we could have without that delineation. Some delineations will actually increase fabrication, and actually create problems, or create subtleties of [[awareness]], or whatever. The soulmaking could be in the greater fabrication, as we will point out more and more on the [[retreat]]. Sometimes more fabrication means more soulmaking, or skillful fabrication is soulmaking. And sometimes there is an element of the [[soul]], we could say, or a dimension of the soul, that the decrease of fabrication, the movement towards the [[Unfabricated]] and that spectrum there, is also soulmaking in a different way. So the relationship there - there is all the different permutations and possibilities in terms of making delineations, increase or decrease of fabrication, and serving or not serving soulmaking. It is not that simple, and it invites our investigation and our careful [[attention]], and our intelligence. ^9-1

Okay. Last thing. Why am I saying all this? [laughs] You might be wondering. Why am I saying all this? Well, because it will guide our work. A lot of this will guide our work, certain material that we are exploring together in this course. Certainly your practice, especially as it develops, you know, some of this will really guide that work and your thinking, and your thinking about these things, and your thinking about practice and how you approach practice. I am saying some of it, also, really as a kind of - apologetic is the wrong word, but justification for what is being presented here and for this whole structure and integrated path and the introduction of new concepts, et cetera, that seem kind of unusual or really counter to what we might have heard before. So it is partly, yeah, I admit, it is a kind of feeling it might be important for some people to have that justification, to have it make sense. ^9-2
###### 9-3
But there is another reason I am saying all this. In a way I am saying it for - let us say for the future. What we are presenting here, and what we are going into here, and what we are kind of elaborating and building, if you like, and playing with, playing with building, in terms of concepts and practices and refinements of [[attention]] and all that, it is not a closed system. It might be integrated, and maybe it seems that way, but my hope is it is really not. I am not talking about a closed system. My hope, or the invitation, really, is that as time goes on in the future, or very soon, or whenever, that you or some of you will feel like you want to or are called upon to add, to build, to what we are talking about here, and what we are sharing together here, and exploring, and experimenting with and presenting. So I am saying this for the service of opening an avenue that no one owns, that other people can add to and build tributaries and other avenues that connect up, or make more lanes in the highway, or whatever the analogy would be, or a building that then is added to and given a whole extension or whatever it is. ^9-3
###### 9-4
I am saying it for the sake of creativity. Because there is a whole other way - and I am going to come back to this - there is a whole other way, a whole other dimension of practice, which has to do with the creativity of one's practice, or the creativity of even making one's own practice, making one's own path, making one's own [[Dharma]], creating/discovering one's own Dharma - the [[eros]] and the [[soulmaking]] of the creativity of Dharma, or Dharma as creativity. In other words, it is open. Do you understand what I am saying? I know that sounds maybe like a big deal, and not everyone will feel called to that or attracted to it. But I am saying this for the sake of an open, shared, creative project, so that if the time comes and you or indirectly someone wants to make further [[delineations]], wants to make further definitions, wants to add to something, wants to question something, pull something apart, give it another level, et cetera, that all this generalities I have said about definitions and delineations and the dilemmas involved, all that applies to doing that - the erotics of an open, endless, creative path, an open, endless conception, and what is it to be wise, and creative, and insightful, and playful, and artistic - I am not sure if those are the right words - in one's relationship to that. This is something we will come back to, in terms of the relationship with the path in general, other [[Dimensionality|dimensions]]. But hopefully that makes a little bit of sense. Maybe it will make the sense that it needs to in the places that it needs to. ^9-4
