# The Garden of the Soul: Rob Burbea's Teachings
<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
If the <i>samādhi</i> feels strong enough or there's a sense of settledness in the mind and the heart with the compassion, it can be almost, at times, as if the body has <i>turned into</i> compassion. And you just let yourself <i>be</i> compassion, and just radiate that out. Let everything become compassion.<br/>
<br/>
