**2021-09-27 @Shannon: Welcome!** Thank you for the time you spend here! ...  please feel free to get in touch, whenever! (frank.schuhardt@gmail.com).

## AirTable of the Rob Burbea Transcription Project
You find **all transcribed talks of Rob Burbea** in an easy-to-use [**Airtable**](https://airtable.com/shr9OS6jqmWvWTG5g/tblHlCKWIIhZzEFMk/viw3k0IfSo0Dve9ZJ), provided by the _Rob Burbea Transcription Project_. This is an invaluable resource for everyone who wants to learn about Rob's teachings!

This Digital Garden presents only a small subset of what you'll find in the AirTable. Note that the AirTable links to the audio files and transcript PDFs, whereas the Digital Garden makes use of cross-referencing, has indexes, summaries, tables, charts, etc. It also has links to certain points in the audio files. You can see the Digital Garden as another way to present the talks, making use of the wonderful work of the _Rob Burbea Transcription Project_.

## Some first info on how to work with this Digitial Garden
For an **intro** into what this digital garden is about, you might want to take a look at the talk summaries in [[2020 Vajra Music]], which link to the paragraphs of the transcripts of talks in that series.
