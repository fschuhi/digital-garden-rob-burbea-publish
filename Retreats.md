# The Garden of the Soul: Rob Burbea's Teachings
<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
What if I saw everything as unsatisfactory? Just things come into consciousness, any experience, anything at all - just regard it as unsatisfactory. It's not a loathing or an aversion. Just saying, "Ah! It can't satisfy me." What happens is there's a letting go.<br/>
<br/>
