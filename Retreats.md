# The Garden of the Soul: Rob Burbea's Teachings
<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
So please don't be biased by <i>my</i> biases. If you don't agree with my bias, that's completely fine. What I really want to get to is the importance of questioning, not that I want to convince you of a certain bias I have within that range. The questioning is the important thing, okay?<br/>
<br/>
