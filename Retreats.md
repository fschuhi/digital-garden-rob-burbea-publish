# Garden of Soul: Rob Burbea's Teachings
<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
This right now, this sound, this sight, these body sensations, it's all in the context of .. the vast unknown of death. So in a way can we contemplate the infinite every day, can we contemplate death every day. Not morbid. Maybe a little scary at first but actually moving towards equanimity, moving towards freedom.<br/>
<br/>
