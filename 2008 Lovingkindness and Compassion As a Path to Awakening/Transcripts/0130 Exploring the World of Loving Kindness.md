###### 1-1
Tonight I'd like to talk about some of the aspects of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, some of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span> that we begin to uncover, begin to feel, when we explore, when we move into this practice<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > This talk is about the dimensions we uncover when practicing metta" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#This talk is about the dimensions we uncover when practicing metta" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1
###### 1-2
So, to reiterate something we've already said a few times: to remember that _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ can never just be a feeling. Sometimes we are just having that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a></span> in planting the seeds, seeds of intentionality, and how profound - very simple but profound that is, and powerful<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Metta can never just be a feeling" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Metta can never just be a feeling" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2
###### 1-3
But even when _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ _is_ felt as a feeling - and we have a _feeling_ of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> - even then, it's not just one feeling. And I sort of mentioned this in the morning instructions the other day. And you may have noticed this in your practice. In those moments, in those times when there is a feeling, there is something felt, in the heart, or in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, might _more_ accurately talk about a constellation of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span>. So sometimes the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ feels warm. It's felt as a warmth. Sometimes it's a kind of bubbly feeling. There's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> with it. Sometimes it's very soothing. Sometimes calming. Sometimes it's very bright, very luminous. Sometimes very gentle. And the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, the felt <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, can go through all those different textures, different colours, different flavours. It's actually important to feel that. And this is partly why we keep encouraging this sensitivity that's developed in your practice, particularly sensitivity to the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, and just actually _allowing_ the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ to take these subtly different flavours, at times. Sometimes, when it has that feeling, to go through that, and really just allowing that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Its more a constellation of feelings" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#It's more a constellation of feelings" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3
###### 1-4
And you may also have noticed, many of you may also have noticed by now, sometimes one's doing _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ to oneself, or _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ to the friend or the benefactor, and we are conscious of our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> or their <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ takes on the colour, the flavour, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> at that point. So, certainly, we need to discriminate between these two, between _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and be quite specific and precise about what is _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ and what is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. But they also overlap. And when the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, as many of you will have experienced already, when it touches <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, it has the flavour of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And just to allow that, just to allow that. It's part of the constellation of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span> that _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ is<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > We need to discriminate between metta and compassion" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#We need to discriminate between metta and compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4

Apologies tonight if I'm a little low <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> - I'm still struggling with an illness, and it seems to have got the better hand this evening, but ... ^1-5
###### 1-6
So, there's a constellation of possible <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span>. And we go through these categories. We're beginning to unfold these categories. And so, we have <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, the benefactor, the friend, etc. And it's important to recognize that these categories are not fixed. Someone is not _inherently_ a friend, or _inherently_ - later we'll do the difficult person, or neutral - that they're very fluid categories. So someone might be a benefactor or a friend, in that category, and then they say the wrong thing to us. [laughter] And you know, they get relegated a couple of divisions. [laughter] And hopefully, you heal that, and they get promoted again. [laughter] ^1-6
###### 1-7
But they're not - there is nothing fixed. The whole practice is very fluid. The reason for the categories - it's just a technique to gradually extend the range of the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ towards this boundlessness, which is the aspiration of the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_. So it's just a tool<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Having categories is a technique to extend the range of metta towards boundlessness" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Having categories is a technique to extend the range of metta towards boundlessness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-7
###### 2-1
And we start with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, and we've spent two days with that. This has already been said, but just to say it again: how common it is, actually, for that to be quite a difficult orientation for the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_. Difficult to direct the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ towards <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> - not for everyone, but it's really quite common. And there are all kinds of reasons for this. We can talk about childhood and family and school, and many, many possible reasons. And a lot of it, in fact, is just cultural. Sometimes, looking at the culture we're in at the moment, it's almost like there's a bit of a mixed message out there, about how one is in relationship to oneself. In many respects, perhaps looking at the culture, we can see that we're in a bit of a culture of selfishness: "me first." Maybe a few people around me, but "me first." And somehow with that, the message from the culture - and sometimes it's not even overt - the message is, "To <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> oneself, to cherish oneself in a healthy way, is somehow selfish." There's quite a confusing message, just that we're getting from the culture<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Due to our cultural background it can be difficult to orient metta towards the self" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Due to our cultural background it can be difficult to orient metta towards the self" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
But in a way, whatever the reasons (and it can be quite complex), we often, or many people find themselves in a situation where it's quite difficult to direct the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> towards themselves, the intention of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> towards themselves. Or even to have an idea or a belief, a view, that it's not a good idea, that it's selfish. And just to have that view<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > We might even have the view that it is selfish" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#We might even have the view that it is selfish" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
All of that - quite complex, the reasons for it, but _might_ be just a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span>, might have just become a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> of viewing, a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> of a way of relating to our self, or a way of not relating to our self. And as such, one of the functions of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice is just to weaken that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span>. Again, it's not a very glamorous <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> at the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, but it's extremely powerful: we're just weakening <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span> that are unhelpful<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Metta weakens the unhelpful habits of not relating to our self" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Metta weakens the unhelpful habits of not relating to our self" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
And it's so necessary, so necessary for our lives, for our path, for our practice, to be in the context of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> for oneself. That is the inner climate of the way we're moving through our life, and the way we're moving through our practice. So necessary. And just to repeat, actually, that quote from the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> again, so powerful : ^2-4
###### 2-5
You could search the entire universe for someone more deserving of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> than yourself, and you will not find that person. You will not find that being.^[A similar quote is attributed to the Buddha in Sharon Salzberg, _Lovingkindness: The Revolutionary Art of Happiness_ (Boston: Shambhala, 1995), 31. For the canonical passage, see Ud 5:1] ^2-5
###### 2-6
Something to really reflect on. It's not about what we think we deserve. It's not about what we think we've done, or how we think we measure up. What we haven't done, what we've said, what we didn't say, what goes through our minds, what we think of ourselves - we're saying all of that's actually irrelevant. Just the fact of your being means that you deserve it. And to give the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> to ourselves is actually a gift to others, begins to become a foundation from which we can give to others, and actually, an indispensable foundation for making that a steady and a deep giving that lasts<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > To give love to ourselves becomes a foundation from which we can give to others" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#To give love to ourselves becomes a foundation from which we can give to others" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-6
###### 2-7
So there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, and then there are the categories of the friend, and the benefactor, which we've done these days. Now, has anyone mentioned the word '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a></span>' yet? No? Okay, well people are smiling, so they've heard of it. But in this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, has anyone<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Near enemy" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Near enemy" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^2-7
###### 2-8
**Yogi**: It's referenced. ^2-8
###### 3-1
**Rob**: Well, okay. '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">Near enemy</a></span>' is a bit of a strange concept that comes from the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>, actually.^[The concept of a 'near enemy' of _mettā_ seems to originate from post-canonical Pali texts. See Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa, _The Path of Purification: Visuddhimagga_, tr. Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli (Onalaska, WA: Pariyatti, 1999), 311] And what it means is something that _looks_ like <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, _looks_ like <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, but isn't. It's pretty close, but it isn't. And the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a></span> of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, is _attached <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>_. Now, we all have experienced that. It's not unconditional <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. So _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ in its aspiration is: it doesn't matter what you do, what you give me back, what you say, whether you're grateful, what you've done, whether I like you - none of that. It's unconditional. But usually, there are strings and conditions attached to our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, and it's actually attached <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Near enemy of metta is attached love" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Near enemy of metta is attached love" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
This is very important, because what we find when we begin exploring for ourselves what _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ means, what we run into is a lot of this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a></span> stuff, a lot of attached <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. And the first thing to say is that's totally okay. It's totally normal and okay<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Attached love is totall normal and okay" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Attached love is totall normal and okay" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
We practise with the totality of our humanity. That's what we are, and that's what we bring to practice, and that's what we practise with. And as human beings, of course, well, we are human. We are complex. A lot of our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span> and intentions - there's quite a messiness there. And in a way, that messiness is the stuff of our humanity. And so it's important to enlarge the picture of the practice and just include all that. We're going to run into these <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Near enemy" data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemies</a></span>. No question about it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Messiness is the stuff of our humanity" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Messiness is the stuff of our humanity" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3
###### 3-4
And they're actually part of the practice. So not to see them as, "Oh, I give up," you know, or "Oh, I'm not doing it right." They're actually part of the practice, to encounter attached <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>, in the walking, as you go about the day, in your interactions with people. It's part of the practice, and actually a necessary part of the practice, because it's through that that we learn about what '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a></span>' is, but we also learn what pure _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ is. Without the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Near enemy" data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemies</a></span>, we could never make that journey of learning. So not to regard it as a kind of failure, or "I'm not getting it right." This is a learning process as much as anything else. And one's beginning to see the different aspects<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Through the near enemy we learn what pure metta is" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Through the near enemy we learn what pure metta is" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-4
###### 3-5
So today we introduced the friend, the category of the friend. And so to reflect a little bit - I mean, each of us, I think this is really important in our lives, to reflect: what does it mean to be a friend? What does it mean to be a good friend in this life? And actually, there are a lot of aspects just to that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > What does it mean to be a good friend in this life" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#What does it mean to be a good friend in this life" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-5
###### 3-6
Part of it is _seeing_ another. Do we _see_ our friend? Do we really _see_ them? <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jiddu Krishnamurti" data-href="Jiddu Krishnamurti" class="internal-link">Krishnamurti</a></span> used to talk about this a lot - how easy it is to just habituate oneself to another, especially when we're very familiar or very intimate with them. And we begin almost to not see them freshly. So I would say an aspiration of friendship, or what friendship means, is to have the aspiration to keep seeing another, to keep seeing them, to keep that fresh, open, not to put another in a box. This goes on all the time, in the best of our friendships. It goes on all the time. And it's just a matter of admitting that to ourselves. And again, what does it mean to be a good friend? It means to care about that, and to try and keep breaking that open, and having it be fresh. And that's quite a task. I think it's quite a task. And especially, you know, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span>, friendships, intimate <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span> that last years - how easy it is to just gloss over the other with time, with familiarity<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Friendship means to have the aspiration to keep seeing each other" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Friendship means to have the aspiration to keep seeing each other" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-6
###### 3-7
So that's part of what friendship means, that aspiration. But this is where our humanity comes in. Also, let's be realistic. If I'm friends with someone, perhaps until we are completely <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightened</a></span>, completely awakened, I'm also, as much as I want to see the other, I'm going to want to be seen. So that's already attached. You know, there are already some strings attached there. I would say, in the context of a friendship, that's okay. That's part of what it is<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Its ok that we also want to be seen by the other" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#It's ok that we also want to be seen by the other" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-7
###### 4-1
What we've got here is something quite human and complex, and not, perhaps, quite the stainless picture that we might at first see, that might at first seem the case when we come to _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice. We want to be seen, and it's a beautiful thing to feel like you are being seen by a friend. And perhaps that's a necessary part of our friendships, and a necessary part of our humanity. How does it feel in a friendship when we don't feel seen? We see the other, we try to see the other, we want to be seen, we need to be seen, and we also need to want to see ourselves. How am I in this relationship? I'm interacting - what's going on for me? What are my intentions? What are my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span>? So we see ourselves, too, and that's equally important. We talk about what is friendship, what makes good friendship<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > How am I in this relationship" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#How am I in this relationship" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-1
###### 4-2
We appreciate the other in a friendship. There is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a></span> for who they are, for how they are, for what they do, for their manifestation. And hopefully there is the willingness and the ability to express that. And this is something we all need to look into: do I hold back my voicing of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span> that I'm in? How easy it is to get into that pattern, and just a little bit inhibited in doing that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Do I hold back my voicing of appreciation" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Do I hold back my voicing of appreciation" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-2
###### 4-3
And conversely, again, we take in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a></span>. And again, this is a very interesting one. How many of us - is it actually quite difficult? We have someone who loves us, and they're expressing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a></span>, and some wall comes up over the heart, just can't take it in. It just bounces right off. How common this is. And again, to appreciate oneself - all this is part of what friendship is. Or rather, I would say, friendship is the commitment to growing in all of that, and to uncovering all of that, to discovering all of that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Am I walling off the appreciation coming from the other" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Am I walling off the appreciation coming from the other" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-3
###### 4-4
So I think it's fair to say there's a kind of level of practice, or a dimension of practice, that's really about reparenting ourselves. I mean, that's a way of putting it. Sometimes, for some people, literally, the parents did not provide enough of what was needed. And there is, in a way, a very real reparenting that goes on, very gradually, over months and years.

It somehow doesn't feel very human - _sometimes_, _some_ of the references. And there's a way that it can feel like it excludes or precludes our personality, our self-expression, our uniqueness. So this is really important: it _doesn't_.

It's very interesting. We have a sense of _me_, _my_ personality, _my_ individuality. The question, Dharmically, is not that that shouldn't be there, that we shouldn't have a sense of our individuality and our uniqueness. It's rather, is the way that I'm regarding my personality, my uniqueness, my individuality, is the way I'm holding that leading to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> for me and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> to others?

Actually, there are many other <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span> at it. One is that this - in this case [gesturing to self] - this particular individuality, this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">particular self</a></span>-expression, this particular uniqueness, is the result of an infinite web, completely inextricable <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">web of conditions</a></span>, in the present and reaching far back into the past. So just this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, genetically, from the parents and the whole sort of, you know, millennia, multi-millions, billions of years recess, actually, right back to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Big Bang" class="internal-link">Big Bang</a></span>. And the evolution of matter, and the genetic passing on - this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. And then this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> nourished by air, nourished by food, nourished by sunlight. This makes this particular expression of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, like it or not<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > My particular uniqueness is a result of an infinite web of conditions" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#My particular uniqueness is a result of an infinite web of conditions" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1

Personality, everything that I've read, all the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span> I've had, all the interactions, all the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> I've loved - all of that goes to make this particular unique expression right now, this moment right now. And there's a way that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> and the very individuality and uniqueness of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> is inextricably bound up with, actually, _everything else_ in the whole universe. We have a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span> of separateness. Can we practise - and this is a really important word, 'practise,' because we can kind of understand this intellectually - can we practise reversing that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span> and actually seeing another way, seeing in terms of this web? So part of what 'practise' means is playing with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span>, shaking things up, saying, "Let me look at this another way. Let me practise looking at this another way," until that other way, which brings <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> with it, which brings <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> with it, becomes much more accessible, much more normal for us<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > This individuality is bound up with everything else in the universe" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#This individuality is bound up with everything else in the universe" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2

This is really a question for us as practitioners: are we really willing, _fully_ willing, to work with that messiness in our lives, to work with that complexity, to work with our humanity in the context of our friendships, of our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span>? And sometimes we think we are, but if we take a real honest look, the truth is - well, there's a lot of places that we just, "Hmph," actually can't really be bothered to go there.

There's a very beautiful passage from <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Kahlil Gibran" class="internal-link">Kahlil Gibran</a></span> in _The Prophet_. I'm sure some of you know this. And he's talking about friendship. And he says: ^5-4

So there is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, the benefactor, the friend.

###### 6-3
This is very interesting. Can be at that point in the practice, that this is where we just ... [mimes falling asleep] [laughter] The very neutrality means there is nothing in it for us. It becomes a bit abstract. We lose interest. It feels removed. But that effect in itself is actually quite interesting. What is it that makes us lose interest in people? What is it that makes them, makes most of humanity, perhaps - it's interesting: for some people, no one is neutral; there's always some kind of tussle. But what is it that allows people to kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span> to the background for us?

When we're struggling with something, when <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> is struggling with something, we're in a tizzy about something, either <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">wanting to get rid of</a></span> something, pushing something away, or trying to hold on to something, trying to grasp - when there is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> (in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> shorthand), the more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> there is, the more the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>. And what one has then is a very prominent <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> and a prominent sense of one thing that one's in a bit of a tizzy about<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > The more struggle the more clining the more there is a sense of self" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#The more struggle the more clining the more there is a sense of self" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-4

So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> _builds_ self. This is another way of saying self is empty. It depends on our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. It depends on us struggling with something in some way. The more we struggle, the more built up <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> is. And you have <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, and you have _one thing_ with which one is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> to some degree, and everything else, every_one_ else, just fades: "Not interested right now." You've got <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> and this thing, feeding each other - the more thing, the more self; the more self, the more thing. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a></span> is building that process. Everyone else fades to grey: "Not interested." We really need to see this. We need to see this process. What's happening? How is it that self gets built up, a thing gets built up, and everyone else can kind of go to ...? [laughs] ^6-5
###### 6-6
Very, very important to see this. As I said, there are many ways into this _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_ business. And to see the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> - self is something that's built. We <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricate</a></span> it. We need to [huffing noises] huff and puff and blow the house _up_, actually. We need to construct it. And we can actually see this going on. And then we see what that does to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, see what it does to the expansiveness of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. It basically shrinks<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > We can see what that does to the expansiveness to love" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#We can see what that does to the expansiveness to love" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-6
###### 7-1
So there's self, friend, benefactor, neutral, and as I said, there's the difficult category. And sometimes, in fact, the friend, as I said, can find themselves in the difficult category, the category of the person with whom we have difficulty. And this, I think, is a really interesting area, really important area for us to look at<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Sometimes the friend can find themselves in the difficult category" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Sometimes the friend can find themselves in the difficult category" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-1
###### 7-2
What <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> is not, absolutely is not, is making us doormats that people wipe their feet over and walk all over, and basically treat badly. It's not doing that. It's not designed to do that. It's not about being Pollyanna, or whatever the phrase is<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Metta doesnt make us doormats" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Metta doesn't make us doormats" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-2
###### 7-3
So in the context of this, when we have difficulty with someone, whether they were a friend or it's just someone on the street that we don't know, whatever it is, it's actually important to look and really, with care, investigate our relationship to expressing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, expressing "no." Are we able to do that? First of all, are we _able_ to do that? Are we _willing_ to do that? Are we able to do it skilfully? These are, you know, hard challenges for us<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Are we able to say no and if yes do it skillfully" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Are we able to say no and if yes do it skillfully" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-3
###### 7-4
So it may be that expressing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, and expressing a "no," is actually a part of what _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ is. It's actually, in that moment, what _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ looks like, that it's the most loving thing to do and the most healthy thing to do: to express a "no" or express <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> in a way that's helpful<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Its possible that this is what metta looks like in this situation" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#It's possible that this is what metta looks like in this situation" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-4

Sometimes, and this, again, is quite common, there's a real <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of doing that, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of saying "no," a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of standing in one's truth and speaking it, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of expressing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> - very common. I have a very good friend. She suffers from quite severe <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="depression" class="internal-link">depression</a></span> at times. And she's beginning to notice this relationship - it's only part of what goes on for her, and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="depression" class="internal-link">depression</a></span> itself is quite complex, so it's only a strand. But she's beginning to notice that there are times when something happens with someone, and she's angry. Something goes on that she's really angry about, and she feels so fearful of expressing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. She's just beginning to be aware of this now: she turns it in on herself. The next thing she knows, she's in a state of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="depression" class="internal-link">depression</a></span> (which is one of the possibilities of what can happen here). And in her case, it's doubly tragic because, I feel that she's someone with a very natural, very naturally, very deep _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And every time this happens, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="depression" class="internal-link">depression</a></span> comes on, it just closes down her ability to express that and to offer that to others and to herself<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Story anger brings depression" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Story anger brings depression" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-5

Interesting too - terrible phrase, but 'spiritual types' (which actually includes all of us, the kind of people that are in this room right now) ...

It's like there's a real recoiling from it, a real <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of it, or a real assumption that it's really a no-go area. But just to check where one's patterns are with this. Am I the kind of person that goes around barking at people and biting their heads off very quickly? Or am I really reluctant to express that?

And it's a very interesting question with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>.

It's too much out there - with all the consequences. It's really worth our investigating. So I'm talking now about investigating <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> and expressing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> as actually one of the faces of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> - _can_ be, can be. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Anger" class="internal-link">Anger</a></span> is interesting. When we really look at it, and when we're really honest with it, it's usually blind, and it's usually blind in three ways<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Anger is worth investigating as it is usually blind in three way" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Anger is worth investigating as it is usually blind in three way" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-8

**(1)** It's usually **blind to its causes**. So usually something happens, we get angry, and we say, "_You_ are making me angry," or "_This_ is making me angry." And what we don't see in that - it seems so obvious; what we don't see is the whole inner constellation, or both inner and outer constellation of conditions that allow the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> to be. All kinds of assumptions, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>, views, thoughts. What was the state of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> before the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>? Perhaps there was a little bit of irritability and leaning that way anyway. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Anger" class="internal-link">Anger</a></span> comes, and it becomes blind to its causes, and wants to put it on one thing. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma practice</a></span> means to uncover that.

**(2)** Also often **blind to its effects**. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Anger" class="internal-link">Anger</a></span> is blind to its effects - so both energetically and on others, and I'll explain what I mean. When was it? Twenty? More than twenty. Around twenty years ago, I had just started a psychotherapy process, working in psychotherapy with a therapist in America. And it was quite early days, and she said, and it seemed clear, there is obviously some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> there, needs addressing, needs to come out. Get it out. And so she suggested: go to the gym, and get one of those big punchbags, and pummel, pummel the punchbag, and be with that process of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> expressing itself<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Blind to its effects - - Story punching bag" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Blind to its effects - - Story punching bag" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-2
###### 8-3
So I dutifully did that, for quite a while. Huge! [gesturing size of punchbag] [laughs] And what I noticed was that I would punch this thing, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> would indeed come up, and I'd punch away at it really hard. What happened was that the more I punched, and the more _into_ it I got, the more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> came up. So I thought, "Ah, now we're really liberating some stuff." [laughter] And I went, really going for it. And I was quite young. Going to the extent that my knuckles - I was actually wearing boxing gloves, but my knuckles were still bleeding underneath. So I was a very _eager_ client. [laughter] After a certain point, something occurred to me. [laughter] Maybe this is actually _building_ it and not _releasing_ it, which would be the assumption<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > It occurred to me that this is actually building it not realising it" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#It occurred to me that this is actually building it not realising it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-3
###### 8-4
<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Anger" class="internal-link">Anger</a></span> can be blind to its effects. What's going on? We tend to think, "There's such a pressure inside. It needs to release. I need to get it out. It's like a heat, a burning. Get it out! And then, when I get it out I'll feel better." Even if we don't consciously think that, is that the case, always? It can be blind to its effects<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Anger" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Anger" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-4
###### 8-5
It can also be blind to its effects on others. So again, we say, we _voice_ our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, we _vent_ our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> at someone. And really what we want is for the situation to change, or part of what we want. And yet, I think it takes an extraordinarily evolved <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> to have <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> flung at them, energetically, that level of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, and not to react. Just energetically, it's such a strong <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>. We human beings, we're very sensitive, very vulnerable, fragile beings, energetically. Someone, "_Bleurgh!_" _-_ it takes a _very_ evolved person, practising _very hard_ ... [laughter] to just hear that and say, you know, no reaction, "I hear," you know, and just to respond, and not react. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Anger" class="internal-link">Anger</a></span> can be blind to its effects on others<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > It can also be blind to its effects on others" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#It can also be blind to its effects on others" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-5

So part of practice is to really be honest about this, and about these blindnesses, and explore them. Oftentimes, when we feel <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, it feels a lot easier to vent it. And it might feel easier in the moment. But in the long run, it's not. It's really not. What am I building when I vent <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>? What am I crystallizing and conditioning in myself, and in the relationship, and in others? Again, this is one of these quite complex issues, so I just want to, in a way, open it up<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Explore these blindnesses" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Explore these blindnesses" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-7

Is it possible to feel <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, to feel the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, and to express it in a way that the person does not feel dumped on, vomited on, flung at? Some of you may be familiar with, just to say, "I feel angry." It's very different from just ranting at someone. One is taking ownership instead of hurling or dumping the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span> on another. Big difference in effect. Now, that's not easy. And there's no way that I think anyone realistically would say that's easy. It's very challenging<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Is it possible to express anger skilfully" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Is it possible to express anger skilfully" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-1

This whole area of communication, and particularly communicating what's difficult in our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span> - how much of the difficulty we have in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span> is around our lack of skill and care and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> around communication? Such a huge area, and we can easily have a whole <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> talk, a whole day, just on that. And just a little piece - the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> said when there's something difficult to communicate to another, that one speaks what is true, _if it's helpful_.^[MN 58] In other words, if you feel that the person can really hear it, and can learn from it, what's true and helpful, in a helpful way, skilfully - and this is a practice - what's true and helpful, in a helpful way, at the right time. [laughs] So that's _quite_ a ... [laughs] I think it's just a practice. It's really a practice, and of all the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="precepts" class="internal-link">precepts</a></span>, all the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Precepts" data-href="Precepts" class="internal-link">five precepts</a></span>, it's the hardest one. It's such an art, such a skill. And in a way, to learn to hold back and to do it in the right way, in a helpful way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Of all the five precepts its the hardest one" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Of all the five precepts it's the hardest one" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-2
###### 9-3
I think, and I know for myself, and I see it in others, that this is really a learning process. Again, that word 'practice' - it's a practice. It's going to take time. So if I think back, for myself, again, going back twenty years or more, I wasn't even _aware_ of when I felt angry. And then, didn't connect with it. And then, afraid or unable to communicate that to others. And then, learnt, gradually, willing to try and do that, but went way over the other side. So I basically dropped, you know, small thermonuclear devices on people, _really_ going overboard. It was part of the learning process. Luckily I could say sorry in a lot of cases, but it actually fractured a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span>. And again, it was coming out of, in a way, wanting to be earnest, and wanting to address what was actually an imbalance in myself, and wanting to be honest, and wanting to stand in the truth. And yet it was so difficult to do that in a way that was balanced. So we're going to make mistakes, and I think that's okay. Or we neglect to say something when we actually should have<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Story its a learning process" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Story it's a learning process" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-3
###### 9-4
A while ago - can't remember when it was - I had a situation that went on with someone, and I felt quite upset by what was going on. I can't actually remember what it was now! But anyway ... [laughter] And I remember asking to speak with this person, and the first thing I said when I went in to speak with her was, "I really want you to know my intention is not to hurt. I really don't want to hurt in what I'm saying, and I don't want to retaliate. It may be that what I'm saying doesn't come out perfectly. I still feel agitated and upset a little bit, and I don't know if I can say it perfectly, so please just bear that in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and excuse that. But please, please know my intention is not to hurt.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > My intention is not to hurt" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#My intention is not to hurt" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^9-4
###### 9-5
And in a way, I felt that was really helpful, just first thing, saying that, setting up, setting up a kind of context of non-harming, setting up the intention - setting up also the humanity of it, so I could be human, I could be less than perfect, which actually also invited her, or allowed her, to be less than perfect, to be human. And that was something, it felt very, very helpful to do that at the time. Now, of course, if one does something like that, you have to make sure that you really don't have an intention to hurt. You can't just go in there saying, "Yeah, I don't intend to hurt," and then, you know, you've got your ... [laughter] ^9-5
###### 10-1
Sometimes it takes time, sitting with it - couple of minutes, couple of hours, couple of days, couple of weeks, or more - sitting with something that really hurts, working with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, being with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, teasing out what's there, the hurt underneath, etc., the sadness, until we feel pretty sure that we can go in there, and there's very, very little intention to hurt or retaliate, or be the one who's right, or whatever it is. And then we're much more ready to have that conversation. All this is very challenging<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Sometimes it takes a lot of time to explore the anger thoroughly" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Sometimes it takes a lot of time to explore the anger thoroughly" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-1
###### 10-2
Sometimes we find ourselves in relationship on the receiving end of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. Someone is angry at us for what we've done or not done, whatever it is. And then it's a whole skill to hear <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. And this is very interesting too. Again, if I think back, I used to be a person, when people were angry with me - again, and I feel, looking back, and I'm sure many others share this, it was coming out of a kind of earnestness, you know, and really wanting to look at my faults and see where I could grow and open and transform. So someone was angry at me, and would hurl that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, or would just go - you know, back in the eighties, when it was really ... you know, that was the way to do it. [laughter] At least in America it was. [laughter] And what I would do, out of earnestness, was completely open up, energetically: "Yeah, give it to me." [laughter] Because I really wanted to be totally honest and totally open and totally take in what was being said. Maybe I could learn something about myself. Maybe there really was something that I needed to be honest about, and get to the bottom of, and transform<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Story yeah give it to me" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Story yeah give it to me" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-2
###### 10-3
And what I found with that was basically, I was keeled over. I mean, energetically, in some instances, I remember, it would take weeks to recover. I mean, it was so strong, the energetic effect. And then I remember a teacher, Michael, at - I can't remember what it was - a day <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> or an evening class or something, and he said, "You know, we're not obliged to take on or open ourselves to, or even stick around for, someone's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> of rage, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>." And I heard that, and my jaw hung. It seemed completely radical to me. And what he was saying was, you could say to a person, "I really see that you're angry, and I really want to hear what it is that you're upset about, and I really want to hear what's going on. But I'm not prepared to take on that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to open myself to that. So when you feel able to just tell me that in a way that's more calm, then I'm ready to listen. So maybe, you know, go for a walk or whatever.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > We are not obliged to open ourselves to someones energy of anger" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#We are not obliged to open ourselves to someone's energy of anger" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^10-3
###### 10-4
Now ... [laughter] Of course, the person is probably going to ... [laughter] go through the roof, so ... [laughter] I think there has to be some skill in saying, but I think the point is quite interesting. And again, I'm sure I'm not alone in that pattern, so I'm voicing it. But I'm sure I'm not alone in that pattern of, out of earnestness, opening oneself up to that. Do we open ourselves up to listening to what the person has to say? Yes. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, the rage, that violence? Why<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Open up to listening to what the person has to say but not the violence" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Open up to listening to what the person has to say but not the violence" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^10-4

] often comes, a person is often angry, people, individuals, political groups, socio-economic groups, ethnic groups, often angry because they feel unheard. How much at the root of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> is a feeling of being unheard - and a feeling, from that, of powerlessness? A person's not hearing, and I can't do anything about it. Feeling of frustration with that, feeling of hurt, that we feel hurt, and it's not being heard. So individually or with groups<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > [Anger" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#[Anger" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-5
###### 10-6
Someone in a relationship has to take the risk and expresses _I_ think in a situation that's difficult - and again, none of this is easy at all. But in a situation like that, when one person can say to the other, can look and see the hurt that's underneath the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, and then express to the other person _genuine_ feeling: "It really pains me. I feel sad that I hurt you." And there's something going underneath just this clashing at the surface. In a way, when two people are like that, someone has to do that. Someone has to be the one that takes the risk and is vulnerable, and expresses that and softens. Someone has to show their hurt. Not easy, but if that doesn't happen - well, we all know it just keeps battering at that same level. Somehow to say to someone: "I'm really ... It pains me that I hurt you.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Sometimes in a relationship someone has to show their hurt" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Sometimes in a relationship someone has to show their hurt" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^10-6

I feel this is a very important aspect of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_.

Can we begin to explore - this is an option - can we begin to explore a tenderness of touch for ourselves? So this might sound a little, I don't know, hokey for some people, or embarrassing. But what would it be - and we've all got single rooms here, so it's fine to do it.

What is it? One hand touches the other hand, and through the hand, in the touch, through the touch, there is tenderness there. You can actually feel it. And one part of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> is expressing to the other tenderness. Hand on the arm, hand on the chest, hand on the belly - just feel into that, and imagine it, and just feel the tenderness moving through the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>.

Way So to experiment with this. What are the ways that the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ can open up and flow through the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, through the eyes? And there are <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a></span> that are imbued with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>. And in a way, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> go very closely together. How often is it that someone needing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, they come to us, and what they really need is our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> and the fullness of our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, the softness of our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>? And through that very <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, that's actually all they need. They need to be heard, need to be seen, need to be held in that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>. The looking itself expresses the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, carries the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. And can be with each other here, can be with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span>, trees, to look at a tree with that - what is it?

And again, here, as I said on the opening night, I think, no hurry. Nothing to hurry for here. To really slow down. In a way, that slowing down can also open up this tenderness that flows through the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. So stomping down the corridor, slamming doors, and clunking cutlery - you know, of course it's all fine. There's no problem with any of that. But can there actually be, through all these little movements, little interactions, there is actually the tenderness running through? Experiment with it. Touch the handle of a door.

Sometimes this 'slow/hurry' thing, and its relationship in the life, is actually easier to see outside, off <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. So I know if I go to Newton Abbot, and - I'm not saying anything about Newton Abbot. If I go to Newton Abbot and I've got an agenda of things to do, a list, and I've got a limited amount of time, and I'm hurrying through the high street - got to go to the bank, got to go to the chemist, whatever - and somehow, in the very hurrying, the leaning forward, and I'm going through Newton Abbot with my little summary of _what I want_ sort of on the sheet of paper, and that very _what I want_ - basically, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> encapsulated on a piece of paper ...

Versus - and you know, this is actually part of life nowadays, to have to be in a hurry. But versus sometimes being there and dropping that, a little bit, and maybe still getting the stuff done. Dropping that _what I want_ - you can play with this. What happens when you're moving in the hustle, the bustle, the busyness of Newton Abbot high street, wherever it is ... and you just drop that? Possibility for a wider sense of mystery of being to come in, and in that, a wider sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. And one sees: it's life going on. It's life expressing itself. And children moving, and old people, and interactions with shopkeepers, and business transactions, and - it's all just expressing itself. And dogs, and whatever it is - life expressing itself.

Too tight in the _what I want_, and what's the downside? Irritability. Someone just breathes a little bit too loudly next to you, and there is irritability there.

So again, _what I want_ and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, and the struggle with all that is related to the opening and the closing of the heart<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Struggling is related to the opening and the closing of the heart" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Struggling is related to the opening and the closing of the heart" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-2

On any <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and on this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, there is a possibility, as we deepen, as time goes on, to begin slowing down, but also to begin relaxing this struggle with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>: <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a></span> what we don't like, pulling towards us what we like, and this _what I want_ so much. And through relaxing that, it's possible that a stillness comes gradually into the being, just gradually into the being. And the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, the being, in a very unforced way, begins to feel more and more still - very non-linear. And also a silence inside, and the outer silence, can begin to become more prominent<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Stillness and silence become more prominent" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Stillness and silence become more prominent" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-3

As there's more stillness in the being, and more silence, a couple of things, a number of things can happen. One of them is that our sense of priority gets much clearer. So the usual stuff that we're caught up in as feeling very important in our everyday bustle begins to just settle. And what's most important, what's most deeply important to us - which may be the absolute necessity of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, the wish to surrender to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, to open in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> - what's deeply important to us comes more and more to the fore, becomes prominent in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>. It's something that comes out of the stillness and silence<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Priorities get much clearer" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Priorities get much clearer" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-4

Another thing, another aspect that can come up, in a way because of the stillness and the silence, but also because of the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, is memories of things that we've done or not done, that we regret. And with that - we remember we said this, we did this, we didn't, whatever it was - and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> of the memory. How easily that can move into guilt, and just wrapped around, repeating the memory and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> of that. This is a natural part, I think, of doing a _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and also of just being in silence for a while. It will allow this stuff to come to the surface.{INDEX: guilt, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="shame" class="internal-link">shame</a></span>} ^12-5
###### 12-6
A distinction between guilt and remorse. I don't know if these are dictionary definitions, but guilt, I would say, is when we remember something, we don't feel good about it, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> defines itself around it. It's making a conclusion about what we did - making a conclusion about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, rather. We did this, or we didn't do this, and it's saying, "Therefore I am bad." Do you understand? Are we still here ...? [laughter] Guilt is making a conclusion about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>. Remorse, I would say, is making a conclusion about the action. So guilt has a way of making definitions and binding oneself in a definition of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>: "I'm bad. I'm useless. I'm a failure. I'm not a good person." Remorse is saying, "In the future, I would rather not act that way. I want to choose something different." It's saying something about the action. It's forward-looking, creative, open, whereas guilt is backward-looking and just stays around <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Guild vs remorse" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Guild vs remorse" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-6

So this, as we let go more, the sense of stillness and sense of silence can begin to deepen, _can_ begin to deepen for some people, and can begin to become very prominent. The actual sense of silence - so-called 'inner' and so-called 'outer' - begins to become more and more prominent, _can_ begin to come more prominent. And it's almost as if the silence takes on a fabric of itself, a meaning of itself. Almost a mystical sense of silence can open up. That can have everything to do with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. It's almost as if the silence holds <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> in it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Silence takes on a fabric a meaning of itself" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Silence takes on a fabric a meaning of itself" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-1

There's a beautiful poem by <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Pablo Neruda" class="internal-link">Pablo Neruda</a></span>, which again, some of you will know this. It's called "Keeping Quiet."^[Pablo Neruda, _Extravagaria: A Bilingual Edition_, tr.

The more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> there is, the more the sense of silence, for some people, can become prominent and can have a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> in it. Usual human <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> is preoccupied with things, events, things that happen inside or outside. And that can begin to just die down a little bit, and there's a sense of something _other_ in and through the silence - _can_ be, for some people<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > The more letting go there is the more the silence can have love in it" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#The more letting go there is the more the silence can have love in it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-4

And in that silence, for some people, sometimes, it's almost as if the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ becomes something that we are held in, that we receive. This silence that seems to permeate the universe has <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> in it. Everything, our being, everything that comes up is held in that, held in that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. So usually, when we do the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, we have a sense of _me_ doing it. There's self, and there's effort involved, and the phrases, and we're creating this _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_. But again, talking about aspects of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, facets of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, it's not always like that. And there are other ways that it can reveal itself. And so, for some people, the whole way that we're going about it, with phrases, etc., is not the way that's most helpful. For some people, a much more devotional practice, using Green Tārā, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Kuan Yin</a></span> (the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Avalokiteśvara</a></span>), <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">Jesus</a></span> - beings, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Archetype" data-href="Archetype" class="internal-link">archetypal</a></span> beings of great <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> - tuning into them, devoting oneself to them, and receiving, in a way, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> that way. It's not always that _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ feels it's coming from <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Its not always that metta feels its coming from the self" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#It's not always that metta feels it's coming from the self" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-5

When, or if, there's this sense of silence - it's actually not that uncommon. I have a friend who, for years, never did any practice - _very_ sporadic kind of flirting with different practices - and she was working somewhere one day and went to get lunch in a restaurant. And she said, just suddenly, she felt like she was sitting inside God's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. And the whole restaurant was - her words - "inside God's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>." And she said, "Why isn't anyone talking about this? Why are they all pretending it's not happening?" [laughter] ^13-6
###### 14-1
But it was interesting because it didn't come out of any particular practice or anything, it just sort of spontaneously arose. But this is something that it is much more likely to come out of practice. It's as if something is unveiled. Some quality of the universe is unveiled<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Its as if something is unveiled" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#It's as if something is unveiled" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-1

> Practising after the meeting in the library, an old, well-known, apparently insoluble <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> arose very quickly. Already aware that there wasn't any wholehearted <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span>, yet an attempt to embrace the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> lovingly, coming from a hidden agenda of wanting it to go away, to dissolve. Somehow it was clear that this unloving attitude was known to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, and so it wouldn't pass, but intensify. What was needed was very clearly a pure embrace of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, breathing to expand the capacity of accepting the unacceptable and relax<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Embrace pain lovingly" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Embrace pain lovingly" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-4

> Breathing to expand the capacity to love the unloved and relax. And then, a change: Deep, pitch-black darkness, familiar though, was around. And the thought was: "Even the unloved is surrounded by <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> all the time anyway." And it went on: "We all are surrounded, loved, all the time anyway. We may not know. We may not have experienced it yet, but <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is around all along, awaiting us to open up to it, to become sensitive to it, to receive it.

If that is so, doesn't it bring with it a kind of responsibility, as it were, to expand our capacity to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> unconditionally?

Very lovely. And I told her that she wasn't, of course. English isn't even her first language. Very beautiful.

There's the warmth or whatever it is there, and we feel that. And sometimes that feeling actually becomes relatively steady. And then we can let the phrases go, if that feels helpful - could just let the phrases go and be with that feeling, and just give ourselves to that feeling and enjoy and open to it, and feel into the texture of it, and radiate it. And let the phrases go<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Its possible to let the phrases go and feel into the texture of warmth" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#It's possible to let the phrases go and feel into the texture of warmth" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-1

Sometimes that can deepen. And we may be directing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> towards the friend or whoever it is, the neutral, the benefactor. And it seems at first that there was a person _here_ and a person _there_, and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is moving towards them. It can deepen. And it's almost like the sense of the person begins to _blur_ a bit. And there is just the sense of two hearts, and a flow, a radiation, between the two hearts. And even that can deepen. And can become, at times, a sense of a kind of communion of hearts. There's just really one heart, one <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, imbued with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. Beautiful possibility - not forever, but for a moment, for a stretch of time. Again, not to snatch at any of this. I'm just saying what can come sometimes from the practice<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > There can be a sense of flow between the two hearts a communion of hearts" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#There can be a sense of flow between the two hearts a communion of hearts" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-2

But it's still very important. It's extremely important. Our usual sense of things is separateness, is _not_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>: "I'm here, you're there - separate things, separate beings, separate selves." And to begin, in a way, opening ourselves, getting a taste of some other sense, a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>. It's not an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ultimate truth" class="internal-link">ultimate truth</a></span>, but it's extremely important, an extremely beautiful opening<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > Sensing oneness and non-separateness is a beautiful opening" data-href="Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Sensing oneness and non-separateness is a beautiful opening" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-3

And again, _can_ be that a person goes in and out of that kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> many times. And the more significant thing - rather than staying in a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>, which is not ultimately true - the more significant thing is actually the question, "What is true?" Typical, unenlightened <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> assumes separate self to be true. It's just - it's a given! It's obvious!
