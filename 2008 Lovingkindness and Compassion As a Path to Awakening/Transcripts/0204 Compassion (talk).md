###### 1-1
So this morning we introduced the [[compassion]] practice, and I really want to, in a way, amplify and extend some of the things I talked about this morning, and to fill that out, to broaden it, and look at what's involved in the practice of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and also the question, what actually _is_ <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>? What does that word mean[[Compassion (talk)#What does the word "compassion" mean|?]] ^1-1
###### 1-2
So as you know, [[compassion]] is the second of the _[[Brahmaviharas|brahmavihāras]]_. [[Metta|Loving-kindness]], <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, [[Happiness|joy]], [[equanimity]] - it's the second one. We _could_ say that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is the heart's natural response to [[Dukkha|suffering]] when not preoccupied with self, or not caught up in a negative [[The Self|self-view]]. [[Compassion]], perhaps - one [[Ways of looking|way of looking]] at <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is the natural response of the heart to <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> when not preoccupied with self, or not caught up in a negative <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" href="The+Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span> - so it includes _our_ <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion is the heart's natural response to suffering|.]] ^1-2
###### 1-3
And [[compassion]] is that quality, that [[energy]], that wants to alleviate the [[Dukkha|suffering]] that it meets. It wants to do something about it. It wants to heal it - wants to alleviate, wants to heal, wants to soothe, wants to comfort, wants to free that <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> either in ourselves or in another being, either by changing the circumstance, by comforting, by providing some [[Insight|understanding]] - in any way at all. And as I said this morning, when the stream of [[Metta|loving-kindness]], the stream of _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> -_ if it's running, when it meets <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, it turns organically and very naturally into <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" href="Metta" class="internal-link">Loving-kindness</a></span> meets <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and it will become <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> in that moment[[Compassion (talk)#It wants to alleviate the suffering|.]] ^1-3
###### 1-4
So we have this word '[[compassion]],' and it's a great - it's a beautiful word. In a way, '<span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>,' like all these other [[Dharma]] words, is a kind of composite. There are many factors and aspects involved in it. It's great to have one word, and it's helpful to have one word, and to know what we mean when we say that. But when we start really looking at what <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is, it has many, many aspects to it[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion has many aspects to it|.]] ^1-4
###### 1-5
[[Compassion]] includes [[empathy]], and I'll speak about that more tonight. It includes giving, so giving is an aspect of [[compassion]]. What are we giving? And as such, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is something very active. Even if it's just energetically on the cushion, in the [[meditation]], but very much in the world, it's giving something[[Compassion (talk)#It includes empathy and giving|.]] ^1-5
###### 1-6
[[Compassion]] also includes [[equanimity]], this [[steadiness]] of the being, [[Steadiness|steadiness of the mind]] and the heart. And that's actually an indispensable factor of [[compassion]], if we want our <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to be sustainable, to be strong, to be open, to last in the world, to be able to bear up, keep open, face up to the [[Dukkha|suffering]] that we encounter in this world. <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Compassion" href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a></span> has [[Insight|wisdom]] in it. And this is really crucial. In a way, as both <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span> goes deeper and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> goes deeper, they begin to really come together. But <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> as such is not blind. <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Compassion" href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a></span> has in it some degree of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of what the causes of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> are, and in it, a willingness and a wish to uncover the causes of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, at as deep a level as possible. So very much has <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span> in it. If we talk about <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span> and [[insight]], that's what that means: we want to understand how <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> comes about, in ways that bring [[freedom]][[Compassion (talk)#Compassion also includes the steadiness of equanimity and wisdom|.]] ^1-6
###### 1-7
[[Compassion]] of course has _[[Metta|mettā]]_ in it, has <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span> in it. <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Compassion" href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a></span> has [[acceptance]] in it, so that's an interesting one. Alongside the wish to alleviate [[Dukkha|suffering]], it also has <span class="transcript"><a data-href="acceptance" href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span> of the fact of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Compassion" href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a></span> can have humour in it, often _does_ have humour in it. So it's not necessarily a heavy [[energy]]; it can be very light. <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Compassion" href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a></span> has listening. Listening is very much a quality of [[compassion]]. Sometimes we encounter someone, we're with someone - there's nothing we can do for their situation except listen, except open ourselves in that way. And that's <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. When in a way one's giving the listening, although it's a kind of receiving, one's giving that, offering that. Opening - <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> has this quality of opening. <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Compassion" href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a></span> actually has [[Happiness|joy]] in it. <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Happiness" href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a></span> is a factor of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Compassion" href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a></span> has [[Devotion|faith]] in it - this is a very interesting one - has <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a></span> in it[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion has kindness in it and acceptance and listening and a quality of opening and happiness and faith|.]] ^1-7
###### 2-1
And like we said with the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice, it's not just a feeling. So sometimes we get a definite _feeling_ of [[compassion]] and that tenderness and that resonance and that warmth flowing out, that [[healing]] [[energy]] flowing out. But it's not just a feeling. It's actually much more than that. And if in our life our <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is restricted to when we _feel_ it, that's too limited. Sometimes in our life we _don't_ feel it, but we act still. We _do_, we _act_ with <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. We embody that intention. We cannot feel it all the time because [[feelings]] are [[Impermanence|impermanent]] - same as what we talked about with the _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_[[Compassion (talk)#Like metta compassion is not just a feeling|.]] ^2-1
###### 2-2
Now, most people, if we're honest with ourselves, the relationship to [[compassion]] or the idea of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is ambivalent. We have a pretty ambivalent relationship to the intention of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Very, very common, and very understandable and easy, to see <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, regard it as a kind of burden. Here, somehow, am I going to be burdened with the [[Dukkha|suffering]] of the world? And everyone in this room is aware of the kind of magnitude and enormity of the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world. And somehow the idea of opening to that feels like a burden - despite, or alongside, our best spiritual aspirations[[Compassion (talk)#It's easy to see compassion as a kind of burden|.]] ^2-2
###### 2-3
We aspire to be compassionate, and yet there's this ambivalence. We also feel, "Well [sighs] ... I don't know. I don't know." We feel, we [[fear]] that [[compassion]] will overwhelm us, will drown us, will make us unhappy. We _can_ <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fear" href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> that. When [[insight]] gets deeper, we realize that actually, lack of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, if our hearts are _not_ open in <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, _that's_ actually [[Dukkha|suffering]]. Something about the closed-over heart, the hardened heart - that's <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. And we could talk about, again - it's not a great word, but this word 'maturity' in practice. Part of maturity in practice is when that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> has got deep enough, that we know that it's more <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> for the heart to be closed and to live without <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> than it might be to feel overwhelmed by <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>[[Compassion (talk)#We fear that compassion will overwhelm us|.]] ^2-3
###### 2-4
So there's this ambivalence. And at the same time as this [[fear]] or trepidation we might feel, at the same time we have a real intuitive - I think most of us wouldn't be in this room if we didn't - this intuitive [[love]] and almost a yearning for [[compassion]]. It's like we sense something there. The being, the heart, senses a possibility for itself, senses a depth of possibility for itself, and [[beauty]] for itself. And a part of us yearns for that, longs for that, senses that possibility, because I think a part of us realizes that through <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and in <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, there's a very deep connection going on. There's a very deep _reconnection_ going on. We are reconnecting to ourselves, some very deep aspect of ourselves, of our being, of our heart. Reconnecting with our heart. Connecting and reconnecting with 'other.' Very much and very deep - the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice has something very deep about that reconnecting, and we long for that. As much as we shore up our own individuality and separateness, we long for this connection that comes so powerfully through <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice[[Compassion (talk)#Through compassion we are reconnecting with our heart|.]] ^2-4
###### 2-5
Sense of sweetness, energizing We may also have a sense of the sweetness in [[compassion]] practice. So even though there's this trepidation, we can sense that there's a sweetness there for the heart, a really lovely sweetness. [[Compassion]], too, is energizing. It's actually an [[Energy|energizing quality]]. I'm going to come back to this later. <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Compassion" href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a></span> should be energizing rather than tiring. <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Compassion" href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a></span> should also be pleasant rather than unpleasant. Even though we're opening ourselves to [[Dukkha|suffering]], we're tuning into <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, we're looking at it, we're willing to let the heart resonate with it - still, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is a [[Pleasantness|pleasant quality]]. It's a pleasant abiding, a sublime or divine abiding[[Compassion (talk)#Energizing rather tiring pleasant rather than unpleasant|.]] ^2-5
###### 3-1
There's warmth in it. There's lovely warmth in [[compassion]]. And as the [[Buddha]] would say, it's something that gives the being [[nobility]]. It gives the being a very deep and beautiful, organic <span class="transcript"><a data-href="nobility" href="nobility" class="internal-link">nobility</a></span>, a natural <span class="transcript"><a data-href="nobility" href="nobility" class="internal-link">nobility</a></span> to the being. Something of which we can feel proud. When that quality is there, we can feel proud in a very healthy, non-egoistic way[[Compassion (talk)#There's lovely warmth in compassion and nobility something to be proud of|.]] ^3-1
###### 3-2
There's also a sense - we might have this sense with [[compassion]] that the movement into the depths of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> begins to, or _will_ begin to, dissolve the kind of prison of self-interest. So we may feel in our lives, or the more practice - as we begin to practice, we may feel how this self-interest is a prison. We're binding ourselves in it. So we have this sense, this intuitive sense, that as we go into <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, perhaps that prison of self-interest will be a little dissolved, or a _lot_ dissolved. Now, we may be very attracted to that, but again, we may be pretty ambivalent about it[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion dissolves the prison of self-interest|.]] ^3-2
###### 3-3
In a way, a fundamental part of the fundamental [[Avijja|delusion]], Dharmically speaking, is this belief in a separate, independent self. Somehow we're caught up in that belief, and we believe it, and we keep reinforcing it with [[the self]]-interest. And through practices like [[Metta|loving-kindness]] and [[compassion]], and as the [[insight]] comes out of those practices, as the _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ deepens, as the heart opens, there is a sense of that self softening and opening, in a very non-linear way - very gradual, glimpses of it at first, then a bit more, etc. The [[The Self|sense of self]] begins to soften, can begin to open, and [[Insight|insights]] into the whole [[nature]] of self and other, etc., come with that - _can_ come with that[[Compassion (talk)#Gradually the sense of self begins to soften|.]] ^3-3
###### 3-4
But alongside that is a sort of very basic [[insight]], and it's that we begin to realize that we can't really be fully fulfilled pursuing [[happiness]] through [[The Self|self-centredness]]. It just takes time, but eventually the coin just drops. It just drops. This is the pattern we inherit. You could [say], in strict [[Dharma]] terms, we inherit if from our previous lives, this self-[[Avijja|delusion]] that's caught up in a [[Ways of looking|way of looking]] for <span class="transcript"><a data-href="happiness" href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, searching for <span class="transcript"><a data-href="happiness" href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, going about it through <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" href="The+Self" class="internal-link">self-centredness</a></span>. Something can begin to happen through <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> and through [[compassion]]: that whole project, we realize, cannot fulfil us. It's backwards, and in fact, searching for <span class="transcript"><a data-href="happiness" href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> through <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" href="The+Self" class="internal-link">self-centredness</a></span> actually leads to [[Dukkha|suffering]]. And we can all say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know." But it takes a while, it really takes a while to digest this in a way that one's living it out[[Compassion (talk)#We can't really be fully fulfilled pursuing happiness through self-centredness|.]] ^3-4
###### 3-5
But I would say, and I really would say this, that there can come a point with practices like these - [[insight]] and [[love]] and [[compassion]] practices - it's almost like the [[consciousness]] reaches an edge. And one can feel rising in oneself a conviction: "I'm not interested any more in living a life with self at the [[centre]]. I'm just" - that whole view and outlook of life which seems so natural, _so_ natural, it just begins to lose its compulsivity or its convincingness. And a person can really reach a point - something's like, "It just doesn't do it for me any more. I'm just not interested in that any more." Something has, you could say, broken in the heart. Something has melted in the heart. Don't want self to be the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="centre" href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> of the stage any more, or the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="centre" href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> of the life stage necessarily. As these practices go on - again, they're very non-linear, but there comes a deeper and deeper commitment to this, a deeper and deeper commitment to <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and to <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and to living less from [[the self]], about <span class="transcript"><a data-href="the self" href="the+self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, for <span class="transcript"><a data-href="the self" href="the+self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>. So the [[Dalai Lama]] is fond of saying, "My religion is [[Metta|kindness]]."^[Margaret Gee, _Words of Wisdom: Quotes from His Holiness the Dalai Lama_ (Kansas City: Andrew McMeel Publishing, 2001), 23] So instead of explaining all the complex Buddhist philosophy, etc., he just says, "My religion is <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>. My religion is <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>.[[Compassion (talk)#"My religion is kindness My religion is compassion "|"]] ^3-5
###### 4-1
So, like I mentioned - was it the last talk? - we need to be asking questions with this. [[Compassion]] practice has a lot of [[cultivation]] in it, but it also has a lot of questioning in it. All these practices, there's an aliveness of inquiry. And part of what we're asking is, what is [[compassion]]? What does it mean? But we're also asking this other question, or we're asking a _number_ of other questions. And it's important, it's _crucial,_ it's really crucial for a life of practice that we're asking the right questions both of ourselves, of our lives, but of our practice. Are we asking the right questions? It's so important[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion practice has a lot of cultivation in it but also questioning|.]] ^4-1

I only know two things about [[Gertrude Stein]], the writer. One of them is that when she was on her deathbed, she was surrounded by her sort of entourage of admirers. You know <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Gertrude Stein" href="Gertrude+Stein" class="internal-link">Gertrude Stein</a></span> the writer? [laughter] She was surrounded by this entourage of admirers. She was obviously dying. She was slipping in and out of [[consciousness]], in and out of - I don't know if it was coma or what, but in and out of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="consciousness" href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, certainly. And it appeared to the people around her that she would sort of go into the 'next world,' so to speak, pass beyond, and then come back. And she kept doing that. And one of her entourage, whose name, I think, was Mildred something or other (I can't remember), because it seemed like she was passing beyond and sort of coming back - "Well, maybe she's coming back with some [[Insight|wisdom]] and knowledge that she could impart to us of greater things." And so when Gertrude sort of reappeared and had a bit of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="consciousness" href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, she said, "Gertrude, what's the answer?" And Gertrude sort of opened her eyes. "Mildred, what's the question?"^[Cf. James R. Mellow, _Charmed Circle: Gertrude Stein and Company_ (New York: Praeger, 1974), 468] [laughter] ^4-2
###### 4-3
And in a way, it's very much ... We're looking for answers, but are we actually clear what the right questions are? What are the right questions in life? One of the questions, a fundamental question is, how do we [[Cultivation|cultivate]] [[compassion]]? Not just what is it, but how do we go about it? What brings it about? It's very much a part of - we need to be actively engaged in that questioning. And so, as I mentioned this morning, there are many techniques involved, many techniques. We've chosen the phrases. It's fine. It's a good one to start with. _[[Tonglen]]_ was mentioned, this Tibetan practice of - literally it means 'giving and taking' or 'taking and giving.' Very similar - we take in the [[Dukkha|suffering]], and we give out the [[healing]], the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. A person might wish to tune in, in a devotional way, to the [[energy]] of a [[bodhisattva]], [[Avalokiteshvara|Kuan Yin]], the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="bodhisattva" href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a></span> of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> (<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Avalokiteśvara</a></span> is the Sanskrit name), [[Jesus]] Christ, some being who in an [[Archetype|archetypal]] way embodies <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and just tuning the being into those qualities, devoting oneself to that being and the qualities that being brings[[Compassion (talk)#Cultivating compassion through Tonglen or through devotion|.]] ^4-3
###### 4-4
[[Insight]] practice itself will bring [[compassion]]. Why? Because [[insight]] is this deep questioning into, "Where does [[Dukkha|suffering]] come from?" And so its correlate, or its exact opposite side of the coin, will be <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. In asking the very question - "How does <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> come about?" - in asking that very deeply, the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> will come automatically. So one _could_ just give oneself to very deep <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> practice, and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> will definitely come. But of course, developing <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is not something that we just do in a formal way, like it's not just something we do in formal [[Meditation|meditation practice]]. It, in a way, _can_ become or _needs_ to become a current in our life. There's a current of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. What is it to live a life that has that beautiful, deep current of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> running, in a way, in a very central place in the life?

So what [[Cultivation|nurtures]] [[compassion]]? What allows it to grow? The sort of simplest piece of it, the most fundamental piece, is a willingness to open and to touch [[Dukkha|suffering]]. It's a willingness to allow the heart to open, to be touched by <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, to draw close, to keep the eyes open, to keep the being open, and touch, witness, feel <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. That's what the [[Buddha]] calls the 'proximate condition' - actually what the _[[commentaries]]_ call the 'proximate condition' - for <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>.^[Cf. Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa, _The Path of Purification: Visuddhimagga_, tr. Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli (Onalaska, WA: Pariyatti, 1999), 310] Now, willingness to open and touch <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> - for a lot of people in the world, that's not an obvious choice. There's <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> - "See you later! I don't want to know. I want to get as far away from it as possible. I want to protect myself, protect the heart. I don't want to feel that. I don't want to be hurt. It's too much. I don't want to be bothered" - either one's own <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> or the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world[[Compassion (talk)#Willingness to open and touch suffering nurtures compassion|.]] ^4-5
###### 5-1
So it's actually not obvious to human beings that this is necessary. It's not obvious. Maybe for many if not all the people in this room, it does feel obvious by now. But that's probably because you've heard it over and over in [[Dharma|Dharma teachings]] or other - spiritual intuition or whatever. But it's actually not _that_ obvious. We need reminding of it. So even in the context of this [[retreat]], we actually need reminding of it, that we want to develop this willingness to open to [[Dukkha|suffering]] and to be touched by it. Guarding, watching out, that we don't go numb through overwhelm. So for instance, watching the news every day, reading the newspaper every day, can actually be too much, and the heart just gets numb. So taking care of that ability to open and be touched[[Compassion (talk)#We need reminding of it that we want to develop the willingness to be touched by suffering|.]] ^5-1
###### 5-2
Slowly, over time, we develop a confidence that we can do this. We actually develop a confidence in the heart's capacity to draw close to [[Dukkha|suffering]] and not be bowled over. That comes definitely with time. We become more confident in our own capacity to do that. So this willingness to open and to be touched by <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. As I said, [[insight]], and the deeper we go into <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> and this question of how <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> arises, that will automatically, _should_ automatically bring with it [[compassion]], particularly this strand of _[[Anatta|anattā]]_ that we keep picking up in this [[retreat]], and going into that. The more we let go of self, the looser - rather, the more we loosen our identification, the more <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is allowed into the being. It's like literally there is more space in the heart when we're less constricting around self-definition, self-views, ownership, identification[[Compassion (talk)#The confidence in the heart's capacity comes with time; anatta|.]] ^5-2
###### 5-3
Action. So, this is an interesting one. Sometimes as meditators we can tend to assume that all I need to do is sit here all day, or enough hours, sit and walk, sit and walk, sit and walk - and _bada-bing, bada-boom_, there it is! [laughs] Maybe, but maybe not. Action. So maybe [[compassion]] deepens through acting compassionately, through putting ourselves in situations of service, situations of volunteering, etc., where that's the actual environment. One actually acts on it. So there's certainly a movement from formal practice that flows out into the life, but the other way round as well. The actions in our life will flow back into the heart and the [[consciousness]] when we come back to sit. Most things in [[Dharma]] work both ways in terms of causality[[Compassion (talk)#Action i e putting ourselves in situations of service|.]] ^5-3

The [[Buddha]] has this very lovely piece of advice, and he says if you want to deepen in [[Insight|wisdom]], associate with the wise. Basically hang out with people with [[insight]], hang out with people who've gone deep into practice and who are living that <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>. Hang out with them, associate, let it rub off, let yourself learn from that.^[Iti 104] Well, we could say, if you want [[compassion]] to grow, associate with the compassionate. Associate with those who have given themselves to service. And there are plenty of bodhisattvas in this world, living out a life of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, both in the first world and the second world and the third world and - all of it. And one can seek out these people and be around them. There are a lot of remarkable beings out there. And just to let that rub off. Let something of their <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, but also, in a way, their _abandon,_ because there's [[freedom]] in <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And one gets the sense of letting their _abandon_ and their <span class="transcript"><a data-href="freedom" href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> rub off on the being. The being absorbs that. Something very beautiful, I think, in that[[Compassion (talk)#Associate with the compassionate|.]] ^5-4

What [[Cultivation|nurtures]] [[compassion]]? [[Happiness]] <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nurtures</a></span> <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> as well. So this is an interesting one too. I have a friend. I think I mentioned her the other day in one of the talks. She suffers from [[depression]] periodically. And in those periods of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="depression" href="depression" class="internal-link">depression</a></span> she is unable to manifest, to open her heart, to allow to flow out of her what's actually very, very beautiful and deep <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> that she has in her heart. So taking care of our [[happiness]] - through all the different ways, cultivating the beautiful qualities, [[generosity]], _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_, _[[Metta|mettā]]_, all the rest of it, building the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="happiness" href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> gradually over our life - that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="happiness" href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> allows <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. It's a foundation for <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. The more <span class="transcript"><a data-href="happiness" href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, actually, the more <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>[[Compassion (talk)#Taking care of happiness allows compassion|.]] ^6-1

I think I heard [[Mother Teresa]] say once that she wouldn't take on a nun who wanted to work in her order (which is, you know, great service; that's their primary thing, working with the poorest of the poor in Calcutta), she wouldn't take on a young woman or an older woman who wanted to be a nun unless that [[Happiness|joy]] was there, either there already or very much there coming from the giving. That she would just say, "No, it's not right for you." So this is _one_ piece, but taking care of our [[happiness]] is significant[[Compassion (talk)#Story Mother Teresa not taking on a nun unless that joy was there|.]] ^6-2
###### 6-3
We might ask the flip-side question: what blocks [[compassion]]? And this is, again, a very important question. What blocks <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>? If you remember when we were talking about [[Metta|loving-kindness]], and we talked about the [[near enemy]] of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> being attached [[love]], <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> that had strings attached - so there's one <span class="transcript"><a data-href="near enemy" href="near+enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a></span> of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>. There are _four_ [[Near enemy|near enemies]] of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, which in a way gives an idea of - it's actually a more subtle quality, and it's a richer quality. And in a way, it's a deeper quality. So it's very delicate. So the four are: (1) [[fear]], (2) [[anger]], (3) [[pity]] (not _[[Piti|pīti]]_, but <span class="transcript"><a data-href="pity" href="pity" class="internal-link">pity</a></span>), and (4) [[grief]].^[Grief is identified as compassion's near enemy in Buddhaghosa, _The Path of Purification_, 311-2. Pity is identified as compassion's near enemy in Ayya Khema, _Being Nobody, Going Nowhere: Meditations on the Buddhist Path_ (Somerville, MA: Wisdom, 1987), 36. Anger, fear, and grief are listed as near enemies of compassion in Sharon Salzberg, _Lovingkindness: The Revolutionary Art of Happiness_ (Boston: Shambhala, 1995), 91] [[Fear]], <span class="transcript"><a data-href="anger" href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="pity" href="pity" class="internal-link">pity</a></span>, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="grief" href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>. And I'll go into these a little bit[[Compassion (talk)#Four near enemies of compassion fear anger pity grief|.]] ^6-3
###### 6-4
But first to reiterate this point that I said in that other talk, I think: it's not wrong that these come up and come into our practice of [[compassion]], either in formal [[meditation]] or in our life. They _will_ come. They actually should come. It's not wrong at all to expect them. Absolutely to expect them. It's part of our humanity. It's also part of how we learn, how we learn what <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> really is in its purity. And I remember when I first heard about this, and sort of reflecting on the presence of these qualities in my life, and just actually wondering, "Well, maybe I've _never_ experienced <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Maybe I have no idea what it is." And that's probably swinging to too extreme a view, because I think we _all_ know what <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is, and we have _all_ experienced that. But it's good to bring in this questioning. So this questioning is, as I said, as much a part of learning this practice as the actual [[cultivation]] and the _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ and all that[[Compassion (talk)#Expect them it's part of humanity and how we learn|.]] ^6-4
###### 6-5
**(1) [[Fear]]**, first one, [[fear]]. Touched on this. We <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fear" href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> opening to [[Dukkha|suffering]]. We <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fear" href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> that if I open to this person's <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, it's going to hurt me. I'm going to feel hurt by it - so common, so normal. We <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fear" href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> that how can little old me hold all the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that's in the world, even open to a small fraction of it? How can _I_ hold that? This little [[The Self|sense of self]] will feel overwhelmed. It will feel too much. There's a real <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fear" href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of that. Unfortunately, the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fear" href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> itself is not neutral. And the presence of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fear" href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> actually tends to either make us feel overwhelmed, which is what we were fearing anyway, and/or increases our sense of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> when we are open to the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of others. So the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fear" href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is exactly doing what we're afraid we would feel anyway. It's having the opposite effect. I'll come back to this one, the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="fear" href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>[[Compassion (talk)#1 Fear|.]] ^6-5
###### 7-1
**(2) [[Anger]]**. This is a really interesting one, [[anger]]. Now, oftentimes we witness [[Dukkha|suffering]] in the world, any form of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> - social, environmental, political - all kinds of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. We just witness one person being cruel and hurtful to another, to animals, etc., to the natural world. How easy it is, and understandable, how easy it is, for the [[compassion]] to kind of get diverted, and instead of staying with the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, we veer off. The heart veers off into a kind of righteous <span class="transcript"><a data-href="anger" href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> - _so_ common and so, in a way, normal and easy for that to happen. Instead of staying with the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> in relation to that, we veer off into blame, judgment - either of ourselves or another. Or in the case of ourselves, "I shouldn't be feeling this" - and we judge ourselves just for feeling, for experiencing <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. But often we're pointing the finger at someone else and blaming and getting angry, feeling justified in the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="anger" href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, and we've moved away from the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>[[Compassion (talk)#2 Righteous Anger|.]] ^7-1
###### 7-2
So it's quite a subtle, sort of seductive movement away - very common. [[Anger]] is complex, and I touched on that also in another talk. But Dharmically speaking, that movement - the blame and the judgment - it's missing an [[Insight|understanding]]. It's missing the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of the causes, of what really, really does _cause_ both [[Dukkha|suffering]] and what allows someone to act in ways that cause <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. It's missing the [[dependent origination]] of that, and I'll explain what I mean[[Compassion (talk)#The blame and the judgement which comes with anger is a seductive movement which misses an understanding|.]] ^7-2
###### 7-3
About three or four years ago - I can't remember - I did a couple of months' personal [[retreat]] on [[Metta|loving-kindness]] and [[compassion]]. And when I got to the difficult category, I had one person that I knew and two people that I didn't know. So I had a selection, an assortment, of difficult people. And the two people are two politicians - I won't say who they are, but who it seemed to me, you know, a lot of the stuff that was happening in the world and is happening, they had a part in it, put it that way. But then as I began to take them on as part of the difficult person, I started to reflect, or needed to begin to reflect, instead of just "They're terrible," etc., beginning to reflect on the [[Dependent Origination|causes and conditions]] that, in a way, brought them into being, enabled them to be, to act, to choose, to be blind in ways that they seem blind. And in one particular politician, in the instance of one of them, just reflecting, "Well, look at his family. Look at his father and the lineage of where, what he came from. What was he educated with?" The whole movement right from day one in his life was to see a certain way, to see the world a certain way, to see others a certain way, to see self a certain way. And was educated that way. And probably through education institutions, etc. And beginning to take it away from self, _his_ self, and see more in terms of the conditions that came together[[Compassion (talk)#Story Two politicians as difficult persons|.]] ^7-3
###### 7-4
Also, to see that a person can be causing [[Dukkha|suffering]] for an other. When they cause the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> for an other, they're actually causing <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> for themselves. So it might just be that they're in the world in a way that's greedy. It's not any obviously overt hurting, but they're just greedy. But what are they cultivating? What's going on for their [[consciousness]], for their heart, for the growth and evolution of their heart? In the world, choosing that way, and they're actually cultivating greediness through acting on, through choosing. They're cultivating greed[[Compassion (talk)#When a person causes a suffering for someone else they're actually causing suffering for themselves|.]] ^7-4
###### 7-5
Cultivating, developing, reinforcing - remember these [[habit]] pattern things we keep talking about. You get a record in a groove. And we're saying, with the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ and [[compassion]], you can change that groove. Someone might be in the world reinforcing the groove of insensitivity, of [[The Self|self-preoccupation]]. These are all grooves of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="habit" href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span>. And so we might look at this person, politician, or whoever it is, and we might think, "They don't seem to be [[Dukkha|suffering]]. They seem to be causing <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, but I don't see any <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. I see them smiling. I see them rich. I see them going on holiday." But I have a question: how much deep [[happiness]] is available for someone cultivating those qualities of heart, cultivating greed long-term? How much deep <span class="transcript"><a data-href="happiness" href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> is available to them? Cultivating insensitivity long-term - so, sure, they might have the riches, and they might have this and that. But in the heart, how much deep <span class="transcript"><a data-href="happiness" href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> is available? They're actually - when _any_ of us acts that way in the world, we're closing the doors for the possibility of deep <span class="transcript"><a data-href="happiness" href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>[[Compassion (talk)#Reinforced grooves of habit can close the doors for the possibility of deep happiness|.]] ^7-5

I remember when I lived in the States. In the last couple of years, I lived in Boston - well, I lived in Boston all the time. In the last couple of years, I moved away from the [[centre]] of the city and out to a suburb that was more kind of green and leafy and quieter. And a little time after arriving there, I would go for walks and stuff and enjoy the green, and I began to notice how many SUVs there were. You know what SUVs are? I don't know what the English ...

And it was at some point during those couple of years, 9/11 happened, and the terrorist attacks, etc. And then, I kept being struck by this. Are people not seeing the connections? You know, my rudimentary political analysis - are people _not_ seeing the connection between oil, American oil interests in the Gulf, and SUVs, and oil consumption, and then [[anger]], etc.? Not to get into politics right now, but ..[[Compassion (talk)#Are people not seeing the connection after 9 11|.]] ^8-4
###### 8-5
And I began to feel more and more agitated by the whole thing. And I went to my teacher, [[Narayan Helen Liebenson|Narayan]], at one point, and I explained this to her, what was going on for me. And she said, "Send them _[[Metta|mettā]]_. Send them lots of _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_." And then she said, "Not only that - wish them more SUVs." [laughs] I was like, "_Pff_, okay." [laughter] Actually, the second part of it, I couldn't do. It just seemed not possible and not even that wise, actually. But the first part was helpful. And what happened, what happened at some point was an [[insight]] arose, and a kind of coin dropped, and I realized that [[ignorance]], [[Avijja|delusion]] - these people were very nice (well, for the most part), very nice, lovely people just living their lives in the way that they thought was good. But there was, as I saw it at the time, <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span> about the consequences of choices like that. And that <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>, what the [[Buddha]] calls <span class="transcript"><a data-href="ignorance" href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span> or <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>, is [[Anatta|not-self]]. Again, it's _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_. In a way, it doesn't belong to anyone. So here was a particular instance of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>, which I was extracting out and then, "You are deluded. You. You. You." And just seeing: <span class="transcript"><a data-href="ignorance" href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span>, as a quality, is something we all share. We might differ in the way it manifests in our life, but <span class="transcript"><a data-href="ignorance" href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span> does not belong to self.

In blaming and pinpointing the [[ignorance]] and sticking the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="ignorance" href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span> to the person, the people, where's the [[compassion]]? The <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> actually cannot flow. So sometimes, just realizing that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="ignorance" href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span> doesn't belong to anyone - we all have <span class="transcript"><a data-href="ignorance" href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span> until we're Buddhas; it just comes out in different ways - allows the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to come in. Sometimes, when we're angry at people, "remaining" - [[Buddha]]'s words - "remaining percipient of what's beautiful," tuning into their good qualities.^[_Appaṭikūlasaññī vihareyyan_, "remain percipient of unloathsomeness," e.g. at MN 152, AN 5:144] So whoever it is, tuning into something that's lovely about them. Sometimes what we need to do, when the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is diverted into [[anger]], is actually redirect the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> towards ourselves - because when we're hardened in <span class="transcript"><a data-href="anger" href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, that's _[[dukkha]]_. That's [[Dukkha|suffering]]. So leave the other person, and just come back to yourself. Give the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to [[the self]], and the being, the heart, can soften and open. And then perhaps the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> can flow. When we're caught up in <span class="transcript"><a data-href="anger" href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, we are hurting. When we're caught up in blame and judgment, we are hurting. Sometimes we don't realize it.

Generally, this [[anger]], this second [[near enemy]] - [[compassion]] wants to alleviate [[Dukkha|suffering]], but it doesn't want to [[Aversion|push it away]] out of [[aversion]]. It's more that it holds <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. It embraces <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, holds it, accommodates it, and then adds [[healing]], and adds [[Insight|understanding]]. So it's not an aversive movement; it's a holding, and a bringing in of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="healing" href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> and <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>. It's subtle, but it's quite a different quality[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion holds suffering and then adds healing and understanding|.]] ^9-1
###### 9-2
**(3)** [[Fear]], [[anger]], **[[pity]]**. '[[Pity]],' in English, as opposed to '[[compassion]],' means when we look down at another: "Oh, poor them, [[Dukkha|suffering]] like that." And we feel above it in some way. Very interesting, this is - all these are going to creep into the practice. You'll be sitting here in the room, walking up and down, and you'll just notice, "Oh, look, I've just got a bit above the person. There's just a bit of looking down come in." Sometimes it's extremely obvious; sometimes it's very subtle. Again, it's okay. <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Pity" href="Pity" class="internal-link">Pity</a></span>'s an interesting one. It's disempowering. [[Compassion]] empowers; <span class="transcript"><a data-href="pity" href="pity" class="internal-link">pity</a></span> disempowers. So we can see for our self, when we <span class="transcript"><a data-href="pity" href="pity" class="internal-link">pity</a></span> ourselves, when we're caught in self-<span class="transcript"><a data-href="pity" href="pity" class="internal-link">pity</a></span>, it actually disempowers our self, disempowers our capacity to do anything and to move beyond the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. There's something almost draining and paralysing about <span class="transcript"><a data-href="pity" href="pity" class="internal-link">pity</a></span>. It keeps the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> there, whereas <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> moves it, heals it, dissolves it. So <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to self and other is empowering, not debilitating. This is very interesting[[Compassion (talk)#3 Pity|.]] ^9-2
###### 9-3
All these [[Near enemy|near enemies]], all of them, arise when there's too much [[The Self|self-view]]. So again, we're back to this _[[Anatta|anattā]]_ business. Too much <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" href="The+Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span> - when I'm too worried about myself in [[fear]], or too much defining [[the self]] of another in [[anger]], or [[pity]]: "They're like this. I'm like this." Or self-<span class="transcript"><a data-href="pity" href="pity" class="internal-link">pity</a></span>: "This is how I am. I'll always be like this," etc., "Terrible, poor me." Too much <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" href="The+Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span> of self and other comes in, and the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Near enemy" data-href="Near enemy" href="Near+enemy" class="internal-link">near enemies</a></span> come up. We can counter this in practice by contemplating or seeing the commonality. We see the commonality. One's sitting in practice, giving [[compassion]] to someone, and we feel a bit above them. Remind oneself of things that are common, human things. So instead of looking at the differences - "I don't really do that. I don't suffer like that," how easily that can come in - remind oneself of what's common, the common humanity in that moment[[Compassion (talk)#All these near enemies arise when there's too much self-view|.]] ^9-3
###### 9-4
**(4)** So [[fear]], [[anger]], [[pity]] - the last one is **[[grief]]**. And this is a very interesting one. Very easy when we're encountering [[Dukkha|suffering]], either our own or others', to be overwhelmed by it, to feel overwhelmed. And when the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="grief" href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span> comes up as a [[near enemy]] - which sometimes can be hard to tell the difference - again, it's debilitating. Long-term, it's actually tiring. [[Grief]] is an [[energy]] that's tiring. It's a complex one, because in many instances, we actually need to feel <span class="transcript"><a data-href="grief" href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>. It's part of a [[healing]] process. It's a necessary quality. But at a certain point, to begin to look into it and see, is it possible there's a mechanism here that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="grief" href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span> is actually spiralling and building? When there's <span class="transcript"><a data-href="grief" href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span> around, if it's <span class="transcript"><a data-href="grief" href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>, it will be tiring. That tiring, that [[tiredness]], it kind of makes the being, makes the heart, more vulnerable to more <span class="transcript"><a data-href="grief" href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>, which makes the heart _more_ tired. And it spirals on itself that way[[Compassion (talk)#4 Grief|.]] ^9-4
###### 9-5
Let's go into this a bit more. There are two aspects of [[compassion]] - this is a really, really important point now, and I'll probably repeat it anyway, but this is really, really important - there are two aspects of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> that need balancing. And we can talk about what I said, what I meant when I said "[[empathy]]." So that's one aspect: **(1) <span class="transcript"><a data-href="empathy" href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a></span>**. And the other aspect is **(2)** the **giving**. And I'll go into this[[Compassion (talk)#We need to balance empathy and giving|.]] ^9-5
###### 10-1
**(1)** So first of all, what is **[[empathy]]**? [[Empathy]] is this openness, this [[receptivity]], this resonance of the heart with the [[Dukkha|suffering]] of another, feeling moved, touched by the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of another. But there is a kind of, I would say - [[spaciousness]] and sweetness in it are marks of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="empathy" href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a></span>. So sometimes, we notice, we see the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of another, and somehow we've got sucked right into it, and we're just <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> the same as the other. So <span class="transcript"><a data-href="empathy" href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a></span> is a little bit different. It's a bit broader and more [[Spaciousness|spacious]], and it has a quality of sweetness. It's actually something very beautiful and attractive for the heart in the quality of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="empathy" href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a></span>[[Compassion (talk)#Spaciousness and sweetness are marks of 1 empathy|.]] ^10-1
###### 10-2
I have a family member who I know loves me very much, but sometimes when I have some difficulty going on or illness or whatever, there's something in her concern that's a bit too identified and too fearful, and it's almost that comes into the [[compassion]], and it becomes not helpful. It feels not helpful. It feels almost like a burden for the [[Dukkha|suffering]] person. You may know, you may have experienced this in your life[[Compassion (talk)#Story family member who is a bit too identified and fearful|.]] ^10-2
###### 10-3
But this [[empathy]] is something very beautiful, and a very lovely, precious quality of the heart. And we may feel, at times in our life, very drawn to opening this quality of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="empathy" href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a></span>. There's something - it's almost like we want to pry open the heart, pry open the being, and we want to take in the [[Dukkha|suffering]] in the world. I remember I'd just finished a year [[retreat]] here some years ago, and was having some time off, actually, before coming back again. And one of things I did was I took a train across Europe, and I went to Auschwitz [[Samadhi|concentration]] camp, extermination camp in fact. And it was sort of a bit of a pilgrimage. It was as if a part of my being wanted ... I felt - it was almost a mystery to me, in part, but a part of my being wanted to go to this place where there had been an _indescribable_ amount of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. I don't actually know the figures; I've forgotten how many million people died there or were killed there. And wanted to be there and just drink it all in. It's like the heart wanted to be wide and just drink it all in[[Compassion (talk)#Story Auschwitz|.]] ^10-3
###### 10-4
And actually being there - I don't know, some of you may have been - it's palpable somehow. A lot of the remains of the barracks and the gas chambers, etc., are still there. There's something palpable there. Something in the being wanted to drink it in. Just - this is the [[Dukkha|suffering]]. This is part of the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of the world. I just want to absorb it somehow. I think that's a beautiful movement, and a beautiful aspiration. At times in our life, we feel strong enough to do that; we feel open enough and [[Spaciousness|spacious]] to do that. But there's really an important balance here. [[Avalokiteshvara|Avalokiteśvara]] is the [[bodhisattva]] of [[compassion]], and one of the meanings of that is One Who Listens to the Cries of the World. Beautiful. One Who Listens to the Cries of the World. Receptive, hearing the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. It's a very receptive [[image]]. But the statue, the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="image" href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, the _[[Rupa|rūpa]]_ of it has - I don't know how many hands or arms - a lot[[Compassion (talk)#Wanting to take in all the suffering is a beautiful aspiration|.]] ^10-4
###### 10-5
**Yogi 3**: 1,000. ^10-5
###### 10-6
**Rob**: How many? 1,000 arms and hands. Why? To reach out, to give. So there's a balance of this **(1) [[empathy]]**, taking in, and **(2) giving out**. This is so, so important. We can actually address this in our practice. So you might have found today in the practice that you felt - I don't know, it's a question, actually: did you feel at times burdened, or like it was a bit heavy, or overwhelming? Yeah. Very, very common. Extremely common. It doesn't have to be this way. You can play with this. Again, you can experiment with this. We feel the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="empathy" href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a></span>. We're aware of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="empathy" href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a></span>, what we're taking in. We're tuning into the [[Dukkha|suffering]]. But also we're aware of this - even if we're just imagining it - a [[healing]] [[energy]] going out. And we imagine that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="energy" href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> flowing from our [[Embodiment|body]], etc. So there's something coming in and something going out[[Compassion (talk)#Balance this with a healing energy 2 giving out|.]] ^10-6
###### 11-1
Most people will - without even thinking about it, without even realizing it - lean the balance into more [[empathy]], into really going into the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="empathy" href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a></span>, and not so much into feeling the quality of the [[energy]] coming out: the [[healing]], [[Cultivation|nourishing]] brightness, actually happy <span class="transcript"><a data-href="energy" href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> of what's coming out. The thing is we can play with that balance in the practice. You can actually play with it as you're sitting there. Be aware of where the balance is, and just incline the [[mind]] more towards feeling the lovely <span class="transcript"><a data-href="healing" href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> <span class="transcript"><a data-href="energy" href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> as it's going out. So you can really play with this. It's not a static balance. In other words, you're not going to find, you know, stick the dial on 5 and leave it there. You'll always be moving, and it's fine to move. And sometimes you're more in the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="empathy" href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a></span> - fine. But I would say a little bit of balance towards the feeling of the loveliness and the [[happiness]] makes [[compassion]] enjoyable, sustainable, steady, equanimous, something that we like doing. And we need to kind of feel that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="energy" href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> in the [[Embodiment|body]], that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="energy" href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> going, or even just imagine it. And that's really, really going to help[[Compassion (talk)#You can play with this it's not a static balance|.]] ^11-1
###### 11-2
I'm not doing very well for time. There's a third aspect of [[compassion]], okay? So there's the [[empathy]], and there's the giving out. There's a third aspect, which at first is not so visible, but it makes itself more known over time. In a way, I'm giving a bit of an overview this evening. **(3)** The third aspect has to do with **[[spaciousness]]**, a quality of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="spaciousness" href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span> or an [[awareness]] of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="spaciousness" href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span>. It's as if the sense of the heart expands and _can_ expand so that it feels almost like it fills the space, or as if the [[Dukkha|suffering]] in the world is being held by a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> that, in a way, is part of the fabric of the universe. It's a kind of universal <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>[[Compassion (talk)#3 Spaciousness|.]] ^11-2
###### 11-3
So it moves, again, very non-linearly, very gradually. Begin to get glimpses of it, and it's not to make too much of this. We can sometimes get a sense of a [[compassion]] that it's not [[the self]] doing it. And it's almost like we open to some bigger sense of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, that the [[Dukkha|suffering]] in the world is _held -_ held, we could say, in the [[love]] of the universe, in the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> of the universe, in the heart of God, whatever language works. It's almost like something deepens, and the true [[nature]] of the heart is seen as not limited, but actually infinite and vast. And it can, it has limitless capacity to hold <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. And so this aspect of holding <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is very much a part of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> as it deepens. It just comes naturally. And a person might look at this in terms of God or the [[energy]] of a [[bodhisattva]] - it's all fine; it doesn't actually matter what label you give to it, to an extent. But we find that kind of opening, that kind of [[perception]] in a lot of different spiritual traditions. [[Julian of Norwich]], the English Christian mystic: "[[Love]] is without beginning," she says. "<span class="transcript"><a data-href="Love" href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a></span> is without beginning."^[Cf. Nicholas Watson and Jacqueline Jenkins, eds., _The Writings of Julian of Norwich: A Vision Showed to a Devout Woman and A Revelation of Love_ (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University, 2006), 197] It's the sense of a whole other, deeper sense of what <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is, and what <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is[[Compassion (talk)#We can get sometimes a sense of a compassion that it's not the self doing it|.]] ^11-3
###### 11-4
I'm going to skip a couple of bits and come to them in the instructions tomorrow morning. When we are [[Dukkha|suffering]] - [[compassion]] for self now - when we are <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> with whatever it is, it can be really helpful, it can be extremely skilful, whether it's loneliness or the [[Embodiment|body]] hurts or tummy ache, [[Pain|headache]], confusion, [[anxiety]], sadness, a sense of loss, of [[grief]], whatever the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is, when there's my <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and we're feeling it, to realize, to reflect deliberately: "My <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is actually not different from the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of others." quote So again, how easy it is for us to compound our own <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> with a sense of isolation. And thinking - sometimes it's not even a conscious thought: "It's just me that has this. I'm the one that goes through this. No one else has this." Sometimes it's not even a conscious thought, and we're adding, we're stacking on the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> by this isolating of ourselves[[Compassion (talk)#Reflect on that my suffering is actually not different from the suffering of others|.]] ^11-4
###### 12-1
So it can be - and again, something to play with - you can, when there's [[Dukkha|suffering]], just step back a little bit and deliberately reflect: "Someone, somewhere, probably even right now, is going through something extremely similar, something very similar if not almost exactly the same." Drop that in as a reflection. Sometimes our <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> - we feel our <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and we're actually unable to meet it with [[compassion]]. Partly this isolating of ourselves that we do is blocking the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. So dropping [in] this reflection, again, of the commonality of it, of the non-difference of our own <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, dropping that in, and we open to the humanity of our own <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. This is so crucial. And in that humanity, in the realization of the humanity, there's a kind of softening. And the being just softens. Instead of being rigidly, brittlely wrapped up in a kind of self-isolation, a self-definition and separateness, just dropping in the reflection of that commonness, that sharedness, the humanity, allows it to soften. And in the softening, there's an opening, and the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> can begin to flow. So play with this, play with this[[Compassion (talk)#In the realization of the humanity there's a kind of softening|.]] ^12-1
###### 12-2
As we move on to giving [[compassion]] to others and we do the friend and benefactor and all that, sometimes we want to give <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to someone. We look at them. We say, "Well, they don't seem to be [[Dukkha|suffering]] much. There's no obvious <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. They seem pretty okay. They're pretty happy." And then one can bring to [[mind]] the vulnerability of life. So we touched on this the other day. Just reminding oneself that life is vulnerable - on a physical level, at the emotional level, at a situational level. The uncertainty of life - what a challenge it is! Even if this person seems like they're doing really okay, it's basically challenging to be human. It's basically challenging to be human. It's not easy. It's not an easy manifestation. It's not an easy territory. So sometimes to reflect on that, if one feels like this person doesn't suffer much, just to lubricate it a little bit, bring the juice in. Also to reflect, "I actually don't know. Even if I know this person well, I may not know really what's going on for them, and what possible <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> there may be there. I don't know. I don't know.[[Compassion (talk)#Remind yourself that life is vulnerable|"]] ^12-2
###### 12-3
One can also reflect on this [[oneness]], and begin to incline the heart and incline the [[mind]] towards <span class="transcript"><a data-href="oneness" href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>. We are one. You know, at some level, we are one - in this vulnerability, this physical vulnerability that we have. This [[Embodiment|body]] can get injured at any time. It can get sick very easily. The <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> is vulnerable. We are vulnerable to [[death]]. Reflecting, we are one in that. We share that. There's a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="oneness" href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> there. We are one in our uncertainty. Again, we're living in a world where things are uncertain. What happens, what will happen tomorrow, is uncertain. What will happen in the next year, for all of us, is uncertain. It's not certain at all. And probably we all know people whose life can be changed in an instant. Something happens - a piece of news, an accident, this or that - and the life is changed in an instant, dramatically, drastically. We share that. We are one in the vulnerability of that uncertainty[[Compassion (talk)#Incline the mind towards oneness|.]] ^12-3
###### 12-4
We're also one in our bewilderment with all of this. So this is what the [[Buddha]] talks about. It's fundamental [[Avijja|delusion]]. Life - we don't have it sussed yet. We don't have it figured out until we're completely Buddhas. We share that _[[Ignorance|avijjā]]_, that <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>, that bewilderment. And to extents, we all go looking for [[happiness]], [[Pleasantness|well-being]], security in places that don't bring it. We share that. We share that bewilderment. We're one in that. So the more we contemplate this [[oneness]] and bring it in, the more the [[compassion]] can flow[[Compassion (talk)#We share that avijja that bewilderment|.]] ^12-4

There's a beautiful poem by - she's actually a Palestinian American poet called [[Naomi Shihab Nye]]. It's actually called "[[Metta|Kindness]]." Some of you may know it.

So contemplating that [[oneness]]. Final point, and it has to do with this _[[Anatta|anattā]]_ and this [[emptiness]]. We talk about _<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_, the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="emptiness" href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of self. We could also talk about - looking at it from another point of view - the _infinite_ [[nature]] of [[the self]], [[Infinity|the infinite]] <span class="transcript"><a data-href="nature" href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of a person. So I think we've touched on this already. I can't remember. This [[Embodiment|body]] - where did it come from? I saw a great programme the other night about comets landing on the planet and how life actually was started by the elements that were brought from comets. Was either coming from comets or [[Big Bang]] - not <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Big Bang" href="Big+Bang" class="internal-link">Big Bang</a></span>, but some [[supernova]] of other stars. Now, all this can sound kind of sci-fi, but it's actually science, that this <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> is coming - the elements in it come from elements that were generated in massive stars, and then those stars exploded and flung out these elements into space. And all the elements that make up our fingernails and our cornea and whatever it is - everyone in this room, the elements that made that were born in the same star. I think it's amazing! [laughter] ^13-3

Going back even further, even further, it was all one in the [[Big Bang]], that the universe was actually tiny, shrunk into this little ball. The whole of space and time was encapsulated there, and it exploded. It was all literally one. Everything that was in the universe was literally one. But - I think I did mention this at some point - the [[breath]] we take, we are permeable with the rest, certainly the earth. We breathe in air. When does it become 'me'? And breathe out. And we share the air with each other and with the trees and with the rest of life, and with the planet. There's this permeability of what I call 'me,' just on a bodily level. And the food - I think, is it [[Stephen Batchelor]]'s example (can't remember) of eating a banana? It's something very mushy. Or porridge - that's another example. It's mushy. At what point does the porridge become _me_? You understand? It's going ... [laughter] ^13-4

[[Walt Whitman]] - I think it's from "Song of Myself." It's a long, long mystical poem of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Walt Whitman" href="Walt+Whitman" class="internal-link">Walt Whitman</a></span>, 1855: ^13-5

Lovely. That's what he's talking about. You know, where did he get it from, 1855? Joni Mitchell - some of you are old enough to remember. [laughter] "We are stardust."^[From Joni Mitchell's 1970 song "Woodstock."] Bodily level[[Compassion (talk)#"We are stardust"|.]] ^13-7

The other day I talked about, at the level of [[consciousness]], that all I can see when I look inside is [[Perception|perceptions]], <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>, <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>. Those <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span> - look, here's the radiator, here's the wall - all I can see is <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>. Is the [[perception]] _me_, or is it out there? There's a non-separateness of self and world because <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> is a double-sided feature. I need the world to see myself, because when I see, all I see is <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. When I look inside for a self, all I see is <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>. To have a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, I need the rest of the universe to perceive. So we can talk about [[emptiness]]. We can also say <span class="transcript"><a data-href="emptiness" href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> is fullness: _this_ is _full_ of everything. This being, these beings, this self is _full_ of the universe. The [[mind]] and the [[Embodiment|body]] (we'll have questions after) - not separate, not separate. So it's just another [[Ways of looking|way of seeing]] it[[Compassion (talk)#Perception is a double-sided feature|.]] ^13-8

Interpenetrating - so 'interconnectedness' is a word that's used a lot in the [[Dharma]], but in a way, it doesn't go deep enough. Interpenetrating. Literally things, cells, beings - all things are interpenetrating. Now, we can hear this, and I'm well aware, we can hear this, and either it sounds like an extremely dated hippie concept hung over from the sixties or just some kind of intellectual, you know, if you're at a cocktail party and you can't think what to say, you bring this up to amuse someone. It doesn't have to be just a nice idea or something intellectual. Again, it's something that we can bring into the practice. You can actually be in the practice, doing the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ or the [[compassion]] - bring this in. Think about Big Bangs, and think about stardust and the way the [[breath]] is permeable. Bring it in, and see what happens. It needs practice, but it will lead to [[love]] and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>[[Compassion (talk)#Interpenetrating|.]] ^14-1
