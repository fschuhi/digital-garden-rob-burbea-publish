Settling again into a posture of ease, a posture of uprightness, openness. Just connecting with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of the body</a></span>. Establishing that open sensitivity to the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. And when you feel ready, bringing into the heart, bringing into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> and the sense of the benefactor. And just reflecting for a few moments on what you have received from the benefactor and their obvious <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>, whether it's large or small. Just remembering and tuning into the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Blessing" data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">gifts</a></span> you have received from them, whatever they are. And at the same time, opening the heart, tuning in, to be sensitive to their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, their measure of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, their difficulties. Just open to their <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> and sorrow, such as it is. Just wishing: "May they be free of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. May they be at peace.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion > Compassion to benefactor" data-href="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion#Compassion to benefactor" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^1-2

Letting the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> open up and just remembering, reflecting on others, many others, perhaps, who have shown you <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span> at some time in your life or given you <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>. Who have cared for you in different ways. Who have helped you, who have given of their time. And with each, again just opening up also to their sorrow, their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, their sense of difficulty and challenge. Allowing that sensitivity in the heart. And wishing each one: "May you be free from <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. May you be at peace." Bathing them, holding them in the care, the tenderness of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion > Compassion to those to whom you are grateful" data-href="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion#Compassion to those to whom you are grateful" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3

Reflecting on the different kinds of beings: all the beings that we have received from, do receive from, will receive from in this life. How much we have received from our teachers. Just bringing to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, bringing into the heart the spiritual teachers we've had or we have, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma teachers</a></span>. Sharing their <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span>, sharing their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, giving generously. Just opening to the sense of receiving from them, of what has been received. Their courage, their goodness, their truth. Allowing the heart again also to open to, to be sensitive to their challenges, their difficulties, their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> and sorrow in this life. Just tuning in sensitively there, open, receptive. Allowing them to be held in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. "May you be free from <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. May you be at peace." And likewise, too, the teachers who taught us in school. Despite all the mixed <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span> we might have about school. Those who taught us to read, with patience taught us to write. These skills we use every day with numbers, with language, with knowledge. Take these for granted, but it has helped us to express and to navigate in the world. Just remembering the teachers who have helped us in this way. All that has been received. Aware, too, now, of their <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, of their sorrow, their struggle. "May they be free from <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. May they be at peace.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion > Compassion to those from whom we have received" data-href="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion#Compassion to those from whom we have received" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^1-4

Bringing into the heart the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>, the sense of your parents. Just allowing them to be there in the openness, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span> of the heart. Despite all the complexity that can be there in these <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span>, despite the difficulty that can be there in these <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span>, just reflecting on how much has been received. How they fed us when we were young, how they clothed us, housed us, nursed us when we were sick or injured, provided us with a sense of security. How they even cleaned us when we were unable to clean ourselves, our bodies. Just opening up the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> to the huge stream of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="generosity" class="internal-link">generosity</a></span>, of care that we have received from our parents. Allowing the heart to open, too, to their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, their <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, their confusion. Wherever they are now, "May they be free from <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. May they be at peace.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion > Compassion to the parents" data-href="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion#Compassion to the parents" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^1-5

And allowing yourself to recall, to recollect the friends that you have had over the years: friends, partners, boyfriends, girlfriends. All the different friends and what has been received in friendship. And what has been shared and the opportunities of sharing. Learning to share, learning intimacy. Feeling the gift of all that. The preciousness, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> of all that. They, too, with their struggles, their confusion, their anxieties, and their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>. "May they be free from <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. May they be at peace.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion > Compassion to friends" data-href="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion#Compassion to friends" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^2-1

Opening the heart, opening the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> to include, to reflect on the countless beings that we don't know, that we have never known, from whom we have received. Inventors, people who discover, scientists, people who have worked, who have invented or tried to discover, who have given us a whole range of what helps us today. The kinds of tools that make our life safer, easier; medicine. The artists throughout <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span>, from whom we've received cultural <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Blessing" data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">gifts</a></span>, books, literature, all the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> that exists - the evolution of that art over time. Painting and sculpture. Reflecting on their care, their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, and their effort in their work. Just sensitive, tuning into their struggles, their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>. Holding them in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, allowing them to be held in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion > Compassion to investors and artists" data-href="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion#Compassion to investors and artists" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
Reflecting, too, on the countless numbers of people we don't know, beings we don't know involved in the web of trade and cooperation, of business and distribution of goods. From whom we are receiving every day, every day of our lives. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Nourishing</a></span> and sustaining us. Each with their own <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, their own <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, their own confusion. Holding them in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, embracing them, wrapping them in that tenderness and that care. "May you be free from <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. May you be at peace." The whole sense of that unentangleable web of human endeavour throughout <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span>. People learning from each other, trading from each other. How much this life of ours now, this moment of our life now is receiving from that river. Going back and back<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion > Compassion to business people" data-href="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion#Compassion to business people" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
Bringing into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> a difficult person. A person with whom there is some difficulty, or people with whom there has been some difficulty. Reflecting how the challenge there has helped us to grow, does help us to grow, to develop patience, to develop <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and even in this difficulty there is a gift that we receive. So it's been so throughout our life, and it is so now. Opening, tuning into their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, their sorrow. "May you be free from <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. May you be at peace.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion > Compassion to a difficult person" data-href="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion#Compassion to a difficult person" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^2-4
###### 2-5
Opening the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> up, opening the heart up to all the animals, the fish, the birds, what we receive from them in so many ways on this earth. Their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>, and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Beauty" data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">sense of beauty</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a></span>, the vast diversity of creatures, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a></span> in that. Opening up to what we receive from the whole ecosystem, the whole fragile interconnectedness of our ecosystem. Just how we receive and receive and receive. Plant life, tree life, vegetable life. The colours. Sustaining us, sustaining each other, sustaining the ecosystem. Providing oxygen. Providing shelter. Aware of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> there. Holding it all in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Allowing it to be held in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Realizing, reflecting: nothing, absolutely nothing is outside this web, this infinite web. Sustaining us, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a></span> us, giving to us. And that we too are part of that web. Sensitive to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. Letting it be held in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And just allowing a sense of space to open up. And allowing the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> to just radiate out <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> in space, filling space, all space, all directions. Filling it with that tenderness, with that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span>. Holding all things in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion > Compassion to all animals and plant life" data-href="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion#Compassion to all animals and plant life" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-5

###### 3-2
So today we are moving on to include all beings in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Again, like when we did the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, there's a number of ways of doing it. Just to refresh - you can do it in terms of categories of beings, so humans or this type of human, or that type of human, different types of animals, etc. You can do it in terms of directions. So all beings to the north, to the south, to the west, the east, etc. Or you could also do this just <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of the body</a></span> in space radiating <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, which I think is the simplest and the easiest and the most also conducive to _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_. But it's very personal, so just feel free to experiment and see which is best for you. If the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ feels strong enough or there's a sense of settledness in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and the heart with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, it can be almost, at times, as if the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> has _turned into_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And you just let yourself _be_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and just radiate that out. Let everything become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. It's just radiating out<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion > Compassion according to categories of being or directions or just the sense of the body radiating compassion" data-href="Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion#Compassion according to categories of being or directions or just the sense of the body radiating compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2

I think that's it. There's no talk tonight. There'll be a talk tomorrow. So this is the last day of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Again, don't worry if you haven't got to certain people. There will be an option to continue doing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice next week, as part of what we do next week. Tomorrow, going to introduce something new, so just enjoy the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> for today. Okay? ^3-3
