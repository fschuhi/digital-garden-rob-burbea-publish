[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves]]

###### 1-1
I was perhaps a little even more long-winded than usual last night, and as a result there were a couple of things I left out, which I just want to touch on today. Today we add [[the self]], [[compassion]] to <span class="transcript"><a data-href="the self" href="the+self" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the self</a></span>. So we keep <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> to the person who is obviously [[Dukkha|suffering]], and we add <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> to <span class="transcript"><a data-href="the self" href="the+self" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the self</a></span>. I'm going to speak a bit about that, which should have gone in the talk last night had I not been so long-winded. Actually, there's an old Jewish proverb that says, "Why say something in twenty words when you can say it in two thousand?" [laughter] ^1-1
###### 1-2
When we move on to [[compassion]] for [[the self]], very, very common, this is very common: we've just been with someone obviously [[Dukkha|suffering]], and the feeling that comes up or the reaction that comes up, and it's understandable, can be, "But I look at myself, and I just see others in the world are <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span> much more. I'm aware of my <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span>, but when I compare that to the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span> that I know of in the world, that I read about, that I hear about, it seems unfair to stay with myself and give the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> to myself." This is extremely common[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#"It seems unfair to give compassion to myself others suffer much more!"|.]] ^1-2
###### 1-3
I remember taking a month with some [[Dharma]] friends, and working at a leprosy community in India, and having a long conversation on the long train trip down from Delhi with a friend. And she had done a lot of service work from a very young age, and was sort of saying that service was really much more needed in the Third World, etc., and it was pointless relating to sort of white middle-class people in the West, etc. But we had a long conversation, and then going to this leprosy community and actually seeing how much [[Happiness|joy]] there was there - it was quite striking. People with leprosy, and recovering from leprosy, or having recovered from leprosy - a tremendous amount of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" href="Happiness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joy</a></span> there. And we had this sort of ongoing conversation and comparing that to some of the [[Dukkha|suffering]] that's around in the West. I really don't want to polarize East and West here, but sometimes where we think the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span> is isn't always where it is, in the most obvious sense. And anyway, <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span> is not measurable. This is something we'll come back to. But <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span> is not measurable[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Story leprosy community in Indea|.]] ^1-3
###### 1-4
But this reaction, "Others suffer much more" - extremely common. Sometimes it's just a habitual way of viewing, a habitual [[Ways of looking|way of seeing]] ourselves and thinking. There's something - well, there are a lot of things really crucial about [[compassion]] to [[the self]]. One of them is that this [[Dukkha|suffering]] here is the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span> that we can be most intimate with. And because of that, there's the potential that we can actually learn most from it, in terms of, how does <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span> arise? Remember, that's the fundamental question of [[insight]], of _paññā_, of [[Insight|wisdom]]. So because we're most intimate with this psychophysical organism, that's where we learn the most. And that <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wisdom</a></span> then translates and transfers into <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> for others, because we understand the roots of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span>. The more we understand the roots of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span>, the more <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> there can be for all beings[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#This suffering here is the one we can be most intimate with|.]] ^1-4

[[Compassion]] for oneself - tremendously [[healing]]. Really, really important levels of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="healing" href="healing" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healing</a></span> there. And it comes in lots of different ways. It comes, of course, through _[[Metta|mettā]]_ to ourselves, through [[compassion]] to ourselves, but also through the _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_, to whatever extent it's there. Just the calming of the [[Embodiment|body]], the calming of the [[mind]], brings a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="healing" href="healing" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healing</a></span>. I can actually feel a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="healing" href="healing" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healing</a></span> going on sometimes. And also through [[insight]], as I just said[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Compassion for oneself is tremendously healing|.]] ^1-5
###### 2-1
So this practice of [[compassion]] and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> to oneself - you can actually enjoy it. And like I said last night, it doesn't have to be always heavy. Sometimes it feels, you know, the heart is reverberating with [[empathy]], and it can feel - not heavy, but just poignant, definitely. But there's also an [[Pleasantness|enjoyment]] in <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> practice that's available. And that <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enjoyment</a></span> is very much part of the [[healing]], as much as the being moved and the being touched[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#There's also enjoyment in compassion practice|.]] ^2-1
###### 2-2
This aspect, and I mentioned it, I think - well, definitely last night, and maybe even before - this balancing of the [[empathy]] and the giving, this is so important. Do I need to go over it again? I'm really happy to explain it again if people are not quite sure what that means yet[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Balance of empathy and giving is so important|.]] ^2-2
###### 2-3
**Yogi**: Could you explain the difference between [[empathy]] and sympathy? Because I get those muddled. ^2-3
###### 2-4
**Rob**: I'm not sure I know. ^2-4
###### 2-5
**Yogi 2**: Think sympathy's got a bit of [[pity]] with it. ^2-5
###### 2-6
**Rob**: Okay, maybe that's right. Thank you, Frances. Maybe in English usage of the word 'sympathy' has come to mean something which evokes a sense of [[pity]], which has a sense of distance and somewhat looking down. I don't know whether it originally meant that. Just, you know, 'sym-pathy' - it doesn't imply that. But it's probably come to have been injected a little bit with that[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#"Sympathy" in English has connotations of pity|.]] ^2-6
###### 2-7
**Yogi 3**: I was wondering about our look at this word '[[pity]],' whether that's something to do with a Western approach rather than the original maybe biblical terms. May have _been_ [[compassion]], but we've interpreted it as something from a distance, you know, something we look at from a distance[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Biblical origin of "pity"|.]] ^2-7
###### 2-8
**Rob**: Yeah, very possibly. Yeah, and probably originally the word meant something much more like [[compassion]]. But that feeling might still have arisen for people. And so I just want to use words to separate out what one might notice in one's practice when one's a bit distant, a bit aloof, a bit almost superior[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#"Pity" points to being a bit distant aloof|.]] ^2-8
###### 2-9
But this piece about balancing our [[empathy]], how we're resonating, how we're feeling the [[Dukkha|suffering]], opening to it, taking it in, and balancing that with the giving out. And tasting, feeling in the [[Embodiment|body]] the loveliness of what we give out as a way of making the [[compassion]] sustainable[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Feeling in the body the loveliness of giving is a way to make the compassion sustainable|.]] ^2-9
###### 2-10
When we come to [[compassion]] for our self, in a way, this balance and this process still applies. Usually in [[insight]] practice, when we have a [[pain]] - emotional or physical or mental, whatever it is - the instructions, part of the instructions, are to really go into the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="pain" href="pain" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pain</a></span>, and really feel it in a very bare way, open oneself to it, get into the texture of it, be right there with it. And so, quite standard [[Meditation|insight meditation]] instructions - very useful, very powerful, very beautiful. Slightly different emphasis with <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> to oneself, in that one is aware of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="pain" href="pain" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pain</a></span>, whatever it is - emotional hurt, physical <span class="transcript"><a data-href="pain" href="pain" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pain</a></span>, whatever - but it's almost as if that's at the [[centre]] of something. And one is conscious of it. One's feeling it. One's even feeling the [[Dukkha|suffering]] of it. But in a way, one's more interested in what's _around_ that, in the - someone in their note, beautifully put - the _holding_ that goes _around_ the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="pain" href="pain" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pain</a></span>. So it's as if this <span class="transcript"><a data-href="pain" href="pain" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pain</a></span> is at the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="centre" href="centre" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">centre</a></span>. And we're not denying it. We're still feeling it, but we're not going right into it. We're more interested in the warmth and the tenderness and the holding that's around it. And the [[attention]] is a little bit more even in that. So it's, again, picking up on this quality of what's bathing, what's giving, what's going out[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Different from insight practice in compassion practice one is more interest in what is around the pain not in the center of it|.]] ^2-10
###### 3-1
Another issue that can come up when we give either _[[Metta|mettā]]_ or [[compassion]] to myself is the question, "Am I feeding my ego? If I spend too long just relating to myself with [[love]] and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span>, am I perhaps feeding the ego and feeding this [[The Self|sense of self]]?" Good question. But when we look carefully, we actually see that the ego-sense is dependent on the _wrong_ kind of [[attention]] to [[the self]] - on an obsession, or judgmentalism, or criticism, or that kind of thing. A wrong kind of self-<span class="transcript"><a data-href="attention" href="attention" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attention</a></span> feeds, builds the ego and builds <span class="transcript"><a data-href="the self" href="the+self" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the self</a></span>-sense, whereas an <span class="transcript"><a data-href="attention" href="attention" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attention</a></span> that's full of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span>, full of tenderness, full of [[acceptance]] and care, full of [[insight]] into questioning, "How is it that this [[Dukkha|suffering]] has come about?" - that kind of direction of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="attention" href="attention" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attention</a></span> towards self does not build the ego, will not build the ego, will actually soften things, will actually allow things to become looser and more [[Spaciousness|spacious]][[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Compassion to self does not build the ego|.]] ^3-1
###### 3-2
And as I said before, when there's a lack of [[Love|self-love]], we tend to look out for [[Cultivation|nourishment]]. We look outwards, in a way, too much, in an off-balance way. And somehow that actually _also_ feeds [[the self]]. So there's a basic practice for [[compassion]] to oneself: just using the phrases, using the intention, feeling that [[energy]]. And just a word here in response to someone's note, actually, to repeat something I said: <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span>, I feel - not everyone will feel this, but some people will definitely feel this - <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> is a lighter <span class="transcript"><a data-href="energy" href="energy" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy</a></span>. It _can_ be a little more subtle. So what that might mean is you might want to really back off on the phrases. Some people don't want to use any phrases at all with <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span>, because it's more delicate. Some people just use the phrases much more lightly, and this allows the sense of drawing close to the [[Dukkha|suffering]], of [[empathy]], and also of giving. So play with that. Play with how heavily and tightly you hold the phrases[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Compassion is a lighter energy than metta so phrases can be used more lightly|.]] ^3-2
###### 3-3
Okay, so there's the basic practice of [[compassion]] to oneself and all the lovely [[healing]], the [[beauty]] of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="healing" href="healing" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healing</a></span> that's involved in that. There are two more possibilities I just want to put out there. Again, some of you will be interested, and some, it's fine to just let these go. But I want to put them out[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Two more possibilities|.]] ^3-3
###### 3-4
**(1)** Sometimes we're directing the [[compassion]] towards our self, and we're actually not feeling much [[Dukkha|suffering]] in that moment. There's nothing particularly dramatic going on. There's no big <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span> in the here and now. But **because of the practice, there can be a _climate_ of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span>**. It's as if there's a softness and tenderness come into the inner climate, and some degree of _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_, of settling - it doesn't have to be a big deal - some degree of settling. And perhaps one's gone down to one word or one phrase and just really simplified and lightened the practice. There's no particular, dramatic <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span>, but something quite powerful is potentially possible here. You can **use that whole climate and the practice as a kind of lens to look at one's [[experience]] in the moment, and to see any kind of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span>, any kind of subtle <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span>, and to unhook it**[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#1 Use the climate of compassion as a lense|.]] ^3-4
###### 3-5
So one's actually using a kind of [[insight]] practice through the lens of [[compassion]], in a way that the lens of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> is tuning one into any subtle manifestation of [[Dukkha|suffering]]. And what can happen because of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> is one sees these subtle sufferings, and it just unhooks organically. One sees what one's doing, what one's [[clinging]] to right there and then, and it just can unhook it - because there's this attunement to <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span>, because of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> practice. And there's a natural [[letting go]], can be a natural <span class="transcript"><a data-href="letting go" href="letting+go" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letting go</a></span>[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#The lens of compassion is used to tune into any subtle manifestation of suffering|.]] ^3-5
###### 4-1
This can be a very, very beautiful and powerful way of practising. It tends to kind of consolidate whatever [[Insight|insights]] we've already had. So one might have - I mean, it can be anything - just the [[insight]] that when I get too involved in story, and I build up my [[Dukkha|suffering]] through the story, I'm actually creating more <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span>. We've all seen how [[consciousness]] can do that. We get too - we drag in the past and the future and the story, and we build <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span>. So in this climate of [[compassion]], relatively calm, one sees the beginnings of that. And somehow in the seeing and the softness, it just unhooks. It just unhooks[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Somehow in the seeing and the softness it just unhooks|.]] ^4-1
###### 4-2
It consolidates our previous [[Insight|insights]] of seeing that story-building is _usually_, not always, but usually unhelpful. Or could be just we sense we've moved out of the here and now, we've moved out of an immediate presence. So in this way of using [[compassion]] practice, there's a bit more openness to what's actually going on in the moment. It's not just tunnelled into the phrases in the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span>. It's a bit more open, and the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> is embracing the [[experience]] in the moment. Could be we just sense we've closed down, the heart's just closed, and we don't need to. And again, the climate allows it to open. Or we feel we're [[Craving|grasping]] at something. And we're just aware of the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" href="Craving" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grasping</a></span>. And again, the lens of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> sees it and can just let it go. But it can be any range of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insights</a></span>. Identification - we see that we're identified with something. If one has the practice, we see, "Ah, I'm not seeing the [[emptiness]] of something. I'm believing in something's inherent existence, whatever it is" - can be a whole range of subtlety here. It's all there, possible[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#This way there is a bit more openness in the compassion practice|.]] ^4-2
###### 4-3
So again, just putting this out as a possibility. As a way of practice, it's actually a very beautiful kind of mix of [[insight]] practice and [[compassion]] practice, very lovely way to go about doing <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span> practice, and a way of deepening and expanding the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> practice[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Beautiful mix of insight and compassion practice|.]] ^4-3
###### 4-4
**(2)** Second possibility - and it's just a possibility - giving the [[compassion]] to [[the self]], and as the calming deepens or in moments of [[Steadiness|calmness]], we look inside at what we're giving the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> to, and it can sometimes seem, or sometimes becomes clear, that this is really **<span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> to [[mind]] moments**. So when I give <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> to myself and there's [[Dukkha|suffering]] - big <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span> or little <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span> - what I'm really encountering is moments of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mind" href="mind" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mind</a></span>, moments of [[awareness]] with something going on in them. Not a self - I don't ever encounter a self. What I encounter is moments of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mind" href="mind" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mind</a></span> with something happening in that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mind" href="mind" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mind</a></span> moment, moments of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="awareness" href="awareness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awareness</a></span>. Or you could say <span class="transcript"><a data-href="the self" href="the+self" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the self</a></span> that I encounter is just really <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mind" href="mind" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mind</a></span> moments. It's just <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mind" href="mind" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mind</a></span> moments[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#2 Compassion to self is compassion to mind moments|.]] ^4-4
###### 4-5
What this can do, what it _does_ do when we see this, is it frees up the [[The Self|sense of self]]. Again, instead of a solid <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" href="The+Self" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sense of self</a></span> - my independent, fixed, solid self - it frees it up in a way that's very [[Spaciousness|spacious]], can be very <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spacious</a></span>. And in so doing, it frees up more [[compassion]]. The more <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spacious</a></span> this <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" href="The+Self" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sense of self</a></span>, the more <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span>. And once we've seen that in ourselves, we can actually do that to another. So we're giving <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> to someone else. Who am I giving <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> to? There's no one there. It's just [[mind]] moments, with something happening in the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mind" href="mind" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mind</a></span> moment[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#This frees up the sense of self which frees up more compassion|.]] ^4-5
###### 4-6
So in a way, we're giving [[compassion]] to ownerless [[mind]] moments, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mind" href="mind" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mind</a></span> moments that have no owner. This is another way into the _[[Anatta|anattā]]_, this <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" href="Anatta" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not-self</a></span> business. And the paradox is there: the less the receiver of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span>, and the less the giver of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span>, the more <span class="transcript"><a data-href="compassion" href="compassion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compassion</a></span> there is.

But these are just suggestions, and take them on if you want to explore. By all means, take them on if they feel useful. Otherwise just let them go. File them for another time, whatever. It's fine. The [[Buddha]] has a phrase: "If you're digging for water, if you want to dig a well for water, dig one hole and dig it deep. Don't dig lots of little holes - you're not going to get enough." So the same with all these possibilities. Just take one or two things that seem, "Ah yeah, maybe I can work with that," and dig deep with them. See what happens. Keep the rest for another time[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#"If you want to dig a well for water dig one hole and dig it deep|.]] ^5-1
