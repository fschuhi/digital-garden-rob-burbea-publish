###### 1-1
What I want to talk about tonight is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of things</a></span>. But first, in a way, I want to review some of the salient features of what we've been doing so far. So at a very basic level, of course, we've been, we _are_ cultivating _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, cultivating <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, and cultivating <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And I don't think that I need to persuade anyone of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Blessing" data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">blessings</a></span> of that at this point on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. And so we see, through the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Blessing" data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">blessings</a></span> of doing this that come for self and for other. And if it's not clear yet what comes out towards other, it does get clear as we move into our life, our usual life<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Cultivating loving-kindness and compassion brings blessings for self and for other" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Cultivating loving-kindness and compassion brings blessings for self and for other" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1

So to repeat the analogy that I've used many times, we're planting these seeds, planting the seeds of intention. And we're <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a></span> the heart and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, which essentially, you could say, is a whirlpool, a web of conditioning, of conditions and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span> of conditions. And we're <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a></span> it slowly, patiently, gradually, and in that, through that, transforming the heart, transforming our intentions, so that the way we act in the world, what comes out of our mouth, our thoughts, all of that, is gradually, slowly transformed. Remember the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s words: "Drop by drop the bucket is filled."^[Dhp 122] That's a very basic level of what we're doing<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Planting the seeds of intention to recondition the mind" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Planting the seeds of intention to recondition the mind" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2
###### 1-3
Another aspect, or rather part of that, is that through cultivating <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, we're also nurturing and establishing the best possible climate for our growth: so psychological, emotional, spiritual growth. It's the best possible climate. And I know, if I reflect back on my past, trying at times to work very hard on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> myself or on transforming myself, and yet not holding that process, not holding myself in that process in a climate of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>. I was barely aware of it at the time. And what happens? Just running into a brick wall. Or it backfires in some way. And maybe there's some transformation. But the fullness of that will not be available. And so whatever growth we're talking about - meditative, spiritual, however - the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> are the best possible climate<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > We are nurturing the best possible climate for our growth" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#We are nurturing the best possible climate for our growth" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3

When the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> described his path, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> that he set forth, it's interesting - he didn't teach that much about technique and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> technique. There's a little bit, but it's not generally that common. Rather, what he does over and over is encourage us to strive for two things, to work to develop two things. **(1)** One is a **<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span>**, a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> sense of the being, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, the heart, being nourished. And '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span>' meaning ways that don't lead to our harm or the harm of others. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">Wholesome</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span> - so what's in that? It's all these qualities: <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="generosity" class="internal-link">generosity</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, etc., <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>. And developing these qualities that give the being a really deep, really satisfying grounding in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span>. It's like there's a reservoir inside. Slowly, slowly, there's a reservoir inside. And that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span> is one aspect of what he encouraged. **(2)** And the other aspect is **investigation for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>**. And these two kind of wings of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>: developing what's beautiful for the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span>, and then the investigation<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Two wings for the path wholesome nourishment and investigation for insight" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Two wings for the path wholesome nourishment and investigation for insight" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4

So, in a way, the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ is, again, part of that very deep <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span>. And the more we have of that, in a way, the freer we are in life. We are less dependent on others, less dependent on circumstances. We have enough. We have enough, and it's not cold. It's not uncaring or isolationist. It's just that we have enough, and it can flow over. Part of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span> is _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_. So for me - I don't know how it seems for you - it seems like a long time ago that I spoke about _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_. But I was hoping, talking about it at the beginning, that it would be something that we would keep in our minds, in the sort of back of our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> for the whole <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. And it's interesting: we come here for three weeks or longer, or whatever it is, and a lot of stuff happens. A lot of stuff happens in our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. We go through a lot of stuff. There are a lot of aspects to what we're doing. We talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> - there are a lot of aspects to that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Wholesome nourishment through metta and samadhi" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Wholesome nourishment through metta and samadhi" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-5
###### 2-1
One aspect, and I've talked on this, is questioning. So we question: "What is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, actually, when I really look at it? How is that different from, say, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pity" class="internal-link">pity</a></span> or whatever else? What is my attitude towards that? What blocks it?", etc. So there's a real questioning going on. That's very much a part of what's going on. And at times, as you all know, things come up for us. We find ourself in difficult territory, old <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span> come up, or just <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span> in the moment come up. We're struggling. Or it's just something charged, not even that much struggle. That, too, is part of the process. So there's the questioning. There is allowing ourselves to feel what needs to be felt at times, feeling the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Questioning" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Questioning" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
_And_ there's the encouragement, the nurturing, of the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_, which is actually a quietening of the questioning and a quietening of the turbulence of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span>, which sometimes seem like they really _demand_ to be felt, _demand_ to be looked at. So all that somehow needs to fit into the picture of what we're doing. Sometimes we're more questioning, sometimes we're more allowing what needs to bubble up, and sometimes we're just developing the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ and letting things get quiet, developing that journey into the depth, into the stillness, into the subtlety<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Encouragement" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Encouragement" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
Now what I see - and this is kind of reviewing a bit what I said about _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ - is that most people that I come across in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> circles tend not to give as much emphasis or believe as much in the importance of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ as perhaps they should. It's almost like we don't quite trust that or give it as much weight. And so partly - I'm just refreshing - that's definitely a factor here for the depth and the depth of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, the depth of opening, the depth of transformation, as I said. _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a></span>_ is one of the factors. It's just one. So all the others are important. But it's one of the factors that allows the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to kind of come into the cells. Something very visceral almost about it, very deep. But again, they're all important. All those aspects are important. To know what one's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">tendencies</a></span> are. Is my tendency to avoid? What is it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Samadhi is one of the factors that allows the love and compassion to come into the cells" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Samadhi is one of the factors that allows the love and compassion to come into the cells" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
So there's this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, and we're kind of developing both in a lifetime of practice. With the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a></span> of qualities that bring <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span> (one of which is _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_, and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, etc.), very important to see that it's not about self-improvement. And how easily the judging <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> comes in, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind" data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">measuring mind</a></span> comes in: "How am I doing?" And particularly with concepts like _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ or _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, whatever it is: "I have it. I don't have it. How am I in relation to others?" So it's really not about self-improvement, and the whole notion of a self to improve begins to just loosen in time with practice. And yet, we can still be really committed to this process of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a></span>, of developing the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span>, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a></span>. And yet there's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">no self</a></span> at the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> of it. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">No self</a></span> at the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> of it, and yet we're totally committed<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Cultivation is not about self-improvement" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Cultivation is not about self-improvement" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 2-5
So this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a></span> is - it sounds such a mechanical and dry word, but it's actually a very important part of what's going on, as I said. I remember - it was a couple of years ago. I taught a day <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> on <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> in London. And in the question and answer period, a gentleman stopped me. Well, he didn't really - he asked a question. And he said, "Conditioning, conditioning, conditioning!" [laughs] He said, "All this conditioning - isn't it just going round in the circles of what's conditioned? How are you going to move, how is the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> going to move towards what's Unconditioned? And the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> talks about what's Unconditioned as the goal of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>. Aren't you just playing endlessly, fiddling with conditions?" [laughter] ^2-5
###### 3-1
I think he was coming from a genuine, caring place. [laughter] I'm actually not sure to this day. But there is, first of all, the importance of just that relative level, of just <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a></span> the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, as I said. At one level the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, you could say - again, it's not a very glamorous <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, but the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is a web, a mass, a vortex, a spaghetti bowl of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span>, of conditioning. And we _can_ begin to recondition that. Tremendous amount of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span>, peace, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, etc., come out of that, just at <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conventional reality" data-href="Conventional reality" class="internal-link">the relative</a></span> level. And that's absolutely fine and actually crucial. _And_ there is the conditioning, the setting up of conditions, the nurturing of conditions that actually leads to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a></span>. And actually in its deepening, and in its unfoldment, leads towards <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a></span>, what is not conditioned, what is not born of conditions, what is not a condition. That's partly to do with what I'm going to talk about in this talk. I'll come back to that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Recondition i e working on a relative level brings well-being and sets up conditions that lead to the Unconditioned" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Recondition i e working on a relative level brings well-being and sets up conditions that lead to the Unconditioned" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
So this is all still review, but last point. As we do _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice - and many of you will have felt this to some degree, to any degree, any degree is good - that the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> can soften at times. And the actual self and the walls of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, the boundaries of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> begin to soften, begin to be more open, more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a></span>, more permeable, in a way. And this is hugely important because we get a glimpse of living without this self-<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="constriction" class="internal-link">constriction</a></span>, living without binding ourselves and defining ourselves and wrapping us up, wrapping ourselves up so much in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>. We begin to get a sense of perhaps <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>, or a flavour of this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>, this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">no-self</a></span>, this _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_. And so <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> just lead naturally to a less fixed, less rigid, less tightly bound <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> _at times_. At times it moves that way. And something in that opening, in that softening, begins to shake up and awaken some <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>. And again, giving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> to oneself - it's not building up the ego. It's not building up the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>. And to explore this in our lives and in our practice - the way the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> gets built up, the way the ego gets built up, is through a _problematic_ relationship with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, a judgmental, a critical, a harsh relationship with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, a rigidly defined relationship with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>.

Okay, so far, so good, I hope! All _that_ is in the realm of what we could call traditionally understood practices of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. I remember, quite some years ago - I don't remember when it was - I lived in America, and nearby was an urban non-residential <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">meditation centre</a></span>, Cambridge <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span> Center. And about twice a year, they would publish their programme of speakers and weekend <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span> and day <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span>, and this and that, and courses. And for a period of about, I don't know, five years at least, every time it would come out, twice a year, it would have a nice picture of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> on the front and a quote. And for about five years, the quote was from the _Lotus Sūtra_, one of the very influential <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a></span> _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sutra" data-href="Sutra" class="internal-link">sūtras</a></span>_.

End quote - "The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>." And usually I would just get the programme, and you know, "Who's coming? Yeah, very nice, okay. Which courses do I want to do?" And it took a while, but then at some point I just noticed, "Hold on. It doesn't say, 'See all _beings_ with the eyes of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>.' It says, 'See all _things_ with the eyes of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>.'" What could that mean? Does it mean to regard the microphone with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>?

Now, we could certainly hear something like that and be understandably quite perplexed at what on earth that is talking about. And actually, I have actually changed the translation here because I feel that there's been a misunderstanding there. But anyway, it's a difficult thing to understand<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Difficult to understand" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Difficult to understand" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-7

So a couple of words, translations: first of all, '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>' and '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>,' in a lot of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a></span> traditions, they use it interchangeably. Or rather, they more often use the word '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>' to mean both what we're talking about - <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> - and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>. Here they've done the same thing but with '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>.' Less rigidly different, the terms. So both of those statements, the _Lotus Sūtra_, "See all _things_ with the eyes of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>" - it means with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > In the Mahayana traditions compassion includes loving-kindness" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#In the Mahayana traditions compassion includes loving-kindness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-8
###### 4-9
And what is a _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dharma" class="internal-link">dharma</a></span>_? What does this mean - "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is based on _dharmas_, directed to _dharmas_"? A _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dharma" class="internal-link">dharma</a></span>_ has a lot of different meanings in the teachings. And one of them just kind of means 'things.' It just means 'things,' but it means 'things' as experiences or objects of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>. So some _thing_ arising in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> is a _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dharma" class="internal-link">dharma</a></span>_. So whatever that is - a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> sensation, a thought, an intention, a mood, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind state" class="internal-link">mind state</a></span>, a moment of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_, whatever it is, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> - they're all _dharmas_. So it's just a thing in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, a thing as an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Dharmas here mean things in experience i e objects of awareness" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Dharmas here mean things in experience i e objects of awareness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-9

**Yogi**: Are _dharmas_ never just things on their own?

Now, on one level, at first, this doesn't make any sense logically, and "What on earth is it talking about?" But we saw with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditation</a></span> this morning, and you've been practising today. Just to review that a little bit. We can, in our practice, direct this stream, at times, when we feel a stream of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, actually direct it towards <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, whatever the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> is, and actually bathe that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, _or_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, or both, or a mixture, or whatever it is. We can _hold_ it in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, _hold_ it in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, or _let_ it be held in that water of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. If you're just talking about the techniques now and the ways to experiment with it, we can use the phrases or just a word in the phrases, if that feels helpful. You can experiment with this mode of opening the door of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, opening the door of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, and totally, totally welcoming, just opening it up so it can be there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Recap guided meditation directing the stream of loving-kindness and compassion towards experience" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Recap guided meditation directing the stream of loving-kindness and compassion towards experience" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2

So emphasizing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, emphasizing the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, emphasizing the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span>,_ and not so much emphasizing the precise clarity of noticing or noting or seeing exactly what's going on. Oftentimes, when we talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> and we practise <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, that's what gets emphasized, is the clarity of what's going on, the clarity of seeing what's going on, the precision of seeing. So it's a different approach when one's _really_ emphasizing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span>, which also is talked about as part of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>. But really leaning towards emphasizing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span> aspect, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> aspect. Emphasizing a total welcoming, as long as it's genuine. One works in the practice to make it completely genuine, really, really welcoming this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> so that the arising of any <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> is completely welcomed, completely held in that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Emphasizing acceptance not so much precision and clarity" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Emphasizing acceptance not so much precision and clarity" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-3

The arising of all experiences, the staying - so an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a></span>, a _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dharma" class="internal-link">dharma</a></span>_ stays in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> for a while, short or long - and it passes. And so the arising is held in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, is bathed in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, is completely welcomed. The staying and the passing - completely held and bathed in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>. So as I said, there are a few different, _slight_ different emphases of approach even within what we just said. One can work in a more _directing_ way - so this is what came up this morning - can _direct_ that stream when one feels it, _direct_ that intentionality. Or it can be much more holding and much more of a kind of relaxing into a space that's imbued or shot through with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>. Much more receptive mode. One can be directing or receptive. It's fine<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Arising staying passing - held in love or direct that intentionality" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Arising staying passing - held in love or direct that intentionality" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-6
###### 5-7
At times, of course, what's going to come up is resistance or no feeling or whatever. But there's something about this. It's almost like, whatever's going on, the attitude of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span> and welcoming can always just expand a little bit and include whatever it is. Any resistance, any "I hate this, I hate ... _da-da-da-da-da_," whatever it is, just expands, so - "That's okay. Welcome, welcome, welcome." So in a way, there's nothing outside the domain, outside the range, of this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Nothing is outside it. Whatever's going on can actually be welcomed and included<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Whatever is going on the attitude of acceptence can always just expand a little and include whatever it is" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Whatever is going on the attitude of acceptence can always just expand a little and include whatever it is" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-7

In a way, for some people, a way in is, when we look inside, and what we encounter when we look inside is just a _stream_, so to speak, or an endless cornucopia, an endless arising and passing of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. It's just, whatever arises, it just passes. Whatever arises, it just passes. Everything is so fleeting. And so things, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a></span>, _dharmas_ are fleeting by their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span>, when we look at them. And in a way, you could say, they're deserving of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. They're impoverished. They barely last. You know? So question: what happens to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span> when we do this, when we bathe them in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, when we totally welcome, when we hold them in that? What happens to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span>? What happens to mental states<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Phenomena are fleeting by their nature so they are deserving of compassion" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Phenomena are fleeting by their nature so they are deserving of compassion" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^6-1

This is one option in the wealth of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> options there are. And one may take to it, or may not take to it. It's fine. And it's a practice. It's a practice that one can develop, and that's really important to see. But it can be, as it's been said, that things, _dharmas_, experiences, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a></span>, may soften. They soften. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of them actually softens. They begin, can begin to lose their edges. They can begin to lose their definition, to blur. Even, as Jeanette said, they can dissolve, or they can <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span>, either a little bit, or a lot, or completely.

The route doesn't matter, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> matters.

But let's explore this a little more. In <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> practice, there's actually an assumption there, quite a big one and often a subconscious one, one that we're not quite fully aware of. Or maybe we're actually saying it out loud. The assumption is that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> is something neutral. The assumption is that there's something called <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> that - this came up in a question and answer period a week or more than a week ago. The assumption is that there's something called '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>,' that what it can do is attend to things and see things in their naked actuality, something called '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>' which doesn't interfere in any way, and it's just seeing 'things as they are' - that phrase, 'things as they are,' which is a very well-worn phrase in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, 'things as they are.' And the assumption is that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> of the story, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> of my likes, dislikes, and all that, coming close to things, I'll see the bare actuality of what the thing _is_. Or I will see, be in touch with what _is_. And sometimes, even, as I say, more problematically, we can come to take as a view of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>, as a view of the goal, that the goal of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> is 'being with things as they are,' 'being with what is.' And these become very charged concepts: 'what is,' 'things as they are.' But again, that's never, never, never the goal of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>. It's a beautiful way of practising. It's a beautiful way of being - _cannot_ be the goal of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>. The goal of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> is an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, a very deep <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, that brings <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> with it. It brings <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>. It's something gone beyond this 'what is' and these notions. I'm going to fill that out<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > In mindfulness practice the assumption is often that mindfulness is neutral - things as they are" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#In mindfulness practice the assumption is often that mindfulness is neutral - things as they are" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-1

Now, let's explore this a little bit. It has to do with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. And if we just step back and look at how <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> works in our life, we have, all of us, had the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of feeling angry in some situation. And anyone who wants to kind of grow up and mature psychologically has to admit that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> _colours_ the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> at times. And we even have a phrase in English: one is 'seeing red.' I was seeing red, or he's seeing red; she's seeing red. The very words are implying this colouring of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. One's looking at the world, at the situation in that moment, through the lenses of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. And the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> is correspondingly changed - of a person, of ourselves, of a situation. And (some of you may have tasted this on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>) other extreme: when the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ feels like it's going very well, there's a softness, there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and one walks outside. And one's just having a cup of tea or whatever it is, and the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>_ - one feels there's a tranquillity there. It's almost that one is in a deva realm, in a heavenly realm - you know, obviously, just a short period of time. But it's something that can arise<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Example angers colours the perception and so does metta" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Example angers colours the perception and so does metta" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-2

When there's a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> around, how does the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> change? When there's a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> around, how does the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> change? When we are angry with another - and I've probably said this at some point in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> - typically when we're doing _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice, we think, "Oh, I'm angry at him or her. I should give _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ to them because, you know, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>'s bad, and I should kind of wish them _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ instead." Can be really skilful. What happens when, instead of immediately going to give the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ to the other person that we're angry at, we give the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ towards our self? Oftentimes we need it because we're feeling hurt. But it can be a very interesting place to start. And what one may find is that the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ to oneself - things begin to soften. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, the heart begins to soften because one's meeting oneself with _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span> - can_ do. Things soften, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> softens, the _eyes_ then soften, and the _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>_ softens, because <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> is dependent on the state of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > With metta towards the difficult person or towards oneself perception softens" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#With metta towards the difficult person or towards oneself perception softens" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-3

So, we could say we have a continuum of - at one end, murderous, homicidal rage. [laughs] And on the other end, beautiful <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, beautiful <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and the softness and the openness of that. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is _always_ - there's always some degree of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, moving towards an object or away from an object, pushing, pulling. There's always some degree of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. There's always some degree. So even with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, we tend to think, again, there's just this pure thing called '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>.' But any moment of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> has some degree of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> at <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, wanting to move towards it, pushing it away, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>.

**Yogi 4**: So neutral doesn't really exist? ^8-1
###### 8-2
**Rob**: Yeah, I'm going to explain. It's good! It's great! [laughter] So there's this spectrum. There's this spectrum, and any moment of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> from, as I said, complete rage to bliss of loving infinitely all beings, etc. - there's a range. Any moment of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> can be placed somewhere on that spectrum, somewhere on that continuum<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Any moment of consciousness can be placed somewhere on that spectrum" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Any moment of consciousness can be placed somewhere on that spectrum" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-2
###### 8-3
Which point on that continuum reveals the real object, the real way things are? So I see that with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> moving on this continuum, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span> change.

Human beings - actually _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Consciousness" data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousnesses</a></span>_, slugs, sheep, human beings, all of them - believe in real objects. Now, this is where this becomes very interesting. We can say, "No, it's all relative," and everything, and that's beautiful, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> is being born. And sometimes, though, even if we say that intellectually, we still believe at some level in real objects, internal and external. But as people have said, in a way, there is no real thing. There is no neutral point. There is no real object. There is no object independent<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > We might still believe at some level in real objects but there arent any" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#We might still believe at some level in real objects but there aren't any" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-11
###### 8-12
Now, someone _could_ say, "Okay, well, if it's not <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, then maybe it's that thing, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. I've heard about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>." And the word '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>' sounds, you know, _equal_ + _imity_ - whatever _imity_ is. [laughter] Somewhere in the middle, and maybe that's the neutral point, right there. But again, someone practising <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> practice deeply would notice the same thing - that as the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> deepens, objects are changed. There's a change of objects. So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> - the result of their presence, the result of them being in the heart, in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, is that objects make less impression in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>. They're less prominent in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>. And we can see this in the practice - sitting, walking, on the cushion. Certainly, as some of you have found out, when there's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, what happens when we do that? What happens when we do that? When there's an emotion, what happens when we bathe it in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > The presence of love and equanimity makes objects less prominent in consciousness" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#The presence of love and equanimity makes objects less prominent in consciousness" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^8-12
###### 9-1
And of course, one can see it off the cushion, outside of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> hall. So there's a situation that _really_ seems important or is troubling us a lot. And when there's a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, or when there's a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, it barely impacts. Or its importance just doesn't - it doesn't seem so crucial, so pressing. Or the actual fact of it barely imprints on <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Also off cushion when theres a lot of love or equanimity problems barely impact" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Also off cushion when there's a lot of love or equanimity problems barely impact" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-1
###### 9-2
There's a lot here. There's a tremendous amount here. On one level, what can be discovered here is what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> might call 'skilful means for easeful abiding,' for <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> abiding, skilful means to develop ease in life, in a situation. So this is one approach to when there's something difficult: being at ease with that. This is so important. Again, going back to the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> abiding - do we know, are we developing in our life, these skills to be able to be at ease more and more? How profoundly important that is to our life, to our whole sense of the quality of life and the ease of our life. Are we skilled? Are we interested in developing that skill of easeful abiding, of having ease? Even when something difficult is going on - one has an illness or there's a difficult situation, or whatever it is - there's the possibility for ease with that. So, skilful means for ease. But also, there are <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span> here, and they're extremely important and profound<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Be interested in developing the skill of easful abiding" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Be interested in developing the skill of easful abiding" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-2
###### 9-3
So the first one is that it's the relationship that is important. It's the relationship with what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> is; it's the relationship with any object that's important. Oftentimes in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> practice or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Zen" class="internal-link">Zen</a></span> practice or whatever it is, we're giving <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to objects, giving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> - and understandably; that's kind of what we're told to do. But sometimes we're so kind of transfixed with what's going on, with the object going on, we're giving it so much <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> that we don't see what's around that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, the relationship that we have with the object. Sometimes we don't even realize what that relationship is. Putting it very crudely, you _could_ say, relationship with objects - _dharmas_, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a></span> - <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span> are basically either a relationship of peace or a relationship of struggle: trying to hang on, trying to get rid of, whatever. So it's either a relationship of peace or a relationship of struggle. When there's _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, in that relationship with whatever's going on - <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is peace. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a></span> is a relationship of peace. To have that relationship of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is to have a relationship of peace, basically<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Relationships with dharmas are either of love and peace or of struggle" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Relationships with dharmas are either of love and peace or of struggle" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-3
###### 9-4
And we can see. We can see that when the relationship is non-struggling with what's difficult, it's non-struggling, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> goes out of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. The <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> goes out of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> to the degree that we can soften our struggle with it. To the degree that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> comes into that relationship, that peace comes into that relationship, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> goes out of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. This is so crucial. And again, when we struggle with something, we tend to think, "I have this problem," or "This thing going on in my life or this thing going on in my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> _is_ a problem." To practise this way and to see, inherently, it cannot be a problem. It cannot. In <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> language we say it's _empty_ of problem. The problem is empty. The problem is something _we_ bring into it through our relationship with it. In itself, any <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> is empty of problem. It's so important, that level of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. So absolutely crucial. And you can - even as I say it, you get a sense of the immense kind of both potential and responsibility that gives to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>. Immense. That's one level, and we can go a bit deeper<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > The suffering goes out of experience to the degree that we can soften our struggle with it" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#The suffering goes out of experience to the degree that we can soften our struggle with it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-4

And so this is what we were talking about before. And people were saying, "There is no real object," etc. Earlier in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, we were talking about moments, at times, that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> can open up into this sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> or communion.

And if you remember that lovely note that I read out in one of the talks in the first week from the work retreatant, she was talking about this big black space filled with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and holding everything. Beautiful opening. And to have the sense of that and very sort of mystical, religious sense for some people. That, too, is coming out of conditions.

But if you read the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta Sutta" data-href="Metta Sutta" class="internal-link">Mettā Sutta</a></span>_, and if you just read it with an open <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, it basically describes _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> of all that and what one should do, and then says, "This leads to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a></span>."

So in a way, we talk about things and objects and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. The truth of them, in a way, is not that they exist, really, or that they don't exist. They exist dependent on our relationship _with_. So in this teaching of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, it's called 'the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span>': a middle between saying things exist and saying they don't exist. It's called 'the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span>,' neither existing - and it's not sort of, "Well, they exist kind of half of the time," or something like that. [laughs] It's something that's beyond those. To say things don't exist is clearly not true. But to see that they don't exist in any way independently from the way I am looking, independently from the relationship with. So when it says they don't exist, it means they don't exist independently, inherently. Or as the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tibetan Buddhism" data-href="Tibetan Buddhism" class="internal-link">Tibetans</a></span> say, they don't exist 'from their own side.' ^10-4

And to begin to see into relationship that we have with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> is actually to begin to see into <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. It's to begin to see into <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>.

So as I said, we can see this in formal <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation practice</a></span> - sitting, walking, etc. You can also see it in one's life or in more complex situations. For example, take a situation like a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">meditation retreat</a></span>. And one comes, and one comes on _this_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. Come to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a></span>, three weeks of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and you think, "Great! I'm really going to work on my _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ and get really quiet and calm," and then one comes into the hall, and it's pretty packed in here, and someone's shuffling next to you or coughing or whatever it is, and irritation arises. And the whole view of the situation, of that person, is seen through the lens of irritation. We've come into the situation with the agenda of 'what I want,' and that's colouring everything. And then the view, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, changes<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Example irritations in the meditation hall" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Example irritations in the meditation hall" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-6

We can play with this. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> of practice is that you can play with all this and experiment with it. Could I change that view in a situation like this or some other <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>? And this person is restless, or whatever it is - could I view that situation, then, as an opportunity to learn patience? Then every time there's some disturbance, it's an opportunity to learn patience. And the whole view has changed. Or if you're super advanced, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vajrayana" data-href="Vajrayana" class="internal-link">Vajrayāna</a></span> ... [laughs] You sit there and forget the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_, forget everything: "My whole purpose of being here is to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> you, just you." [laughs] Play with it. What happens? The view changes and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> changes. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> we have of things is dependent on the view, of how we're seeing<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Play with different perceptions of the situation" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Play with different perceptions of the situation" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-1

So I was speaking about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> some talks ago, and can draw this into that area as well. And <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is a very interesting one because it can be quite clear with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. We tend to think, we tend to feel, we tend to believe that there's some thing or event going on or about to go on or will go on in the future, and then I have <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> about that. I'm afraid of that. And somehow in there is the assumption that the thing and the event and the situation and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> are separate, they're separate, and that they're independent. There's, again, an object, any object, and there's how I might relate to it. And I could relate with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> or with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> or whatever it is, but the object is still the object no matter how I relate to it. And begin to get the sense that that's not really the case. Now, with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, to a degree, at least intellectually, it's obvious. We can see how <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> colours our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. You know, you're afraid walking at night in the dark, and you see the shadows, and it looks like, you know, a big ... [laughter] And it's not. It's just the shadows coloured with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> from the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > With fear the object and the fear are not independent" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#With fear the object and the fear are not independent" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-2

**Yogi 9**: How does that relate to doing? You know, because doing is not an object. So you're fearful of doing something, a performance, maybe, or exercising a skill, but there's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> around your performance<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Being fearful of doing something is still a situation youre viewing" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Being fearful of doing something is still a situation you're viewing" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-3

And when I talked about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> before, I mentioned that a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is caught up with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a></span>. We're often afraid of something in the future, and the thinking around it is something in the future. Even if it's next few seconds or a long time in the future, whatever, it's future-thinking based. If I believe in 'the present,' if I believe in a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="present moment" class="internal-link">present moment</a></span>, a present situation, as something that has real, independent existence - if I believe in the present, then <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of the future is inevitable. It's just waiting to happen. And to use the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s analogy, "as sure as the wheels of the cart follow the ox that pulls it," if I believe in the inherent existence of the present, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of the future will come.^[Dhp 1] There will be <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of the future. But we can see, through these practices and others, that the present lacks inherent existence. It's not independent. The past, too, is not independent<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > A lot of fear is future-thinking based" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#A lot of fear is future-thinking based" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-9

So I can think back on - you know, one thinks back on romances of one's past life. [laughs] Depending on one's mood, you know, it's like, "Ah, she/he/they were lovely, and wasn't that sweet?" [laughs] And in another mood, you think back, and you think, "Yikes! What was I thinking!" [laughter] Or you know, if I think back to my education, my school, my high school, and sometimes I think back, and it was a very pressured environment academically, and a lot of cruelty - I went to boys' school - a lot of, yeah, cruelty. And sometimes I look back in another mood, and I think, "Yeah, we really had a laugh. That was really fun. That was really ..." You know. The present is not independent; the past is also not independent. They depend on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind state" class="internal-link">mind state</a></span> in the present. The future is the same. The future is the same. The future is only going to become present and past. It's dependent. It's not independent. It's empty. When I begin to see this, it's like, I don't really believe in the present; you can't really believe in the future. And if you can't really believe in the future, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> has no footing. It has no footing.

If we go back to that _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aksayamati Sutra" data-href="Aksayamati Sutra" class="internal-link">Akṣayamati Sūtra</a></span>_, and talked about three sort of levels, and in the third level it said, "for those who have seen deeply into <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>," or seen <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a></span> or whatever, "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is not based on anything at all." And just to briefly explore this. It appears in other traditions as well, and other sources. The Sufi poet <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Rumi" class="internal-link">Rumi</a></span> has a lovely poem which I read once and have since misplaced or cannot find again. But he talks about, or a couple of lines in it, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> without an object - <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> without an object, not based on anything at all. It's not even <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> towards all beings or all things; it's actually without an object. And again, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> can just be, like, baffled by that. He says, "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a></span> without an object," and I think the next line is, "That's the best <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> of all.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Love without an object thats the best love of all" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Love without an object that's the best love of all" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^12-2

In a way, actually, I want to just drop something in here which I may have said before, but I think it's pertinent. I think it's important, when one's listening to teachings and such, to notice one's reaction to what's being said. So often I was talking about this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> without an object and very sort of deep teachings or high teachings or whatever. And just interesting to notice what goes on for us when we hear that. There's a whole range of reactions that are possible. Some people hear something like that - and I see this quite a lot - and just turn off, just turn off. Something just shuts down - can't hear it, don't want to hear it. Or you know, I see people picking at their nails and stuff. [laughter] Something goes on - don't want to know, can't handle it. Or we may get _really_ excited. And there's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> of that; there's a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> excitement. But sometimes we get so excited that we think, "Where I am now is completely irrelevant and not worth anything. _That's_ where I want to go." Or a kind of intense striving can come into practice. I think it's just important to see where this is landing in the moment, in oneself. And just to notice that. And of course, it can land in a very lovely place of just simple aspiration. But there's a range there, and it differs at different times, and just to see<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Where are those teachings landing with you" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Where are those teachings landing with you" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-4

The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> talked about two movements of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, two energies: _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">taṇhā</a></span>_, which literally translates as 'thirst' - this never ... unfulfillable, endless wanting, wanting, wanting, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. And another <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> called _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="chanda" class="internal-link">chanda</a></span>_, which - they're both kind of '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>.' You could translate them both as '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>.' But _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="chanda" class="internal-link">chanda</a></span>_ is more 'aspiration,' 'will to do.' It's actually the fuel for our practice. And where do teachings land? Does _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">taṇhā</a></span>_ grab hold of them and make a problem out of it?

Do they land in _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="chanda" class="internal-link">chanda</a></span>_? And so, there is really a place for healthy, noble, beautiful aspiration in our practice. And we can hear stuff, and it lands in a good place. I think it just needs some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, just to notice what goes on. And I don't know where it's from, but the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of walking, wanting to climb a mountain. And there's the mountain in the distance, and one wants to get to the mountain peak, and one has one's vision set on that, but also just the footstep in front of one. And one holds both.

And that is, in its depth, it's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a></span>. So it's very different then from the typical Hollywood scenario of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>; we've moved quite a way since that. And in its depths, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a></span>. Like <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, it's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a></span>. And we see - again to reiterate, there are a couple of things here. We see that - John talked about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dependent origination" class="internal-link">dependent origination</a></span>, so he probably talked about that link between <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> and then the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that comes out of that. And that's one link. Did he talk about this? That's one link that's very available to our scrutiny and experimentation. We can actually learn to relax the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> and see the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> go out. It doesn't feed <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, in their depths, are <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a></span> - there isn't a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a></span> or a pulling towards. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Non-grasping</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > In its depth the nature of love is non-grasping" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#In its depth the nature of love is non-grasping" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-2

But we can go a little bit deeper with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dependent origination" class="internal-link">dependent origination</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Grasping</a></span> _makes_ the way things appear; it is something that _makes_ the way things appear. Also, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> makes things appear. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Grasping</a></span> makes the world appear. So this is completely counterintuitive. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Grasping</a></span> makes the world appear. We tend to think, "The world is _there_.

###### 13-5
**Rob**: [laughs] I think ... Well, first of all, to see it in one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, that with this kind of practice, when one's emphasizing this approach, the more welcoming there is, basically the less <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, the less <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a></span> and pulling towards (we say "less <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">pushing and pulling</a></span>"; that's less <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>), and what we notice is that the world, the world of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, appears less. And if there's really very little <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>, it can be that very little appears at all. It just kind of dissolves, dissolves, dissolves. So it's really to see that. And to conclude from that, there's something about <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> that's actually building <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. I don't know that one can explain it any more than that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > The less grasping the less appears at all" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#The less grasping the less appears at all" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-5

**Yogi 10**: I realize that. ^14-1

**Rob**: But the seeing of it is absolutely crucial. I mean, if we talk about - what does it mean? What does <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">liberation</a></span> mean? There's no <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">liberation</a></span> without seeing that. And then if you really want to turn your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> inside out, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> builds <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. What builds <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>? <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a></span>. I can't grasp without anything to grasp at. Dependent co-origination - the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> cannot get around this. It cannot put it into nice, neat little packets: "There's _this,_ and then there's _this_, and then there's _this_, and this is different.

So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dependent origination" class="internal-link">dependent origination</a></span> is a map, a conceptual map that eats [itself], like a snake eating its own tail, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual framework</a></span> that leads to the dissolving of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a></span>. It's pretty far out. [laughter] Not easy to understand, so I really know that I'm not talking about stuff that's easy to understand. But we _can_ begin to see this. This is the amazing thing: we _can_ begin to see this. And when one sees it, the more one sees it, the implications are totally radical. It turns our basic intuitions about life and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> inside out, upside down, on their head. That's how radical the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> is. And begin to see, there is no _thing_. There is no thing independent, independently existing, no separate thing. No thing, no problem! The problems that I make in life are dependent on me relating to things as separate things<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Dependent origination is a conceptual framework which dissolves itself" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Dependent origination is a conceptual framework which dissolves itself" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-3
###### 14-4
So we also see that as we let go of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>, we notice that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> is also a factor which clouds our seeing. When there's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>, we're blurring our vision. We're covering up our vision. We're distorting our vision through that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>. So, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a></span> also lead, bring with them, a seeing more deeply, more clearly. In <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> terms, what does it mean to see more deeply and more clearly? It means to see things like <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> and this very <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, to see that more clearly. That's what it means. And out of that seeing more clearly comes <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> and actually comes even more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. And the whole thing builds <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>, and builds - or rather, it opens <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>. It allows <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > When theres grasping we are blurring our vision" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#When there's grasping we are blurring our vision" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-4
###### 14-5
Now, it _can_ be that hearing about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, when we first hear about it, it sounds very <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nihilism" data-href="Nihilism" class="internal-link">nihilistic</a></span>, very destructive teaching, very scary often, teaching. But if our practice of it and contemplation of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> is not leading to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, is not opening <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to some degree, there's something askew in how we're seeing it, in how we're practising it, in how we're viewing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. So by its <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span>, it should lead to more of a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. If it's not, we need to look again. There's something we're not quite <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>. We're just a bit off balance with it. But it leads to more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, to less of a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a></span>, less of a sense of barriers, less of a sense of fault-finding with oneself, with others, with situations, even - less self-inflating, deflating, etc. And in a way, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> of practice as it deepens is to see that - we begin to see that all things are empty. All things. So selves are empty - my self, another self. Things are empty - so-called 'inner' things, so-called 'outer' things. _Minds_ are empty - what we call '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>' is actually empty, doesn't really exist as something separate, independent. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Suffering</a></span>, too, is empty. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Suffering</a></span> doesn't actually exist independently. And somehow, with all of that, in all of that, mysteriously, even though no selves, no others, no <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, even, somehow, more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is coming out of it, in the sort of mystery of the paradox of it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Emptiness practice should lead to love and compassion" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Emptiness practice should lead to love and compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-5
###### 15-1
And so I want to reiterate, I'm aware that sometimes we hear this, and it just, "I don't know what this is talking about." But this is actually possible for us. This really is possible. So if not through this avenue, through other <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> avenues. We _can_ open this up, in a very real way that begins to have a very real impact on our lives and the way we live<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > This is possible for us" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#This is possible for us" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-1
###### 15-2
Just finally, from the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aksayamati Sutra" data-href="Aksayamati Sutra" class="internal-link">Akṣayamati Sūtra</a></span>_ and from our practice, we can see that there's a _continuum_ or a _spectrum_ of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, we could say. That's not a very good word. Or _levels_ of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> - even worse word. But the human <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> moves on that continuum. It has to move on that continuum. So sometimes we do not feel <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, and we're just sitting here kind of really grinding away at the phrases, planting the seeds of intention. Sometimes we even feel angry, and yet we're trying. And that very trying, even though we're feeling nothing or feeling the opposite, _is_ an expression of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> - absolutely. And there's a whole spectrum right from there, all the way through <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> to self and other and humdrum, "I <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> my cat, I <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> whatever it is," all the through to this very exalted-sounding <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> without an object. And that's all there. And the human <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, amazingly, can move on that spectrum. It _does_ move on that spectrum. And that whole spectrum is available for us. And in a way, our very humanity is _in_ that movement. So we can't always be in the exalted realms - no way. Our very humanity is in the movement. And in a way, our very humility is in the movement. It _has_ to move<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > The whole spectrum of love is available for us" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#The whole spectrum of love is available for us" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-2

Rob: Careful. It may work at times for you. Play with it, play with it. But there's probably something in it that doesn't cover quite - <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> has a lot of aspects to what it means. And in a way, it's also very thorough. So it's like, sometimes we can have a word like that, and we're leaving something unchallenged. And there needs to be a real thoroughness. So we've got rid of a lot of stuff, but there's left this sense of a womb or whatever, and that kind of thing. But it may be a really important stepping-stone, so don't necessarily just throw it out immediately. You want to experiment with it a little bit. But bear in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, it's probably not going to be a final resting place<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Play with other words but emptiness has a lot of aspects to what it means" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Play with other words but emptiness has a lot of aspects to what it means" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-10

###### 16-4
Rob: No, it's good. This is really important. Thank you very much for bringing it up. There are certain experiences that are deep experiences, quite common, and relatively speaking, quite accessible for a committed meditator. One of them will be a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> opening out in very vast <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span>, and one is just open and being. There's very little <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, and just a sense of things emerging from this space in quite an insubstantial way, emerging from the space and disappearing back into it. Beautiful state, very open, oftentimes brings a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and a lot of sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> with it. Not that far off for a committed meditator. If it sounds fantastic, it's actually not that far off. Very, very beautiful, a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> in it, a lot to learn from it, and yet what happens - and I see it so much. And it's gone on more than 2,000 years. It predates the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> - one then gives an inherent existence to that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span>, and that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span> as a womb, as a source. It reifies that, and then people substitute the word '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>' for that empty space. It's a beautiful and, for a lot of people, a really necessary stepping-stone<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Womb can point to spaciousness which can be an important stepping-stone" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Womb can point to spaciousness which can be an important stepping-stone" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-4

So the other extreme (and I should have said it when I was talking) is these states that can open - <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>, or this kind of big space out of which everything is emerging, or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> that is woven into the fabric of the universe - beautiful states, you don't also want to rush through them. So again, there's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span> here: you don't want to stop there, pitch your camp, build your house, say, "I've arrived. Now all I need to do is just get used to this," and say, "This is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ultimate truth" data-href="Ultimate truth" class="internal-link">the ultimate</a></span> truth. I've discovered it." [laughter] It happens! Believe me. It happens in texts you can find - it's gone on for thousands and thousands of years. I meet people all the time where this has gone on, people who have done a lot of practice. So it's very tempting to do that. So you don't want to do that on one extreme. But on the other extreme, you don't want to just say, "Oh, this is just another condition. Better get going!" [laughter] There's something in opening to a state like that - whatever it is, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharmadhatu" data-href="Dharmadhatu" class="internal-link">infinite consciousness</a></span> pervading the universe - these are all quite related states, very, very, potentially incredibly transforming for the long term. People often fall into one of two extremes with them.

Yogi 2: Is that because it's conditioned? ^17-1
###### 17-2
Rob: Well, to say - how do you mean? ^17-2
###### 17-3
Yogi 2: Well, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of that, if you're in meditative states - it _is_ conditioned. ^17-3
###### 17-4
Rob: The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> that you were describing is still conditioned. Now, there's a sense - and as I said, it's a very beautiful sense - that a person in that state will feel, what's conditioned is the things arising and passing back into that state. But the space itself, what some people call _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharmadhatu" data-href="Dharmadhatu" class="internal-link">dharmadhātu</a></span>_, or some people call it _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="rigpa" class="internal-link">rigpa</a></span>_, or a lot of different charged words get used, or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharmadhatu" data-href="Dharmadhatu" class="internal-link">infinite consciousness</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharmadhatu" data-href="Dharmadhatu" class="internal-link">cosmic consciousness</a></span>, etc. - [a person will feel] that that's _unconditioned_. It can seem, in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> - very beautiful - that that's _so_ steady. And everything else, all other <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> - <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a></span>, thoughts, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> - all that is arising out of the stillness, _imperturbable_ stillness, and dying back into it. One _feels_ like one is seeing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="birth" class="internal-link">birth</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, and what remains seems unconditioned, and it's _there_. And it's just a matter of, sometimes I lose contact with it; then I get back into contact. But still, one hasn't seen and understood at the deepest level the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> said to understand fully the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> is to be fully awakened. Put that way, it doesn't sound very sexy, does it? [laughter] But there's something in there - it's so _uncompromising,_ and so, kind of, "I won't put the pole here; I'll keep going, keep the questioning alive," until one has totally understood this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span> and how anything at all - no matter how beautiful, how subtle, how refined, how seemingly ultimate - comes to be. And that doesn't mean dismissing everything as just conditions, and it's just all irrelevant. It doesn't mean that at all, because one also opens to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> of what that means as well. So, thank you. It's a really, really important question<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > To understand fully the nature of perception is to be fully awakened" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#To understand fully the nature of perception is to be fully awakened" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-4

###### 17-8
Rob: Are people clear with the practice side of this approach? ^17-8
###### 17-9
Yogi: No. [laughs] You spoke about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, but what I've been working with today is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span>. It's very much not future-based. In fact, it feels very old, you know, and it just gets [?]. And it's not dissolving. Maybe I can just apply a little bit more patience, or maybe I'm not applying the method in quite a right way. But it did hang around all day. I mean, in some way, it doesn't matter. So what? It's been thirty years ... [?] I mean, am I just not applying the method right? Because it's closely related to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, but it's not <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. There isn't really any thinking, and certainly not any <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="future thinking" class="internal-link">future thinking</a></span>. It's just hanging around. Because I know where it comes from, I was trying to picture it wrapped up in a nice, cosy [?]. ^17-9
###### 18-1
That was kind of how the, you know, sort of surrounding it with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> when it was coming. But it didn't dissolve. In fact, it got worse - or should I say, stronger and even less pleasant than it was at the beginning this ...? ^18-1
###### 18-2
Rob: Okay. I'm not sure if you're doing it right or not. It's possible that there is a hidden agenda of trying to get rid of it through doing this. ^18-2
###### 18-3
Yogi: Not that I can see, but yeah, if it's hidden I wouldn't see it. [laughter] ^18-3
###### 18-4
Rob: Okay. It's possible. So you could try just really going to more of a sense of welcoming, rather than wrapping it in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. Really, really welcoming - that's one option. Remember, this is just one technique, one approach out of many. But if you want to explore it further, I would emphasize the total accepting and the welcoming. When anything comes up - whatever it is, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span> or anything at all - there's conditioning from the past. As you say, this comes from the past. But that past conditioning is _not enough_ for it to arise in the present. A thing cannot arise in the present without me doing something as well in the present. And you _can't_ change the past, so to speak, but what we can do is understand, "What is it that I'm putting _in_ in the present which is sustaining or even allowing this thing to arise?<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Play with a sense of welcoming rather than wrapping fear in love" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Play with a sense of welcoming rather than wrapping fear in love" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^18-4

Yogi: Is it going to be one of the three root poisons? ^18-5
###### 18-6
Rob: You mean greed, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>? Yes, absolutely. ^18-6
###### 18-7
Yogi: I did start to see a little bit of self-identification there, just in the last sitting. But I hadn't seen that before. ^18-7
###### 18-8
Rob: Yeah, so that would be another approach very similar to what we're doing. Self-identification, like <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>, is a builder of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. It turns out that when we identify with what's going on, that also builds things. So you could go - if you got a foot in the door that way, great. And you can find, "What happens when I ...?" It's just something going on, and one is identified less and less. It's also, one's building <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> less<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Self-identification like grasping is a builder of experience" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Self-identification like grasping is a builder of experience" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^18-8
###### 18-9
Yogi: So how would I do that? ^18-9
###### 18-10
Rob: Well, how did you - you noticed there was identification? ^18-10
###### 18-11
Yogi: Yeah, I just noticed it. ^18-11
###### 18-12
Rob: Okay. Is it possible to see an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> as 'just happening - it doesn't really belong to _me_'<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Seeing an experience as just happening not belonging to me" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Seeing an experience as just happening not belonging to me" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^18-12

Rob: These are practices that take time. If it's not working today and one needs relief today, then introduce some other aspect - <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to oneself or whatever. So again, it's just some people this will be significant for, others less so. Most people, anyway, it's something to develop over time, and it's one of many practices. You want to have a range of options that you can draw from<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > These practices take time" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#These practices take time" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^19-1

###### 19-3
Yogi: I was wondering, it seems like the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">unwholesome</a></span> states definitely need <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>, but what about the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> states? I just say, "Oh, this doesn't _need_ ..." ^19-3

What happens? Does anyone ...? ^19-4

Yogi 2: More <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> comes. ^19-5
###### 19-6
Rob: What did you find, Toni? Did you try it, or you just thought it was perplexing, and you didn't try? ^19-6
###### 19-7
Yogi: It was perplexing, because I felt, though I had a feeling of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="gratitude" class="internal-link">gratitude</a></span> that arose, I said, "Well, this really doesn't _need_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>!" ^19-7
###### 19-8
Rob: Yeah, lovely. Okay. I mean, you could _not_ worry about whether it needs it or not, or whether it seems to need it, and just go ahead and give it some and see what happens. [laughter] ^19-8
###### 19-9
Yogi: It just felt - I mean, why give <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>? It didn't make any sense. ^19-9
###### 19-10
Rob: Absolutely, yeah, sure, understandable. So one thing is to just bypass that thinking and just go ahead and do it. Another thing is what I said about experiences and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a></span> are fleeting. So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="gratitude" class="internal-link">gratitude</a></span> is something - metaphorically speaking, all <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> is impoverished because of its fleeting <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span>. And it's almost like it's just part of the stream of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, and so give it <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, you know, using metaphorical, almost poetic kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>. Don't think about it; just do it. It's more, we're interested in the ability to do that. As someone said, "If I do that, then maybe something opens up _more_." So again, skilful abiding in ease, and deepening ease, and also the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> - "What happens when I do it?" So I would just kind of set it aside and just go ahead, full steam ahead<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Just do it" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Just do it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^19-10

**Q4: welcoming <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> experiences as well as difficult experiences** ^19-11
###### 19-12
Yogi: I sort of related to that. I mean, you were saying about this is complete welcoming, like when the first sun comes out in the spring, and you completely open to it. That - <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a></span> things arising - it seems to me it's fairly easy to do that. But you know, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, something like that - I mean, this is going to take time, isn't it, to kind of find a way? ^19-12
###### 20-1
Rob: It may take time, absolutely. So I mean, people are very different. Some people immediately pick up on something, that it's actually easing this - like I said, when there's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> there, when there's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a></span> and pulling, there's more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. So even though there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, it pays to relax the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>. Some people see that immediately, and it's just very clear: "Well, okay. Let's just do that." Others, it takes longer, and it's fine. And so, it may take time, but it also may not take time. Is it harder with more difficult experiences? Yeah, maybe, but also maybe not. Just play with it. Play with it and see<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > People are different - just play with it and see" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#People are different - just play with it and see" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^20-1

Yogi: Could you tell again more about these hidden agendas to get rid of stuff with _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_? ^20-3
###### 20-4
Rob: Yeah. Well, if one directs <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> towards something or bathes it in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, and then one notices, "Oh, this problematic thing goes away a little bit," and then a little time goes by, and something else problematic comes up, and the immediate thought is, "Ah, I'll knock it on the head with some _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_!" [laughter] "And hopefully that'll get rid of it." One just has to watch that that's the intention, or if that's there. And it _will_ creep in. It will creep in, but can one either be coming from, as much as possible, a place of curiosity? I'm just curious what it does when I do that, just curious. So it's a different thing. I'm not looking for it to go away. I'm just curious about how things arise and what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> is. So either curiosity or one can just kind of intend for the welcoming to be completely genuine, just really, really genuine. So it's something you have to feel when it's there, and just try and soften it or open it more inside<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Be curious what metta does" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Be curious what metta does" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^20-4

Are we trying to do that? Why not pitching a tent ... [?] ^20-6
###### 20-7
Rob: I don't know how to answer that question, but I know that it's possible to open to something which is unconditioned in a way that brings <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>, and in a way, that's all we need to know - that that's possible, and that the conditions, we can take care of the conditions that move us towards that. That's possible. Whether it's something conditioned experiencing something unconditioned, or - I don't know about that. I don't think that's quite the right question. It's more like, "Is it possible to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> something <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="unfabricated" class="internal-link">unfabricated</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">unborn</a></span>, unconditioned, deathless?" Yes. Yes, it's possible, you could say, for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> to open out into that.
