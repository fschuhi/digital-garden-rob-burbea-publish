###### 1-1
(00:00, [[Meditation|guided meditation]] begins) ^1-1
###### 1-2
Taking a moment or two to really establish yourself in your [[Meditation|meditation posture]]. Settling into the uprightness of that posture. The openness, the presence. Also softening in the [[Embodiment|body]], softening into the [[Embodiment|body]], into the presence in the [[Embodiment|body]]. Just sitting with that light, open sensitivity to the [[Embodiment|whole body]]. Just the whole general feeling of the [[Embodiment|whole body]], the [[energy]] field of the [[Embodiment|whole body]], sensitive to the [[Embodiment|whole body]]. Just present there. That open and [[Spaciousness|spacious]] [[awareness]][[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#Posture energy field of the whole body|.]] ^1-2
###### 1-3
Just noticing, perhaps in this moment something stands out. Something is prominent in your [[experience]]. Perhaps some sensations in the [[Embodiment|body]], some sensations somewhere in the [[Embodiment|body]]. Perhaps an emotion. Perhaps a feeling or a [[mind state]]. Just noticing. Maybe something is prominent, maybe not. If nothing is particularly prominent, then just being in the [[Embodiment|body]], the [[Embodiment|whole body]], with whatever is in [[consciousness]] in this moment[[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#Maybe something stands out as prominent in your experience|.]] ^1-3
###### 1-4
Then with whatever may be prominent, or whatever is just present in [[consciousness]] right now, beginning very gently to bathe that [[experience]] in [[Metta|kindness]], in [[compassion]]. So directing the stream of [[Metta|loving-kindness]] and [[compassion]] towards that [[experience]] itself, whatever the prominent [[experience]] right now, or whatever any [[experience]] in [[consciousness]] right now, just bathing it with [[Metta|kindness]], with tenderness. Holding the [[experience]] in [[compassion]], in [[Metta|kindness]], allowing it to be held in [[Metta|kindness]] and [[compassion]]. Just over and over, whatever is standing out, whatever is prominent in the [[experience]]. Washing it, bathing it, holding it, in [[love]] and [[compassion]][[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#Bathe that experience in kindness and compassion|.]] ^1-4
###### 1-5
You may find different ways of doing this work at different times. Bathing the [[experience]], directing the stream of [[love]] and [[compassion]] and [[Metta|kindness]] towards [[experience]]. Holding the [[experience]] in [[compassion]], [[Metta|kindness]]. Can also be a total welcoming, a complete, utter, total welcoming of the [[experience]], whatever the [[experience]] is. As if you're opening the doors of [[awareness]] very wide, very [[Spaciousness|spacious]], to welcome. Complete, radical [[acceptance]] of the [[experience]], whatever it is. Or you may find the phrases or a word from one of the phrases helpful to direct the [[Metta|kindness]], to direct the [[compassion]], towards an [[experience]][[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#Bathing holding total welcoming|.]] ^1-5
###### 1-6
So you're open with [[experience]] as it's present, but very much directing or holding it in [[Metta|kindness]], in tenderness, total [[acceptance]], [[compassion]]. Welcoming, welcoming[[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#Being open with experience as it's present but very much holding it in kindness welcoming it|.]] ^1-6
###### 1-7
Just over and over, whatever it is that's there, whatever is going on in the [[experience]], directing the stream of [[Metta|kindness]], of [[compassion]], towards it. Holding it, surrounding it, permeating it with [[love]] and [[compassion]]. Completely welcoming, totally welcoming the [[experience]]. Being open, but [[letting go]] - for now, for now - of the usual precision of [[mindfulness]]. "Want to notice what's going on very clearly" - just letting that go, and instead being open, being with what's going on, but very much emphasizing [[Metta|kindness]], emphasizing [[compassion]], emphasizing total [[acceptance]]. [[Letting go]] of the usual emphasis on precision[[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#Being open but letting go of the usual precision of mindfulness|.]] ^1-7
###### 1-8
Whatever you're conscious of in the moment - let's say [[Embodiment|body]] sensation, emotion, feeling, a [[mind state]], a persistent thought, whatever it is, gross or subtle - bathing it in tenderness, holding it in [[compassion]]. If, as you're doing this, sometimes the edges of an [[experience]] of [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] begin to blur, begin to dissolve or lose definition, if an [[experience]] begins to [[Emptiness|fade]], that's completely okay. Completely okay[[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#It's ok if an experience begins to fade|.]] ^1-8
###### 2-1
Over and over and over, bathing [[experience]], bathing whatever's there, in [[Metta|kindness]]. Welcoming it totally in [[Metta|kindness]]. Whatever arises, its arising is held in [[Metta|kindness]]. Its staying is held, is bathed, in [[Metta|kindness]]. Its passing is held and bathed in [[Metta|kindness]][[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#Arising staying passing - holding it in kindness|.]] ^2-1
###### 2-2
Whatever it is that comes up, if there's resistance or numbness, holding that in [[Metta|kindness]]. Total, complete welcoming. If there's no feeling, if there's boredom, [[anger]], [[fear]], confusion, whatever it is in this moment, bathing it in [[love]], totally welcoming it, over and over. Nothing is exempt. Nothing is out of the range. Whatever is there, whatever is going on in the [[Embodiment|body]], whatever is going on in the [[mind]][[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#If there's resistence or numbness - holding it in kindness|.]] ^2-2
###### 2-3
If there's [[Hindrances|restlessness]] or agitation, if there is peace, a feeling of peace, a feeling of [[happiness]], including that. Bathing, holding those [[Phenomenon|phenomena]], the experiences, those [[feelings]], in [[Metta|kindness]] and tenderness. Opening the door of [[awareness]], opening the door of [[consciousness]] for that, welcoming completely[[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#Restlessness peace - welcoming it completely|.]] ^2-3
###### 2-4
Sometimes, as we're practising, an [[image]] or a sense of ourselves in the moment, an [[image]] of ourselves sitting here, comes up. Bathing that [[experience]] in [[Metta|kindness]][[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#If image of self comes up - bathing that experience in kindness|.]] ^2-4
###### 2-5
So including everything, whatever is in [[consciousness]] in the moment. Bathing it, holding it, touching it with that stream of [[Metta|kindness]], with that ocean of [[Metta|kindness]]. Including everything. You can even include the [[Metta|kindness]] itself. You can include the intention of [[Metta|kindness]], the intention towards [[Metta|kindness]]. Gross or subtle, whatever is in [[consciousness]] in the moment[[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#Including everything bathing it holding it touching it|.]] ^2-5
###### 2-6
Complete welcoming, over and over[[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#Complete welcoming over and over|.]] ^2-6
