So we can <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a></span>, develop, expand the heart's capacity for <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>. That is possible for us, and in the process of doing that we need to be asking, well, what helps that process? What feeds that process? How does that expansion come about? How does the heart grow in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>? We need to be asking those questions and also asking, what blocks it? What starves it? What gets in the way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > What helps what blocks loving-kindness" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#What helps what blocks loving-kindness" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^1-1

And so very broadly speaking, just the repetition of the phrases, on the cushion, in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">walking meditation</a></span>, just having <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a></span> in that level of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a></span> the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a></span> the heart - hugely significant. And just over and over again, we are retraining the intentionality in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and the heart. And sometimes, when the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ itself is there, that, too, is a way in which the heart's capacity increases<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Faith in reconditioning mind and heart by just repeting the phrases; samadhi" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Faith in reconditioning mind and heart by just repeting the phrases; samadhi" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2

There are many ways this happens. Some are on the cushion in full <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> and some informal. So how we act, how we speak, what we choose, how we are in our interactions - that's feeding the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ as well. And we need to inquire into that - as important what happens outside of formal <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> as it is inside. And then, within formal <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>, sometimes it feels like it's going well, okay? It feels good. There's the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ there - great, lovely, and put a lot of emphasis on this, inclining towards that. So this is why we keep saying about the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> sensitivity. And you drop a word in or a phrase, and it has some resonance in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> sensitivity, or the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> feels peaceful, there's a feeling of peace around, there's a feeling of warmth, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> - actually connecting with that in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, feeling it, feeling just a sense of comfort in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, just a vague, unremarkable sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span>. That connection with those kinds of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span> in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> helps the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_. It allows the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a></span> to go deeper. And in so doing, the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ kind of gets into the cells, becomes, in a very deep way, part of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span>, a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> for the being, a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> for the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> via the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and via the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Body sensitivity allows samadhi to go deeper" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Body sensitivity allows samadhi to go deeper" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3

And sometimes, it doesn't feel to be going well. It feels like there's no feeling, I'm even irritated or whatever, aversive, there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> around, whatever it is - doesn't feel like it's going well. That's fine too. And what we said right at the beginning: just keep having <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a></span> in this planting of the seeds with the phrases, just planting the seeds of intention. Not to jump too much into judging one's practice, by whether it feels like it's going well or whether it feels like it's going badly. There's too much going on, so to speak, underneath the radar, in the darkness of what is not conscious, and we have to kind of respect that and have some <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a></span> in the process<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > If it doesnt feel to be going well just keep having faith" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#If it doesn't feel to be going well just keep having faith" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4

I can't remember if I said this already in here, but when a farmer or a gardener plants a seed, the germination of that seed, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span> of that seed goes on underneath the ground, in the darkness, invisible. And it's very similar with the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice. There's a lot going on at levels we don't actually have access to. To trust that. So there is certainly the fact of the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ deepening and expanding through the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_, but also deepening and expanding through just this patient <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a></span> in the planting of the seeds<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Simile gardener having faith that the seed grows underground" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Simile gardener having faith that the seed grows underground" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-5
###### 2-1
What I want to go into today is the relationship of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> and the deepening of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and the deepening of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. So on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, what we talk about - and we've already started, and it kind of gets more and more as it goes on - is the way that the practices of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> actually bring <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, as part of what they bring. They bring a liberating <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. They bring <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> that frees. This is not the usually understood way of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, but it's there. And as we practise <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> comes with that - _can_ come with that. It's a possibility<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > As we practice metta insight comes with that" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#As we practice metta insight comes with that" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
What I want to talk about today is the other way round: how it might be that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> feeds <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. So I'm talking about the ways <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> can be fed: in our lives, in our interactions, in the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_, through the patient planting of the seeds, and now just this piece about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> leading to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > It works the other way around as well insight feeds loving-kindness and compassion" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#It works the other way around as well insight feeds loving-kindness and compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2

Sometimes we can be doing this practice, and we feel as if we are creating the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_. You're sort of sitting and huffing and puffing and squeezing and ... [laughs] And if you're lucky, you know, a drop of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_. It feels like it's something <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a></span>, created, which it _is_, on one level. But sometimes we might ask ourselves a question: is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> something created? Now, actually it _is_, but are _we_ creating it? What's actually going on there? Or is it maybe the case that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> may be the natural state and a natural expression when the heart, when the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> is not entangled or obscured or clouded by <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and by <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>? It's much more as if one is _uncovering_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and _uncovering_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. So that's an interesting question: what's actually going on here? Are we creating it? Or are we _uncovering_ it? Are we _allowing_ it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Are we creating metta or are we uncovering it" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Are we creating metta or are we uncovering it" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^2-3

When we talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a></span>, it's a very good question to ask: what does that mean? What is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>? What is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a></span>? <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a></span> is an <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> - so either intellectual or intuitive, any kind of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> - that releases <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, and in so doing, releases <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. So that the mark of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> is this release of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. That's how you know that what's going on is an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Suffering</a></span> either goes completely or just lessens to some degree because of some <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of seeing</a></span> or some way of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a></span> releases <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, and in releasing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, the struggling, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a></span>, the pulling, the holding on, the identifying - any form of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> - <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> releases the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. And because it releases the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is released<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Insight is any kind of understanding that releases clinging and thus suffering" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Insight is any kind of understanding that releases clinging and thus suffering" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4

When the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> talked about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a></span>, there's a number of ways of interpreting it. One way would be that it's just kind of sitting around, or watching what's going on, and trying not to _do_ much. [laughs] And hopefully out of that, _budoom_, up comes an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, which is perfectly valid, to an extent. [laughter] But sometimes we might find, you're watching your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>, or just, you know ... [huffing and puffing] "In, out, in, out, arising, falling, arising, falling," and _hoping_ that out of that, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> cracks into the being. Or just trying to sit there doing nothing, and again the hope, the assumption is that in that 'doing nothing,' an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> will be born. There is definitely something to that, and in a way - I'm not putting it in very attractive terms, but it's actually a very beautiful approach to practice<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Insight from not doing much or doing nothing at all" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Insight from not doing much or doing nothing at all" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-5
###### 2-6
Oftentimes, though, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> talks about another approach, which is more, "Can we practise <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a></span> and ways of relating?" So what he means when he talks about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> is _practising_ certain <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span> at <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> in the moment, _practising_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span> that bring release, that let go of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. So we typically look in ways that actually lead to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, lead to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. That's what we do all the time. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> said, "Can you learn to look in different ways that bring release?" Release of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> brings release from <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and that brings <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. That brings <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Alternative practice ways of looking that bring release" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Alternative practice ways of looking that bring release" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-6

So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, practising ways of [seeing] - I'll go into what I mean. I'm talking a little bit abstractly. I realize that it might sound a little abstract right now. I'll explain what I mean as I go through today. Practising <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a></span> and relating that bring <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>, release, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. And what I want to go into today is, is it possible (and these are just possibilities) that we can incorporate some of those <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>, some of those practices, into the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice itself, so that we've kind of got a refining of the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice that's possible, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice that's possible? I'll explain what I mean<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > This talk is about incorporating some of those ways of looking into metta practice" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#This talk is about incorporating some of those ways of looking into metta practice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1

In a way, I sort of want to start by going off on a bit of a tangent. But it always seems relevant on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, so I'm going to do it again. And that has to do with - to speak a little bit about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. So <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> actually is an example of a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> or a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a></span> is actually a species of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> that blocks <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a></span> blocks <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. And to investigate this in our lives. Is that the case, that when we're afraid there's a kind of closing of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>? And we might notice - if you pay <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, you might notice that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> have this kind of inverse relationship. Originally, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> offered the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice to a group of monks who were really, really afraid in the forest. That was his initial offering as an antidote and as a response to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>.^[According to the commentary to the _Sutta Nipāta_, the Buddha taught the _Mettā Sutta_ (Sn 1:8) as a protective discourse to a group of monks who were experiencing frightening visions and sounds produced by hostile deities. See Bhikkhu Bodhi, tr., _The Suttanipāta: An Ancient Collection of the Buddha's Discourses Together with Its Commentaries_ (Boston: Wisdom, 2017), 566-7] But we might notice in our lives that when <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is strong, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is weak. And when <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is strong, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is weak. They have this inverse relationship. And conversely, we might also notice, in ourselves and in the world, when <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is strong, violence - either a psychological or a physical violence - is strong. It goes with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>.

So I want to say a little bit about working with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, because often it _does_ come up in the context of a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> like this anyway for people. And working with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> would usually come under the umbrella of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a></span>, learning to work with that. I mentioned in one of the talks (I think it was the talk on _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_): sometimes in a practice like this - we're sitting, walking - _something_ feels like it's deepening and opening. And maybe just isolated moments, or little stretches of time or whatever, the being, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, finds itself in territory that's unfamiliar: much more open, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span> have changed a little bit, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> feels different, the sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a></span> feels different, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> feels different, maybe dramatically so, maybe just a little bit. And this can bring up <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Samadhi can bring up fear" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Samadhi can bring up fear" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3

And very, very skilful to learn, if the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is not too strong, then actually one has a choice in that moment. With that opening, the opening of the being, the opening of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, there will be some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a></span> with that, alongside the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. And this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a></span> coexist. What usually happens is we get sucked into the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, and like a magnet, we go into the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. We get pulled into it and spun around by it, with it. Sometimes it's possible just to sit back a little bit and have a look: I've got this pleasant <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, there's openness, there's warmth, etc. There's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span>, and there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. And learn - and this is a skill, it's a practice - learn to incline the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> towards what's enjoyable in there. So in that openness, there _will_ be something that's enjoyable. It's an acquired taste to learn how to dip in a little bit, dip in. You can be in control of this. You can dip into what's enjoyable and not give so much <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. You don't have to ignore it, but you also don't have to feed it by getting obsessed with it and worried about it and drawn into it. So this is a practice, but it's actually very important, when the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is not that strong<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > When the fear is not that strong you can dip into whats enjoyable and not give so much attention to the fear" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#When the fear is not that strong you can dip into what's enjoyable and not give so much attention to the fear" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-4

But sometimes, of course, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> does feel stronger. Or it feels like we're unable to do that. And sometimes we get very strong <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, maybe in the context of a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> and, of course, outside a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. When we look at <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, we have to ask, what actually is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>? What is the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>? It's an interesting one - or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span>. And when we look, what do we see in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>? So oftentimes we don't hang out with it long enough to actually unpack it and see what's there. What we notice with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is usually unpleasant <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a></span> - in the extreme, the heart is pounding, the tummy is in knots or butterflies. Unpleasant <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> sensation, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> to the physical sensations. We don't like them. We want to get rid of them. That's there alongside the unpleasant sensations. So <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > When the fear is stronger ask what actually is fear Body sensations" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#When the fear is stronger ask what actually is fear Body sensations" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-1

Thoughts. Often thoughts, and often future thoughts, associated with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, and unpleasant thoughts about what's going to happen or what might happen. Thoughts associated with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, as part of the constellation of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, and again, their unpleasantness, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> to them, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> to that. So there are the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a></span> and the thoughts, and in each case there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Thoughts also have aversion associated with them" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Thoughts also have aversion associated with them" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-2

Third factor, a little more subtle, with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is the kind of climate of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, the inner texture of the way the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> feels. And when there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> around, it shrinks. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> shrinks. It gets small. You notice this with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>? The actual <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> feels like it's constricting. That, generally speaking, is unpleasant. Human beings don't like a constricted <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>. And so, again, it being unpleasant, there's going to be <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> to it: I want to get rid of it. I want it to go away. So there's the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, the thoughts, and the texture, the climate of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, and correspondingly, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> to that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Inner texture of the mind shrinks when theres fear around" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Inner texture of the mind shrinks when there's fear around" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-3

These aversions are very important to investigate, because when we ask, "What's my relationship with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>?" - and this is a fundamental <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> question, "What's my relationship with _anything_?" - usually the relationship with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is, we're afraid of it. We're actually afraid of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. We have <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. This is part of what makes <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>_. It's that we're actually afraid of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> itself. As our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation practice</a></span>, in general, develops over time, we learn to - we _can_ learn to accommodate that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>: the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, the thinking <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, and the texture of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. We learn to just bring <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> to it and just to be with it. And what we get, slowly, over time, is a sense of confidence that it's just some unpleasant sensations, just some unpleasant thoughts: "I can be with this. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a></span> can hold it." What's almost always lacking with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is confidence. We don't feel confident that we can actually be with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> and accommodate it, and be okay with it. With practice, bringing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> to all of it, we just see: it's just that, and it's accommodatable. Confidence comes. It's hugely significant<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > We are afraid of fear but we can be with this which brings confidence" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We are afraid of fear but we can be with this which brings confidence" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-4

So usually our relationship with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is one of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> or fleeing. We want to get away from, run away from the unpleasantness of it. But that very <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> and fleeing makes the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> increase. This <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, is part of the whole constellation. It's part of the whole mechanism and wheel of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. It makes it more difficult.

There's more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> in the thinking. There are already unhelpful, unskilful, unpleasant thoughts in the thinking, looping around. You've just injected a whole lot of extra <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> in there because one is fleeing. And it increases, actually feeding the whole fire of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Fear of fear feeds the fire of the fear" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Fear of fear feeds the fire of the fear" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-5

So the reaction that we have to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is not something separate from the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> itself. They're not two separate things. The reaction is part of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span> itself. So you can check this out. They're not two separate things. If we can soften that reaction or take away that reaction somewhat, what we'll notice is that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> cannot support itself. It cannot support itself. So not to take this on authority just because I say it or someone else says it. See if one can experiment with this when <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is around. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a></span> needs me to be aversive and reactive to it. The reaction is part of the mechanism. What happens when I soften that reaction? <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a></span> cannot support itself without me fearing it, without me reacting to it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Fear needs me to be aversive and reactive to it" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Fear needs me to be aversive and reactive to it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1

Sometimes our relationship with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is putting pressure - part of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> - pressure on it to be different. It's all the same: it's fuel for the fire of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. So to be aware of these mechanisms, to see, "Can they be relaxed? Can I soften them?" Or judging myself - if I judge myself that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is around, again, it's fuel for the fire. What am I assuming about myself because there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> around? What am I assuming about my practice? That I'm a failure, that it's rubbish, that I'm not getting anywhere - just because <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is around? That's also something that we're injecting into the moment that's building the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Self-judgement is also fuel for the fire of fear" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Self-judgement is also fuel for the fire of fear" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2

And there is enough <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, and then what people think of me becomes _almost_ insignificant. This is very real, and as I said, it's quite a rare maturity that actually lives that out in one's life, through one's practice.

And also in the relationship to the present. Is the relationship to the present one of openness, of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>, of curiosity, of interest, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>? When the relationship to the present has those qualities in it, the future takes care of itself, just moment by moment. Those two pieces - cultivating what's beautiful, and taking care of the relationship with the present - the future is taken care of in the deepest way. And in a very real way, we come to worry less about, "Will there be enough money later on? Will there be security? Will I be okay in terms of a house? What will happen in terms of, will I find a partner? Will my partner die? Will they stay with me? Will I be alone?" All that stuff, not that it's not important stuff in our lives, but its hold on us, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> that oftentimes is around - we don't even realize it's around, running our lives, running our choices. How much of that stuff is actually dictating our choices in our life? And we don't even register it as a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. And that stuff just begins to get less because of the power of cultivating what's beautiful, over time. And this is something very real. It's not theoretical, and it's not unrealistic. It's something very, very real that can come into the being, into one's life in a very real, very practical way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Taking care of the relationship with the present" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Taking care of the relationship with the present" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-2

What I want to explore in the remaining part of the talk is this way that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> practices can potentially be used as a kind of background within the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice. I want to offer some possibilities. Really just hear them as that: _optional_ possibilities. So for some people, this will be very interesting, very applicable, and fascinating. For other people, it will just be, "Okay, doesn't really attract me. It doesn't seem to have much to do with me." It's fine, but I want to put them out there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Optional insight practices as a background within the metta practice" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Optional insight practices as a background within the metta practice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-4

So these are just some of the possibilities, and I think I want to go through - I think there are seven here [**(_i_)-(_vii_)** below]. I mentioned the other day, in the talk the other night, as we do the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice, in a very non-linear way, there can be a deepening. And there can be a sense, at times, of merging, and the heart merging with the heart of another, or a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> opening up - _can_ be, at times, for some people. When we talk about _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_ - and John talked the other day about _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_, and I touched on it - when we talk about that, it's actually not the same as <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>. It's something a little bit different. But that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> is still really important when it comes<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > There can be a sense of oneness opening up" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#There can be a sense of oneness opening up" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-5

**(2) _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a></span>_**, which means 'unsatisfactory.' So all things, again, are not capable of bringing lasting satisfaction.

Unfortunately, there's a whole current in the teaching that's gone on for about 2,000 years [laughter] and it's still very alive and healthy today, that actually says: "This _is_ bleak, and the more bleak and miserable you get from reflecting on it, the better."

###### 7-5
I pretty much completely disagree, and I don't think that's the way the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> intended it or meant it. They are <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>, skills in looking, that in looking bring - _should_ bring, if one's going about it the right way, _should_ bring a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. They're practices, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a></span>, lenses for looking at <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> in the moment that _should_ bring with them <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. And if they're not, if they don't, it means one needs to play with it, tinker with it, until one learns to contemplate that way, contemplate one of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="three characteristics" class="internal-link">three characteristics</a></span>, or all of them, in ways that actually bring <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. So it is unfortunate there is this - well, quite a number of strands in the traditions that really feel that one should have a kind of existential angst, or trembling, or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, or misery, or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="depression" class="internal-link">depression</a></span>, or kind of _blah_, or whatever.

Anyway, so these <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="three characteristics" class="internal-link">three characteristics</a></span>, what I want to go into, this is just a framework for what I'm talking about, these possibilities which may or may not be interesting to you. And if they're not, that's really fine. And one can keep doing the basic practices - absolutely fine. But also want to put out there a sense of how deep these practices of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> can actually go. They're almost - not infinite, but an incredible depth of refinement and subtlety that can come into this practice.

**(_i_)** At one level, what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> meant, what he talked about, is **remembering <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> - remembering <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> and the unpredictability of life**. So we can be doing the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice, and one's directing, attempting to direct the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ towards another being and just holding, in the background of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, just a light reflection on the fact of their mortality: "They will die. Like all of us, they will die." Now, remember, as I just said, it shouldn't be bleak. It shouldn't be depressing, so only to use this if it feels like it's actually unlocking some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> in the heart. If one introduces it and it just feels like, "Ugh, gosh," a terrible <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, or morbidity or a paralysis comes in, leave it. But you may find that just giving the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ to the benefactor, giving the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ to the neutral person, whoever it is, difficult person, and one just reflects, "They are subject to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>. They are subject to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>." Very likely, they don't know _when_ they're going to die. Not just <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, but they're also subject to the whole range of what this word _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">anicca</a></span>_ means: uncertainty, change. And our life involves an incredible amount of uncertainty and change. That's the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span>, that's the fabric of our existence. And they, like us, are subject to that. So just holding this lightly, this sense of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">anicca</a></span>_ that they are vulnerable to, holding that in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> very lightly, as one's doing the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, can either kick-start the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ when it feels like it's a little bit blocked or it can't really get off the ground, or deepen it at times when it already feels like it's going<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > a Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#a Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-2

**(_ii_)** There are a few more with this, just within this realm of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>. Another one in relation to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, and it's actually more subtle and perhaps more difficult for people. I'm not sure. Practising - again, all this is practice - **practising learning to see _this moment_ in the context of our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>**. So I'll explain what I mean. Science, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmology</a></span>, tells us that the universe is 13.7 billion years old - pretty old - and that it will last as least as long. Actually, its future is a little bit uncertain, but ... [laughter] It's either going to collapse back again after about the same amount of time, or keep going, don't know - long, long stretches of time. Our life within that is what? Fifty, seventy, ninety, a hundred years, if one's lucky. And there's a sense - you can practise with, you can play with this sometimes - having a sense of one's life and the lives of others being a very small, a _tiny_ span in the vastness of time, and a vastness of space. And if possible, you can even bring that into the moment<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > b Having a sense of ones life as a tiny span in the vastness of time and space" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#b Having a sense of one's life as a tiny span in the vastness of time and space" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-3

So right now, right now, in this moment, there is a moment of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> going on. [snaps fingers] What's happening? There's visual form, there's colour, there's sound, there's sight, there's a moment of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> - and it's almost like putting that in the context of this incredible vastness of time. We don't know what came before our life. We don't know what comes after, no matter what all the theories, including the Buddhist theories, say. There's _this moment_ in the context of a massive, almost unfathomably unthinkable unknown. And you can toy with this playing of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. Something comes: this moment, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, and vastness. And again, instead of unlocking <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, sometimes it can unlock more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>.

**(_iii_)** What's most common when we talk about - or in the tradition, when people talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> and the contemplation of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, is **trying to look, in the moment, at quite a rapid, moment-to-moment <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a></span>**. So every moment, there's something new. Every moment, a thought arises, a moment, a sound, a this, a that. And then when we pay <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, we see <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a></span> arising, passing quite rapidly.

And one notices, all I see in the moment is change. There's just a moment of this [snaps fingers], a moment of that [snaps fingers], a moment - I can't find anything in there that's 'me.' So this is the way <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> feeds into an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_ and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>.

We have a sense of a fixed, independent, solid, lasting self. But when I look closely at my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, what I notice is change, change, change. There's nothing I can find that I can point to and say, "Well, _that's_ what my lasting, fixed self is." All I see is change, and the question is, "_Where_ am I? Who am I?" And when I look at the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Present moment" class="internal-link">Present moment</a></span>, there's a way that the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> can become much more permeable, less solid. All I'm noticing is just moments of change. I can't find this solid self. And there's the possibility, in the context of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice, to open up that way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > All I see in the moment is change not a lasting fixed self" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#All I see in the moment is change not a lasting fixed self" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-1

And what _can_ happen, again, instead of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a></span> and all that, is it deepens the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. It can deepen or kick-start the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> - this sense of, "Actually, I can't find anything here that's permanent." Now, you could also contemplate another person, and contemplate, "There's nothing to find _there_ that's permanent." And this is where it starts to get a little strange, because we tend to think of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> being between self and other. And as we go into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, we find less and less of one. We find less and less solidity. And in that very moment of finding less solidity, instead of the whole <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> crumbling because we feel, "Well, who's giving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> to whom?" [laughter] If I don't find anything here - I don't find any object to give it to - the opposite can happen. And almost paradoxically, there's a deepening of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. Less self, less _other_ self to give the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> to, and somehow, there's a deepening of the quality of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> - _can_ be. Remember, all this is just actually very rapidly painting a whole range of possibilities.

**(_iv_)** There's another one, and this is really quite subtle, this one. So I'm not going in any particular order of difficult or subtle or whatever, but ... point to it.

Change, change, change, change, change. Can't find anything that's not changing. What do I find, though, when I look, and I look for myself? All I see, all I can find, are <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > d In all the change all what I can find are perceptions" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#d In all the change all what I can find are perceptions" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-3

When I look inside, that's all I can find. Can't find anything that's not a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. It's not possible. Can't find anything that's not a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. A <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> needs the world. So, to perceive the carpet, I need for that to be there. **All I find when I look for myself are <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>, and those <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span> are not separate from the universe, from the world**. We tend to think of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> as something separate and independent. When I look for it, all I find are <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>, which are actually inseparable from the rest of the universe. They are inseparable. This is quite a subtle point. It's not an easy point either to understand or to work with in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>, but I want to mention it. I find nothing but <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>, and they are inseparable, and in a way, it's seeing - it's a way that this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> can lead to an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>.

**(_v_)** So now this one is back to a relatively simple way of going about things. Just to realize: <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is part of life. Okay? <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Suffering</a></span> comes into everyone's life, in all kinds of ways and all kinds of levels. This is just a fact of our existence. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Four Noble Truths" data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">First Noble Truth</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> said: "There is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_." There is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and a whole range of it and a whole breadth of it. And sometimes we're doing the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ - and later on, all this applies to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice as well, and we'll move on to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> next week - **one is doing the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice, and just to drop in, directing it to someone else, just to drop in, "We are all in the same boat. We are all in the same boat with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>."** So, this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> experiences <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. That <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, experiences <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, experiences <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, experiences discomfort, experiences illness at times, will <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>. Some of these blend into each other. But just to reflect - you can just drop this in or have it as a light background to help the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, or kick-start the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_: "We're all in the same boat. We all share these encounters with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in our life. We all meet <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in all kinds of ways - through the difficulties we have in relationship, and circumstance, and life, and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, internally in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>." To bring that in as ways of feeding, deepening, injecting some life sometimes into the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice. So we're all in the same boat. (It's not a great phrase, but you know what I mean.) ^10-3
###### 10-4
**(_vi_)** Second one, still in the realm of this characteristic of _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_: If, at some point, either on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> or another <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, if you **just lightly put your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> in the chest area - in the heart <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span>, the heart chakra, whatever you want to call it - you just lightly keep the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> there, and you notice how it opens and closes.** The actual sense, energetically, or even subtly physically, of the heart, heart <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span>, opens and closes. And it _will_ open and close many times in a day, countless times in our life. Opens and closes. **If you just have a light <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> and interest there to when it's open and when it's closed, the heart <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span>, what you notice is: when there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, guess what? [laughs] Closed, no entry! When we release <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, the heart <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> opens.** Now, you can actually feel this. This is, again, why I keep going on about the sensitivity to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. You can actually feel this: the heart <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> opening and closing. It may not be that dramatic, so we may not be talking about colossal differences of opening and closing, but just little movements, and notice the relationship with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. Why did the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> go on and on and on and on about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>? <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a></span> brings <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a></span> closes the heart. Releasing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> brings <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>; it also brings <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. And we can notice this so we're crystal clear about it, and there's just no arguing about it. It's very, very clear to us. We feel it in the heart and in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > f feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#f feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-4

Now, the good news is, part of the good news is that we can learn to become sensitive to this movement, to notice when there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. By '<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>,' I mean <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a></span> what we don't like, over-identifying with things, trying to hold on to things, to grasp at things - all that is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. And we can begin to feel that and see this relationship, as I said, with the heart. And that when we release the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, the heart opens and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> comes. And we can develop over time - it's a gradual process - but we can develop our capacity to become sensitive to when there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> around<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > We can develop our capacity to become sensitive to when theres clinging around" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We can develop our capacity to become sensitive to when there's clinging around" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-1

So sometimes <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> is extremely obvious. You know, we're literally hanging on to someone's leg: "Don't go!

[laughter] It's obvious that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> is there. But <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> has an enormous range to it. Again, like all these <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> questions, it gets extremely subtle, extremely subtle. Part of the good news is that we can develop the subtlety of our sensitivity and be more and more aware of when <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> is there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Clinging has an enormous range to it" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Clinging has an enormous range to it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-2

Again, why do we keep going on about the sensitivity to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>? Because in this sensitivity to this region of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> field, this feeling field, as I develop the sensitivity to that, as I keep the sensitivity and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> there, that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> sense will reflect to me, will indicate to me when there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> around - holding, pushing, struggling, identifying - because some kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> and tension comes into the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Experience" data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">bodily experience</a></span>, even if it's very subtle. Even if it's very subtle - in the belly, in the shoulders, in the back, just very, very, subtly in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> - and that can be our indicator of when there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. And sometimes - even better news - we don't even know what we're <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> to, but just the releasing of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, the relaxing of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> sense, can release the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span> and open the heart<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > The body sense will indicate when theres clinging around" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#The body sense will indicate when there's clinging around" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-3

So to say a bit about this, this **'<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>'** teaching - it's really, really important to realize that, in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma practice</a></span>, we're not setting out to destroy <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, to explode <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, to erase <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, even to dissolve <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> or to merge the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> with some cosmic being or cosmic sense of something. The other day I mentioned <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> in the talk, and the possibility of this sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>. And sometimes there _can_ be a sense of the being opening and merging with something and a real sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>. That's really beautiful, really precious, and really, really helpful. But it's still - it's a little bit different from this _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_ business. It's extremely valuable, if and when it happens, to open to that, and have that change of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, and feel the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> of that, and feel touched by that. But _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_ is something different, and it's _not_ that that is what we're going for in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > 3 Anatta not-self" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#3 Anatta not-self" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-6

_<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anattā</a></span>_ is, really, we want to understand something about the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, understand it in a way that brings <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>. We want to understand something about what <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> is, and how it is, in a way that brings <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> into our life. So going back to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> for a second, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> is based on this self-notion. Without belief in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, there can't really be <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. Where is the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> going to take root? It's around self. When we begin to understand, deeply and in the heart, this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of self, we realize there's actually nothing real here to protect, to defend, to worry about, and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> gets released at a very deep level in our lives<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > We want to understand something about what the self is and how it is in a way that brings freedom into our life" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We want to understand something about what the self is and how it is in a way that brings freedom into our life" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-1

So we want to understand something about self, and it's actually not easy to understand, this teaching of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_. It's really not easy. I've never encountered anyone who gets it right away.

So it's tantalizing as a teaching. We hear it, and we sort of get it, and we want to understand it, and we get frustrated sometimes. Sometimes we grab hold of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> in a bit of the wrong way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Anatta is difficult to grasp fully" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Anatta is difficult to grasp fully" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-2

There's a story from the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Judaism" data-href="Judaism" class="internal-link">Jewish tradition</a></span>, and it's Yom Kippur, which in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Judaism" data-href="Judaism" class="internal-link">Jewish tradition</a></span> is the holiest day of the year. It's the day of atonement, when you bare yourself to God, and you reflect on the year that's passed, and all the ways that you haven't lived up to your aspirations, and the goodness of being that God is asking of you, etc. And it's Yom Kippur, and a very serious, holy atmosphere in the synagogue. And the rabbi is there, and suddenly the rabbi sinks to his knees and starts beating his chest: "I am nothing, I am nothing, I am nothing." And a little while later, the cantor, the guy who leads the singing, sinks to his knees: "I am nothing, I am nothing, I am nothing." And then a little while after that, the janitor, the person who cleans the toilets, sinks to his knees: "I am nothing, I am nothing, I am nothing." And the cantor turns to the rabbi and says, "Look who thinks he's nothing!" [laughter] There's a way we can actually make more self out of this question of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>.

**(vii)** What's the way in relation to _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_? He wants you to practise a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. We _can_ **practise a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> - regarding our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> as 'not me' and 'not mine,' '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>.'** So typically, typical human <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, something comes up, something comes into our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> - a thought, an emotion, a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> sensation - and we regard it, without even thinking about it, oftentimes, without even realizing that we're doing it, sometimes, we regard it as 'me': "I _am_ that emotion. That's _how I am_. That's _who_ I am." Or 'mine': "That thought belongs to me. This <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> sensation belongs to me. This <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> belongs to me." The whole range of it, we identify, either identify or take ownership of. This is going on 99.9 per cent of the time of our waking and dreaming life. An incredible current of habitually identifying with, taking as 'me' or 'mine' our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, and particularly the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">five aggregates</a></span> which John talked about: **(_a_)** the **<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>**, **(_b_)** the **feeling-tone** of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, **(_c_)** our **<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>**, **(_d_)** the whole range of our **mental thoughts and formations**, and moods and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind state" data-href="Mind state" class="internal-link">mind states</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>, and **(_e_)** the **<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>** itself, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> itself<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > g Aggregates are not me not mine" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#g Aggregates are not me not mine" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-5

And - sometimes deliberately, sometimes we realize we're doing it; most of the time we don't - we're saying, "Me. Mine. This is me. This is mine." And the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> is saying, can you practise - it's a gradual thing to develop this practice - can you practise seeing it in the moment, as 'not me, not mine'? So a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> sensation comes up, and it's 'just happening.' A thought comes up and it's 'just happening.' It's 'not me, not mine.' And one learns to actually look at the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> through a lens - instead of the lens of 'me, mine, me, mine, me, mine' - **look at the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> through a lens of 'it's just happening, it's not me, it's not mine.'** It's a practice. And again, what happens? It may seem paradoxical. What happens? <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> are liberated in that way of relating. I'm talking about very real possibilities for practice. And again, for those with that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> or have got that way of practising already, you can drop that in as a backdrop for the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice. So you open the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> up and just regard things as 'just happening,' as 'not me, not mine,' and into the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> comes more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Look at experience through a lens of its just happening" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Look at experience through a lens of it's just happening" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-1

One of the particular areas where we get entangled, and certainly on a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">meditation retreat</a></span>, is self-judgment. So something comes up for us, or our practice feels difficult, or we're sitting here doing _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, and then we get irritation, or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, or some negative thoughts, and we judge that. We judge ourselves, and we measure ourselves: "How am I doing? How is my practice going?" Very normal. That measuring and judging and comparing is actually part of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of what self does. The way self builds itself is through judging, measuring, comparing, and evaluating<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Self-judgement" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Self-judgement" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-2
###### 13-3
So to recognize that it's going to be part of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. It's going to be part of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. The question is, how can I relate to it in a way that's most helpful? That's a whole other subject, but first of all, one of the ways is just to keep doing the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_. And realize that we have a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> of judging, of measuring ourselves, of comparing, of evaluating, and just to keep doing the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ is taking away the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> from that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> pattern and feeding what's more helpful: the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ to our self. But also, sometimes, to just see that these thoughts that we're judging, or this state of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, it's like they arise out of nowhere. They're 'just happening.' They're 'not me, not mine.' We take them to be 'me' or 'mine.' They're like a shooting star in the sky, in the night sky: it just appears out of nowhere and then disappears. The more we can begin to see things that way, the less identification, and the less dragged down we are in self-judgment, self-criticism, comparing, measuring, evaluating ourselves. So this is really a practice that we can develop<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > With metta you take away the energy from the pattern of self-judging" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#With metta you take away the energy from the pattern of self-judging" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-3

And one can do this business with the non-ownership of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a></span>, you can do it with another being. So again, you're directing the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ to another being, and just say, "_Their_ <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> doesn't belong to them.

It's just stuff happening, stuff arising." And again, you get this sense of not much of a giver of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, not much of a receiver of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, and yet it deepens it, can deepen it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Seeing the non-ownership of the aggregates can be also done with another being" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Seeing the non-ownership of the aggregates can be also done with another being" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-4

And so I had a go at practising this _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_ thing. And I found that I couldn't hold both. It felt too - it feels like _both_ are true, and so, I found I couldn't hold both. I couldn't actually hold the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_ for very long. So I went back; I tried to find a sort of slightly less _fixed_ way. But I'm just interested in, okay, there are different ways of viewing self, so how ...? You said something about things coexisting, and for me they didn't. The two of those didn't kind of exist that way. So how do you work with ...? ^14-8
###### 14-9
Rob: Good. So in other words, the two - you couldn't do both, meaning you couldn't keep the sense of their self and also the sense of their <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>? Yeah, okay, thank you. Very important. So, anything is good. Anything is game in this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> - well, within certain parameters, but ... [laughter] In other words, whatever feels helpful at a certain time. So your initial thing was, "Let's make them a bit more real, a bit more ..." And in a way, we make things real by fixing them in certain ways. What you could do, just on that level, is - I remember years ago, in a class, someone was playing with dressing their - I can't remember if it was their neutral person - dressing them up in different outfits. [laughter] And so, if you've got a visual imagination, you actually picture them in different outfits. And if you want, there can be quite a range of those outfits that gives them a range of - it doesn't fix them. So anything from army fatigues to sort of what one would wear - an ascot or something, and sort of hats with ... you know. I'm being silly, but you can play with how you see them just on a very mundane level. In other words, you said, "Oh, I'm fixing them in this kind of character, or this is how they do things." Maybe just broaden that. You _don't_ know, and just imagine them some other way. You understand<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > We can make things real by fixing them in a certain ways like dressing them up in different outfits" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We can make things real by fixing them in a certain ways like dressing them up in different outfits" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^14-9
###### 15-1
This other part - you're quite right. What you find, if you do this enough, if you work with the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_ of someone, is that {quote as you contemplate someone's non-fixedness of self, their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> of self, they actually begin, in your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, they begin to blur. And you can't fix them and hold them. So that's actually really good. It's great. Now, two things can happen. One is, with that, there can still be a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. It doesn't seem so fixed and so directed, but you just follow that sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, and you stay with the sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, and don't worry so much about exactly where you're directing it, okay? Does that make sense<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > As you contemplate the emptiness of someone they begin to blur" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#As you contemplate the emptiness of someone they begin to blur" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^15-1
###### 15-2
Yogi: I just lost them. They became completely blurred, and I just lost them. ^15-2
###### 15-3
Rob: Yeah. So I'm saying one option is - I'm going to give you two options. One option is to let them become lost and blurred. And either, like I was saying in the talk the other day, _they_ become blurred, but a sense of heart or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> or _being_ is still there ... No? Okay, not even that. Was there a sense of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ there at all<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > A sense of hear or being can still be there" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#A sense of hear or being can still be there" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^15-3
###### 15-4
Yogi: At that point, no. I just kind of went back to ... [?] ^15-4
###### 15-5
Rob: Okay. What you may find, sometimes, is that the person becomes blurred, the sense of them becomes blurred, but there's still a sense of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, and you can just feel into that and keep with that. And it's fine; you just have a vague sense of their beingness, or maybe _very,_ very vague, _very_, very blurred. But there's just a sense of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ that doesn't seem to have so much of an object. That's fine. That's actually good, and just to be in that _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ that doesn't seem to have so much a sense of an object. Okay, that's one option<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > 1 As the sense of the person becomes blurred you can still feel into a sense of metta" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#1 As the sense of the person becomes blurred you can still feel into a sense of metta" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-5
###### 15-6
The other option, and this takes probably some practice, is that you can kind of _play_ - you will eventually find that you can play with how _formed_ you make someone. So you can play with kind of going into that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, but not too much, so you still keep them around a bit. You kind of see that they're empty, but you also don't go too far into that - you can kind of pull them back and forth on this sliding scale of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. It might sound completely unreal, but it's actually a very real possibility. You can develop the control of that. So you kind of make them somewhat empty, but not <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">completely empty</a></span>, so you've still got a sense of somewhere you can direct the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ towards. If you've got that far in the playing, you'll probably find that it's just a matter of time before you can play with that. Does that make sense<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > 2 You can play with how formed you make someone" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#2 You can play with how formed you make someone" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^15-6

Yogi 2: Is that imagination? ^16-1
###### 16-2
Rob: Is that imagination? In what sense? ^16-2
###### 16-3
Yogi 2: I'm just wondering if that's not just visual imagination. ^16-3
###### 16-4
Rob: Oh. No, because it's coming out of a contemplation of their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. You're _seeing -_ rather than just sort of imaginally scrubbing someone out like that, you're actually reflecting on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of their being, reflecting on the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of their <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a></span>, etc. And it's that reflection, without trying to manipulate any <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> in any way - that itself. They begin to get much less defined. So it's something that's coming from a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of seeing</a></span> and a way of relating<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Its not visual imagination because its coming out of a contemplation of their emptiness" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#It's not visual imagination because it's coming out of a contemplation of their emptiness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-4

###### 16-6
Yogi: Thank you for your tangent on <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. That was very good and appropriate for me. And I realized the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>, I think, is in the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudra" data-href="Mudra" class="internal-link">mudrā</a></span>_ of teaching fearlessness. ^16-6
###### 16-7
Rob: Aha. I didn't know that. Thank you. Great. Good. ^16-7
###### 16-8
Yogi: I spoke to John about this; I asked whether this practice that we're doing can lead to fearlessness, or some elements of fearlessness, because - I mean, I personally find it very inhibitory, and also because of that, there are great losses attached to it. So thank you. ^16-8
###### 16-9
Rob: Good, you're welcome. As I said originally, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> introduced this whole practice to a group of monks who were living in the forest and very, very afraid, living in the sort of wilderness in the forest. It was originally an antidote to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>. So can it lead to fearlessness? Absolutely, absolutely<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Originally the Buddha introduced metta an an antidote to fear" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Originally the Buddha introduced metta an an antidote to fear" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-9

**Q4: availability of recordings** ^16-10
###### 16-11
Yogi: I just wanted to ask, the talks, are we able to get hold of them? ^16-11
###### 16-12
Rob: Yeah. That's this ... Just checking the microphone's on! [laughter] We haven't got a very good track record in this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> of recording, but yes, they will be available. ^16-12
###### 16-13
Yogi: Are they only available, like, to download? Or can we actually ... ^16-13
###### 16-14
Rob: No, I don't think they're actually available to download. There will be discs, and I think CD or MP3 is how they'll be available at the end of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and you can order. ^16-14
###### 17-1
Yeah. And that's actually a good point. In a talk like I gave today, partly - I don't know if it's sensible or not, but sometimes I feel like I'm almost ... There's so much information, and partly, in a way, one is giving it to the tape recorder, because I know it's too much to take in in one go. And one's bombarding - you've had instructions this morning already. And so it's almost like, "Yeah, take the tape, and just take a few pieces out." In a way, that's just going to give a lot of stuff that you can - you can go with this for years, years. You get to see, three weeks is a pretty short amount of time to investigate this stuff. You _could_ come for three months or three years, and you'd still be busy with the depth of all this and the range of all this. So it's really important that the tape is there, if you feel interested, and you begin to, "What was that thing he was going on about ...?" Or you're doing your best to pay <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, but it's just too much, just kind of going over the head right now. And that's one of the occupational hazards of this stuff. But I prefer to put a lot out, and hopefully people pick different pieces. But great that we have the tapes so that you _can_ refer back to them. Don't worry, as I said, if you feel like, "Oh gosh, I only got about 3 per cent of what you just said." It's totally fine<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > I prefer to put a lot out and hopefully people pick different pieces" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#I prefer to put a lot out and hopefully people pick different pieces" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-1

**Q5: writing notes during talks** ^17-2
###### 17-3
Yogi: And it's okay to write notes? ^17-3
###### 17-4
Rob: Totally okay to write notes as well. And actually, I like it when people write notes. Not that you have to, but it shows me that people are actually still awake. [laughter] Unless you're writing a shopping list or something. [laughter] It's very good. And it's an interesting thing, with a page of something, if we transcribe the talk, you can always just flip to that page, whereas with a talk you actually have to go through it in time, and it's hard to pull out the pieces - especially in a talk like today, which is basically a long, fat instruction talk, in a lot of respects. It's hard to pull out pieces when you have to go through a whole - whatever it was - an hour I talked for. Sometimes seeing it in a written page, you can just find that place, "Ah, that's exactly what I want." It's actually more helpful<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > If we transcribe the talk you can always just flip to that page" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#If we transcribe the talk you can always just flip to that page" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-4

**Q6: when to use <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> practices; responsiveness** ^17-5
###### 17-6
Yogi: The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> can only do one thing at the same time, right? ^17-6
###### 17-7
Rob: Uhh ... [laughs] Well, say a bit more. ^17-7
###### 17-8
Yogi: Another teacher suggested this, so on the _vipassanā_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> in India. So whatever you do, you move between one thing and another, somehow, like what you just asked about. Is it so or not? So that you can play around, and it doesn't actually fragment the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, as long as you play around with things that, together, those ingredients will support _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ somehow? ^17-8
###### 17-9
Rob: Can you be a bit more specific? ^17-9
###### 18-1
Yogi: No, I can't. I'm just wondering about, how can it work in such a way that when you offer all these elaborations - can they help you to come to a greater sense of wholeness more quickly somehow, because the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> deepens and the heart opens, right? And brings it together if the ingredients are right. Or is it so that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> can only do one thing at the same time? I think the question is, can the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> do more than one thing at the same time, if you're in _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_? Because somehow, when I am in a sense of wholeness, it seems like the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> can do anything; the thoughts can come in, and it doesn't bother me. Right? But if I'm not, and I'm already really scattered, or [?]. But to myself - or I was lost. You know, and it's all very fragmented. Is it then better not to invite all those elaborations? ^18-1
###### 18-2
Rob: Okay. I think I understand. It's interesting. Some people may hear some of what I've talked about today and say, "Well, my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is too scattered; I need to get the basics down." And there's something to say about that. When the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, as you say, has some degree of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_, some degree of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness</a></span>, it's much more malleable. We find, "Oh, I can play with this. I can pull this piece in. I can do more than one thing at once," because there's openness, there's presence, there's malleability in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. We can shape what's going on. But it may also be that we feel a bit unconnected, and the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ is not going very well, the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ is not going very well, and you pick up one of these pieces, and you just try doing that, and it actually helps to kick-start. So generally speaking, it's probably better to wait until there's some degree of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ and some degree of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness</a></span>, and you feel like, "It's going okay. Let me drop some of this in." But it may equally work that it just helps to kick-start when it feels a bit blocked. Can the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> do more than one thing at once? In _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_, you could say it could, yeah, when that's around. Yeah. So it's not going to this and then to this; it's more like, in the expanse of things, holding things together, and learning to do that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Its usually better to wait until theres some degree of samadhi before doing insight practice" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#It's usually better to wait until there's some degree of samadhi before doing insight practice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^18-2
###### 18-3
Yogi: Because it could lead to more fragmentation, or it could have the other effect. ^18-3
###### 18-4
Rob: It could. Yeah. And if it leads to more fragmentation, leave it, and come back to what's much simpler. So all of this, again, is in the context of responsiveness. You do something, and if it works, great. Do it more. Go for it. Do it deeper. Experiment. If you try something and it feels like, "Well, that took a nosedive," you know, go back to what's simpler, what's easier, what helps.

###### 18-8
Yogi: Rob, I've done, as you know, a little bit of using the phrase "not me, not mine" to look directly at <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. I was wondering, when you're doing the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_ sort of slant on _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, do you incorporate the phrase into the phrases of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_? "May - not me! - be happy ..." [laughter] ^18-8
###### 19-1
Rob: Careful you don't get it wrong - "May I _not_ be happy!" [laughter] It's a tricky one. You'll have to find what works. What I find is if you stay with just the "not me, not mine" as a very light thing, but let the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ phrases go, but keep the intention of the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ around. So it's like you're holding both things at once. It can seem very complicated, but it doesn't need to be. So you just drop the "not me, not mine" in, as a very, very [light] whisper of a phrase, in the context of the intention for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and wanting to feel when that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> is there, and then _feel_ the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. So you're interested in feeling the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> that comes out of it, but you can let the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ phrases go at that point, yeah. But experiment. I wouldn't put them in in the way of, "May - not me!" No, it's more - you might be down to just a word at that point, so "happy" or "peaceful," you know, and that's going on at the same time. But experiment and see. You may be doing the whole thing without any words at all, not even the "not me, not mine" or the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ phrases. A lot of this is playing, playing with it and finding out what happens. Is that enough? Yeah? Good, okay<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Drop in not me not mine very lightly wanting to feel the love" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Drop in not me not mine very lightly wanting to feel the love" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^19-1

Rob: Yeah, yeah.

You're absolutely not alone in that. Just to recognize, "That's how it is for me right now." Totally fine. It's more that the intention and the opening and the inclination towards _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ is being nourished.

Rob: Without the words? ^19-7
###### 19-8
Yogi: It's just, there are no words. ^19-8
###### 19-9
Rob: Yeah, sure. There can be more space, and more space in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, and that's easier. ^19-9
###### 19-10
Yogi: I just trip over my tongue, so to speak. ^19-10
###### 19-11
Rob: You may well, yeah. So you know what's good for you, and that's good, and you just go with that. Yeah. Just to trust yourself with that - yeah, I think that's important. To be enough in contact with one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> that one trusts, "This is working for me, and I know it is, and it's okay. And I trust that." That's really important, to trust one's own practice, what one sees and feels for oneself in one's own practice<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > You know whats good for you just go with that" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#You know what's good for you just go with that" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^19-11
###### 20-1
Yogi: But you've said before that _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ can kind of come from anywhere, like the head, the big toe, whatever. But again, I think, for me, it's getting out of the head that's the big one. ^20-1
###### 20-2
Rob: So this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> sensitivity that I've been talking about - it's very important. And putting the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, just gently keep putting it other places - belly, heart <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span>, etc. And the more you do that with that sensitivity, the more the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, the more the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> kind of rests there, takes its <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> there. And then it can radiate from there. That's great. Good<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Keep putting the awareness in other places than the head" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Keep putting the awareness in other places than the head" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^20-2

**Q9: interpreting and working with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Experience" data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">bodily experience</a></span> in different ways** ^20-3
###### 20-4
Yogi: I feel like my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> is lying to me. I had this lump in my throat, and now it has been there for three days. But now I'm thinking that I have only a sore throat! [laughter] But it's so much to believe that I'm doing really bad now. So do you have any suggestions for how to practise with it in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>? ^20-4
###### 20-5
Rob: I think so. What you're describing is actually really common. Something comes up in our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, particularly our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, and we tend to interpret it in a certain way, in the way we're looking at it. And in so doing, we perceive it a certain way, and that actually can become self-fulfilling. So sore throat - "Oh, feels like a lump in the throat." And then actually we _begin_ to feel miserable. I remember having a very irritated eye once, and tearing, and feeling sad. This was years ago. And there was nothing going on emotionally, but it was just, somehow the association of that physical sensation and the way I was looking at it and interpreting it. So, again, a couple of options<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Perceiving the body in a certain way can become self-fulfilling" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Perceiving the body in a certain way can become self-fulfilling" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^20-5
###### 20-6
One option is, actually, wipe the slate clean a little bit and say, "I don't _know_ what this thing is." And so it's possible sometimes to leave the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ and just approach the throat, just openly, and just be with those sensations. This is more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> practice territory, but just be with those sensations in a very light, very delicate way, so you're just holding them. And in a way, in the context of this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, you're just holding them in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>, and just letting them be there, but feeling into them, and seeing if it begins to tell you about an emotion or not. That's one option<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > 1 just be with those sensations" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#1 just be with those sensations" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^20-6
###### 20-7
The other option in the context of this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> is, "Okay, something going on in the throat - I'll put my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> elsewhere." And so, another area of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, maybe the heart area or the belly, may actually feel really okay, or comfortable, or even warm and open. And we keep getting dragged into what's a little bit problematic. Like a magnet, we go there. And if possible, just keeping it where it's okay. So they're kind of opposite suggestions, and you can play with them both. In the second one, it may be that you can find a place where it's okay, and actually just radiate the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ from there, or feel the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ from there. And eventually, it washes over everything<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > 2 put attention elsewhere" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#2 put attention elsewhere" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^20-7
###### 20-8
So it's important, I think, to keep open to them both, because sometimes there _is_ something going on emotionally, and we need to connect with it and hold it and explore it. Other times, it's just the way that we've gotten into perceiving and interpreting things, and we need to kind of go away from that. Does that answer? Yeah<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Keep open to both options" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Keep open to both options" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^20-8
###### 21-1
Yogi: Yeah, that makes sense. If my arm feels good, I just have to make my arms stronger? ^21-1
###### 21-2
Rob: That's one option. Rather than making them stronger, it's more like just letting the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> rest there, and enjoy that they feel good, rather than getting pulled into what feels difficult all the time. It's the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a></span> which allows the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> to kind of rest there and get into that more<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Its the attention and the enjoyment which allows the awareness to rest" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#It's the attention and the enjoyment which allows the awareness to rest" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^21-2

**Q10: concerns that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> might negate _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_; connecting with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> and seeing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> as two wings of practice** ^21-3
###### 21-4
Yogi: I was just thinking that part of my _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ practice is to introduce or open up just more to my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span>. I was just a bit concerned that if I introduce, along with that, the recognition that this is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span> or this is <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span>, that might negate that process somehow. Maybe the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ itself could be negated. ^21-4
###### 21-5
Rob: Right. Yeah. Very important question. Again, kind of stepping back and taking a big view. If we think, "What's involved in this life of practice? What's involved in the long run in terms of practice?" One wing of it is learning how to open to ourselves, learning how to open to our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> - how to be with them, how to acknowledge them, how to feel them, how to respect them, how to connect with them. That's very much a part of what can develop, or what we can rediscover in our practice: really reconnecting with the emotional life and honouring that. That's what I hear you saying<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > One wing of longterm practice is learning how to open to ourselves" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#One wing of longterm practice is learning how to open to ourselves" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^21-5
###### 21-6
And a whole other wing is this business about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. Sometimes, you're quite right that bringing in a reflection of "not me, not mine, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>," etc., does tend to kind of dissolve whatever emotion is there. Now, it's almost like holding both these wings at once. If all one ever did, or all one ever could do in one's practice is just dissolve <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>, and one didn't really have the skill and the capacity, or the willingness, or the fearlessness to be with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> and feel them, and be able to hold oneself in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>, and connect with one's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> - if all one had was <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, it would be like a bird with one wing trying to fly. It's not going to get anywhere. It's not going to get off the ground, or it will just go round in circles<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > A whole other wing is understanding emptiness - birds need two wings" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#A whole other wing is understanding emptiness - birds need two wings" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^21-6
###### 21-7
If all one had was a very beautiful ability to be open with one's emotional life, to connect with it, to respect it, to express it, to hold it, to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> one's emotional life, to be clear about what's going on in one's emotional life - if all one had was _that_, again, like a bird with just one wing. One is missing the whole other half of practice. I think you're talking about a long term of practice, to really learn to hold these two together and kind of, "Do I understand both? Have I got skill in both? Am I really open to my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>, but can I also kind of let go of that whole arena of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> and see beyond it in that way?" To have both - again, we're talking about quite a mature practice - is it possible? Absolutely. Some people feel, "Well, I have to do one before I do another." I'm not sure if that's possible. You may have periods in your life where you're encouraging one more than another, and that's fine, and right now might be a period where you're actually wanting to respect the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> more and be with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> more, and that's totally fine - in which case, maybe shelve the other stuff for another time<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > You may have periods in your life where youre encouraging one more than another" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#You may have periods in your life where you're encouraging one more than another" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^21-7
###### 22-1
Yogi: Is it about appropriateness, then? ^22-1
###### 22-2
Rob: It's about, again, what's appropriate and helpful right now for you. In a way, sometimes we need to have an overview and quite a large view of our whole life and practice, which can be difficult, you know. "Where has my life been? Have I been an avoider of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>? Have I been too wrapped up and entangled in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>?" And then seeing, "What do I know how to do? What do I need to develop?" So you're asking a very big question. Do you see that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Have I been an avoider of emotions Or too wrapped up and entangled in emotions What do I need to develop" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Have I been an avoider of emotions Or too wrapped up and entangled in emotions What do I need to develop" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^22-2
###### 22-3
Yogi: Yeah. What I'm trying to find out is, where is this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span>? ^22-3
###### 22-4
Rob: You have, again, a couple of options. One is to just know what you're doing at any time, and sometimes say, "I'm just going to really respect the emotion and go into it and feel it, not do anything with it, to accept, feel it, and open to it, and hold myself in that, connect with it." Sometimes you do that. At other times you can explore some of these ways I've talked about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span>. Sometimes you'll find that beautiful <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> deepen with that. But more difficult <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> tend to dissolve. Sometimes you'll find that. But you can have a choice, even on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, just as long as you know what you're doing when<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > 1 respect the emotion and feel it" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#1 respect the emotion and feel it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^22-4
###### 22-5
Or the second option - this is totally valid - is you can just shelve one of them for a while and just say, "I know I need to get to the other one, and I'll get to it sometime, but not on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>." So both of those would be the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span> - the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span> meaning aware that they're both important in one's life, and one needs to learn how to do both. Without both, the practice hasn't really opened into its maturity. Exactly how you go about that, you have two options there. Does that make sense? Yeah? Good, okay<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > 2 shelve the emotion for later" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#2 shelve the emotion for later" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^22-5

**Q11: ability to move between different <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a></span> as the mark of mature practice** ^22-6
###### 22-7
Yogi: It sort of feels like there's been quite a lot about whether things can coexist or whether they kind of happen one after the other. Are you saying that the kind of mark of a really mature practice would be that things _do_ coexist, and we can hold them both, like whatever truth they are, and before then it's kind of like sometimes you have to shelve one thing ... or what? ^22-7
###### 22-8
Rob: We're going to get onto this in the third week, but if we just talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, I'll just say something now. I hope it doesn't confuse. But when you contemplate <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> in certain ways, things disappear. So problematic <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> disappear; objects disappear from <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>. It's said that only a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>, only a fully <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightened</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> - not even an <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">arahant</a></span> - just a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> is able to contemplate <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> and actually keep the object around at the same time. What I meant by "mature practice" was more that we're able to move between different <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a></span> things. And a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of seeing</a></span> is just that - it's not ultimately true. It's just a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of seeing</a></span>. In some instances or some interactions or some inner environments or situations, it's most helpful to see in one way. Here we've had an argument, and you and I have had an argument about something, and there's a difficulty, and I come to you, and I say, "Hey, Elizabeth, it's all empty." You're probably going to punch me. [laughter] What certain situations need is very relative, conventional language. We need to talk about our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>; we need to express what we feel to each other; we need to respect that. I need to respect my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> and your <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> at that level. So in that moment, that's what's helpful, that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span>. But I'm saying a mature practice is able to move between picking that up, putting it down, picking up other <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a></span> - <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a></span>_, etc. - and putting them down, not getting stuck in one or the other. Does that make sense<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Maturity in practice comes from being able to move between different ways of seeing" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Maturity in practice comes from being able to move between different ways of seeing" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^22-8
###### 23-1
Yogi: That answered my question, Rob. ^23-1
###### 23-2
Rob: Okay, good, good. It's a tall order. Not to underestimate - I'm talking about quite a large span of time that one would develop this in. But it's definitely possible, it's absolutely possible, and it's there, again, as a potential and as a possibility for us as human beings and as practitioners. ^23-2

###### 23-4
Yogi: Rob, when you said that the bad things, when we really look closely at them, tend to disappear, and the good ones tend to increase, why is that? ^23-4
###### 23-5
Rob: Okay. [laughter] We're going to get into this in the third week. So we do a week on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, a week on <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and a week on what all this has to do with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> and all that. So usually, when there's something difficult around, an emotion that's difficult, or even a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> sensation that's difficult, or anything that's difficult, we tend to think, "Well, that thing exists, and then I can relate to it in any way that I choose to." Or maybe I can't choose, but I relate to it. So there's a thing, and then the relationship we have with it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > We think there is a thing and then the relationship we have with it" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We think there is a thing and then the relationship we have with it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^23-5

So the way that I'm looking, and my relationship, is something that _feeds_, is part of what creates and feeds and shapes and colours any object in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Present moment" class="internal-link">Present moment</a></span>. So an object doesn't exist independently of the way I'm looking at it, and the way I'm relating to it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > But the thing and our relationship are actually not separate" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#But the thing and our relationship are actually not separate" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^23-6

As we begin to learn to let go of that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, for instance, or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>, or identification, we begin to let go of certain factors, we're actually taking away some of what is building an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. And so, it begins to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span>. Difficult things are held in place, basically, by <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, by <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>, by identification, by all these things we're talking about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> of. So as you let go of them, they tend to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a></span>, at one level, or peace, or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, is also held in place by <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>, to an extent. But it's a more subtle kind of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span>. What one finds is that if one lets go of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a></span> towards <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> actually deepens. It becomes more refined. So it goes from, for instance, a very sort of bubbly <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> to a more peaceful <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>. It's dependent - because we're not holding it in place by the way we're looking and relating. Does that make sense, or have I confused ...? No? Okay. We're going to talk a lot about this in the third week<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > When we let go were actually taking away some of what is building an experience and it begins to fade" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#When we let go we're actually taking away some of what is building an experience and it begins to fade" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^23-8

Yogi: Does that mean they exist outside of ourselves? ^24-2
###### 24-3
Rob: Well, ultimately, no. That's what all this is pointing to: nothing exists in a way outside of one's self, outside of what one's bringing to that. So it's a different question than, "If a tree falls in the forest, and there's no one around, does it make a noise?" It's not going there, to that question. It's avoiding that question. We're talking about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> in the light of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> arising or not.

Rob: Okay. So this ... [laughs] Tea is late today, by the way, because of her. [laughter] No, no, this is great. This is great. There aren't many better questions than what you're asking and what's being asked. These are the real - they end up being the kind of deepest questions that a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> can ask about life. At the moment it might seem a bit cerebral and everything, but they're actually really important, deep questions. Eventually, all practice leads to these kind of questions, and really seeing them for ourselves, because the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, as I keep saying, leads to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. There's nothing about being clever here; it's just that the outcome of going into these questions is really <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">deep freedom</a></span> and very deep <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>.

Yogi: Which one? Naked <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>? ^24-7
###### 24-8
Rob: Well, same. Naked <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Attention" data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">bare attention</a></span>. Yeah, same, same. It can be really helpful as a concept: "My <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is all over the place. I'm aware that I'm projecting all kinds of things onto people and experiences, etc. I'm colouring things. I'm distorting things in all ways. Let me see if I can be <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a></span>, be very simple in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, and get underneath all those views and opinions, likes and dislikes, distortions and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>, and preconceptions. Underneath, I'll meet the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> with as naked an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> as possible." That's part of what we tend to call "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>," and the assumption is that there is such a thing and that one can get to a point where one is not colouring objects in any way, and then one has arrived at, "That's how the object really is. That's how it is. This is it. This is _things as they are_," which is also a phrase that's very popular in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, "things as they are," and actually a phrase that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> used. But that's not what he meant when he used it - "things as they are.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > With naked awareness our assumption is that we can get to things as they are" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#With naked awareness our assumption is that we can get to things as they are" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^24-8
###### 25-1
Rather, what he meant - "things as they are" - you cannot find a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, a state of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, a moment of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, that is not shaping or creating or colouring or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricating</a></span> an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. We tend to think, "Well, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> is this sort of midpoint where you've got rid of all this other stuff." Or we think, "Yeah, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> is that." But when you really go into it, there's no such thing. The very <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> itself is that it's always creating an object and shaping, colouring - '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricating</a></span>' is the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s word - <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricating</a></span> an object. As such, there is no place to stand where you see a thing as it is _independently of the way I'm looking at it_. What we're doing in this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, what we're leading up towards, is using <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> as a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of seeing</a></span> that. It doesn't sound obvious at first, but it will hopefully become clear. [laughter] It _will_ come clear.

###### 25-3
Yogi 3: So, Rob, does that mean the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> around an object, or just the - you know, I see a green and yellow thing, and I think I see primrose and ... So, do you mean both discrimination and ...? ^25-3
###### 25-4
Rob: The whole level of it, as you go deeper into it, the whole <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> begins to be unravelled, and the assumption that things exist independent of the way we're looking at them is seen to be a falsehood. It's just not true. To understand that, that's what it means to understand <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. That's exactly what it means, and that's what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> taught: liberating <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. That's exactly what he taught, what he meant. So when the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> uses the words "things as they are," what he means, what he meant, was "things as they are" - it's _dependent_, dependent co-arising. They don't exist independently. To see a thing as it is means to really recognize - and again, totally in one's heart, one really knows - that it doesn't exist independently. We struggle with things in life partly because we believe that they exist independently: "This knee <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> - that's _really_ what it is. It really hurts. It really hurts exactly this amount. It's not that bad, but it's quite bad." And we believe it exists independently, and then we struggle with things. At a very deep level, when we begin to undermine that belief in the independent existence of things, then our whole sense of reality is opened up. It's almost as if <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> can't land anywhere; we can't land anywhere to struggle with anything. Or we believe that less and less, put it that way. And then comes more and more a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> comes. It will become clearer in time what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hell" class="internal-link">hell</a></span> this has got to do with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. But there's a reason we put it at the third week. But it's coming up now, and it's fine. We're moving in that direction<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > The whole nature of perception begins to be unravelled" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#The whole nature of perception begins to be unravelled" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^25-4

So, _if_ there's someone who doesn't understand this right now ... [laughs] Just kidding. If you ... [laughter] If this isn't totally crystal clear right now, don't worry. Going back to - I think I started the talk on _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ saying, when we were conceiving of this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, I had a good think about it and thought, "What's a person going to get out of this?" You can't go wrong. So it may be that we get to the end of the three weeks, and all this stuff about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> is "I've got it."
