[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]

<br/>

###### 1-1
So we can [[Cultivation|cultivate]], develop, expand the heart's capacity for [[Metta|loving-kindness]]. That is possible for us, and in the process of doing that we need to be asking, well, what helps that process? What feeds that process? How does that expansion come about? How does the heart grow in [[Metta|loving-kindness]]? We need to be asking those questions and also asking, what blocks it? What starves it? What gets in the way[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#What helps what blocks loving-kindness|?]] ^1-1
###### 1-2
And so very broadly speaking, just the repetition of the phrases, on the cushion, in the [[Meditation|walking meditation]], just having [[Devotion|faith]] in that level of [[reconditioning]] the [[mind]], [[reconditioning]] the heart - hugely significant. And just over and over again, we are retraining the intentionality in the [[mind]] and the heart. And sometimes, when the _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ itself is there, that, too, is a way in which the heart's capacity increases[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Faith in reconditioning mind and heart by just repeting the phrases; samadhi|.]] ^1-2
###### 1-3
There are many ways this happens. Some are on the cushion in full [[meditation]] and some informal. So how we act, how we speak, what we choose, how we are in our interactions - that's feeding the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ as well. And we need to inquire into that - as important what happens outside of formal [[meditation]] as it is inside. And then, within formal [[meditation]], sometimes it feels like it's going well, okay? It feels good. There's the _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ there - great, lovely, and put a lot of emphasis on this, inclining towards that. So this is why we keep saying about the [[Embodiment|body]], the [[Embodiment|body]] sensitivity. And you drop a word in or a phrase, and it has some resonance in the [[Embodiment|body]] sensitivity, or the [[Embodiment|body]] feels peaceful, there's a feeling of peace around, there's a feeling of warmth, of [[happiness]] - actually connecting with that in the [[Embodiment|body]], feeling it, feeling just a sense of comfort in the [[Embodiment|body]], just a vague, unremarkable sense of [[Pleasantness|well-being]]. That connection with those kinds of [[feelings]] in the [[Embodiment|body]] helps the _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_. It allows the _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_, the [[Samadhi|unification]] to go deeper. And in so doing, the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ kind of gets into the cells, becomes, in a very deep way, part of the [[habit]], a [[habit]] for the being, a [[habit]] for the [[consciousness]] via the [[Embodiment|body]] and via the _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Body sensitivity allows samadhi to go deeper|.]] ^1-3
###### 1-4
And sometimes, it doesn't feel to be going well. It feels like there's no feeling, I'm even irritated or whatever, aversive, there's [[fear]] around, whatever it is - doesn't feel like it's going well. That's fine too. And what we said right at the beginning: just keep having [[Devotion|faith]] in this planting of the seeds with the phrases, just planting the seeds of intention. Not to jump too much into judging one's practice, by whether it feels like it's going well or whether it feels like it's going badly. There's too much going on, so to speak, underneath the radar, in the darkness of what is not conscious, and we have to kind of respect that and have some [[Devotion|faith]] in the process[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#If it doesn't feel to be going well just keep having faith|.]] ^1-4
###### 1-5
I can't remember if I said this already in here, but when a farmer or a gardener plants a seed, the germination of that seed, the [[Cultivation|nourishment]] of that seed goes on underneath the ground, in the darkness, invisible. And it's very similar with the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice. There's a lot going on at levels we don't actually have access to. To trust that. So there is certainly the fact of the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ deepening and expanding through the _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_, but also deepening and expanding through just this patient [[Devotion|faith]] in the planting of the seeds[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Simile gardener having faith that the seed grows underground|.]] ^1-5
###### 2-1
What I want to go into today is the relationship of [[insight]] and the deepening of [[love]] and the deepening of [[compassion]]. So on this [[retreat]], what we talk about - and we've already started, and it kind of gets more and more as it goes on - is the way that the practices of [[love]] and [[compassion]] actually bring [[insight]], as part of what they bring. They bring a liberating [[insight]]. They bring [[insight]] that frees. This is not the usually understood way of [[Insight|understanding]] [[love]] and [[compassion]], but it's there. And as we practise [[Metta|loving-kindness]] and [[compassion]], [[insight]] comes with that - _can_ come with that. It's a possibility[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#As we practice metta insight comes with that|.]] ^2-1
###### 2-2
What I want to talk about today is the other way round: how it might be that [[insight]] feeds [[Metta|loving-kindness]] and [[compassion]]. So I'm talking about the ways [[Metta|loving-kindness]] and [[compassion]] can be fed: in our lives, in our interactions, in the _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_, through the patient planting of the seeds, and now just this piece about [[insight]] leading to [[love]] and [[compassion]][[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#It works the other way around as well insight feeds loving-kindness and compassion|.]] ^2-2
###### 2-3
Sometimes we can be doing this practice, and we feel as if we are creating the _[[Metta|mettā]]_. You're sort of sitting and huffing and puffing and squeezing and ... [laughs] And if you're lucky, you know, a drop of _[[Metta|mettā]]_. It feels like it's something [[Fabrication|fabricated]], created, which it _is_, on one level. But sometimes we might ask ourselves a question: is [[love]] something created? Now, actually it _is_, but are _we_ creating it? What's actually going on there? Or is it maybe the case that [[love]] and [[compassion]] may be the natural state and a natural expression when the heart, when the [[consciousness]] is not entangled or obscured or clouded by [[clinging]] and by [[Avijja|delusion]]? It's much more as if one is _uncovering_ [[love]] and _uncovering_ [[compassion]]. So that's an interesting question: what's actually going on here? Are we creating it? Or are we _uncovering_ it? Are we _allowing_ it[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Are we creating metta or are we uncovering it|?]] ^2-3
###### 2-4
When we talk about [[insight]] and [[Meditation|insight meditation]], it's a very good question to ask: what does that mean? What is [[insight]]? What is [[Meditation|insight meditation]]? [[Insight]] is an [[Insight|understanding]] - so either intellectual or intuitive, any kind of [[Insight|understanding]] - that releases [[clinging]], and in so doing, releases [[Dukkha|suffering]]. So that the mark of [[insight]] is this release of [[Dukkha|suffering]]. That's how you know that what's going on is an [[insight]]. [[Dukkha|Suffering]] either goes completely or just lessens to some degree because of some [[Ways of looking|way of seeing]] or some way of [[Insight|understanding]]. [[Insight]] releases [[clinging]], and in releasing the [[clinging]], the struggling, the [[Aversion|pushing away]], the pulling, the holding on, the identifying - any form of [[clinging]] - [[insight]] releases the [[clinging]]. And because it releases the [[clinging]], [[Dukkha|suffering]] is released[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Insight is any kind of understanding that releases clinging and thus suffering|.]] ^2-4
###### 2-5
When the [[Buddha]] talked about [[Meditation|insight meditation]], there's a number of ways of interpreting it. One way would be that it's just kind of sitting around, or watching what's going on, and trying not to _do_ much. [laughs] And hopefully out of that, _budoom_, up comes an [[insight]], which is perfectly valid, to an extent. [laughter] But sometimes we might find, you're watching your [[breath]], or just, you know ... [huffing and puffing] "In, out, in, out, arising, falling, arising, falling," and _hoping_ that out of that, [[insight]] cracks into the being. Or just trying to sit there doing nothing, and again the hope, the assumption is that in that 'doing nothing,' an [[insight]] will be born. There is definitely something to that, and in a way - I'm not putting it in very attractive terms, but it's actually a very beautiful approach to practice[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Insight from not doing much or doing nothing at all|.]] ^2-5
###### 2-6
Oftentimes, though, the [[Buddha]] talks about another approach, which is more, "Can we practise [[Ways of looking|ways of seeing]] and ways of relating?" So what he means when he talks about [[Meditation|insight meditation]] or [[insight]] is _practising_ certain [[ways of looking]] at [[experience]] in the moment, _practising_ [[ways of looking]] that bring release, that let go of the [[clinging]]. So we typically look in ways that actually lead to [[clinging]], lead to [[Dukkha|suffering]]. That's what we do all the time. The [[Buddha]] said, "Can you learn to look in different ways that bring release?" Release of the [[clinging]] brings release from [[Dukkha|suffering]], and that brings [[love]]. That brings [[love]][[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Alternative practice ways of looking that bring release|.]] ^2-6
###### 3-1
So [[insight]], practising ways of [seeing] - I'll go into what I mean. I'm talking a little bit abstractly. I realize that it might sound a little abstract right now. I'll explain what I mean as I go through today. Practising [[Ways of looking|ways of seeing]] and relating that bring [[freedom]], release, and [[love]]. And what I want to go into today is, is it possible (and these are just possibilities) that we can incorporate some of those [[ways of looking]], some of those practices, into the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice itself, so that we've kind of got a refining of the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice that's possible, and the [[compassion]] practice that's possible? I'll explain what I mean[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#This talk is about incorporating some of those ways of looking into metta practice|.]] ^3-1
###### 3-2
In a way, I sort of want to start by going off on a bit of a tangent. But it always seems relevant on this [[retreat]], so I'm going to do it again. And that has to do with - to speak a little bit about [[fear]]. So [[fear]] actually is an example of a kind of [[clinging]] or a kind of [[aversion]]. [[Fear]] is actually a species of [[aversion]] that blocks [[love]]. [[Fear]] blocks [[love]]. And to investigate this in our lives. Is that the case, that when we're afraid there's a kind of closing of the [[love]]? And we might notice - if you pay [[attention]], you might notice that [[love]] and [[fear]] have this kind of inverse relationship. Originally, the [[Buddha]] offered the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice to a group of monks who were really, really afraid in the forest. That was his initial offering as an antidote and as a response to [[fear]].^[According to the commentary to the _Sutta Nipāta_, the Buddha taught the _Mettā Sutta_ (Sn 1:8) as a protective discourse to a group of monks who were experiencing frightening visions and sounds produced by hostile deities. See Bhikkhu Bodhi, tr., _The Suttanipāta: An Ancient Collection of the Buddha's Discourses Together with Its Commentaries_ (Boston: Wisdom, 2017), 566-7] But we might notice in our lives that when [[fear]] is strong, [[love]] is weak. And when [[love]] is strong, [[fear]] is weak. They have this inverse relationship. And conversely, we might also notice, in ourselves and in the world, when [[fear]] is strong, violence - either a psychological or a physical violence - is strong. It goes with [[fear]]. You can see this very easily in animals, in beings, in ourselves, in political groups, in ideological groups[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Fear is an aversion that blocks love|.]] ^3-2
###### 3-3
So I want to say a little bit about working with [[fear]], because often it _does_ come up in the context of a [[retreat]] like this anyway for people. And working with [[fear]] would usually come under the umbrella of [[Meditation|insight meditation]], learning to work with that. I mentioned in one of the talks (I think it was the talk on _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_): sometimes in a practice like this - we're sitting, walking - _something_ feels like it's deepening and opening. And maybe just isolated moments, or little stretches of time or whatever, the being, the [[consciousness]], finds itself in territory that's unfamiliar: much more open, [[Perception|perceptions]] have changed a little bit, the [[Embodiment|body]] feels different, the sense of [[Nondualism|separation]] feels different, the [[The Self|sense of self]] feels different, maybe dramatically so, maybe just a little bit. And this can bring up [[fear]][[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Samadhi can bring up fear|.]] ^3-3
###### 3-4
And very, very skilful to learn, if the [[fear]] is not too strong, then actually one has a choice in that moment. With that opening, the opening of the being, the opening of [[consciousness]], there will be some [[pleasantness]] with that, alongside the [[fear]]. And this [[fear]] and the [[pleasantness]] coexist. What usually happens is we get sucked into the [[fear]], and like a magnet, we go into the [[fear]]. We get pulled into it and spun around by it, with it. Sometimes it's possible just to sit back a little bit and have a look: I've got this pleasant [[Pleasantness|enjoyment]] in the [[Embodiment|body]], there's openness, there's warmth, etc. There's a [[letting go]], and there's [[fear]]. And learn - and this is a skill, it's a practice - learn to incline the [[awareness]] towards what's enjoyable in there. So in that openness, there _will_ be something that's enjoyable. It's an acquired taste to learn how to dip in a little bit, dip in. You can be in control of this. You can dip into what's enjoyable and not give so much [[attention]] to the [[fear]]. You don't have to ignore it, but you also don't have to feed it by getting obsessed with it and worried about it and drawn into it. So this is a practice, but it's actually very important, when the [[fear]] is not that strong[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#When the fear is not that strong you can dip into what's enjoyable and not give so much attention to the fear|.]] ^3-4
###### 4-1
But sometimes, of course, [[fear]] does feel stronger. Or it feels like we're unable to do that. And sometimes we get very strong [[fear]], maybe in the context of a [[retreat]] and, of course, outside a [[retreat]]. When we look at [[fear]], we have to ask, what actually is [[fear]]? What is the [[experience]] of [[fear]]? It's an interesting one - or [[anxiety]]. And when we look, what do we see in the [[experience]]? So oftentimes we don't hang out with it long enough to actually unpack it and see what's there. What we notice with [[fear]] is usually unpleasant [[Embodiment|body sensations]] - in the extreme, the heart is pounding, the tummy is in knots or butterflies. Unpleasant [[Embodiment|body]] sensation, and [[aversion]] to the physical sensations. We don't like them. We want to get rid of them. That's there alongside the unpleasant sensations. So [[Embodiment|body sensations]] and [[aversion]][[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#When the fear is stronger ask what actually is fear Body sensations|.]] ^4-1
###### 4-2
Thoughts. Often thoughts, and often future thoughts, associated with [[fear]], and unpleasant thoughts about what's going to happen or what might happen. Thoughts associated with [[fear]], as part of the constellation of [[fear]], and again, their unpleasantness, the [[aversion]] to them, [[aversion]] to that. So there are the [[Embodiment|body sensations]] and the thoughts, and in each case there's [[aversion]][[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Thoughts also have aversion associated with them|.]] ^4-2
###### 4-3
Third factor, a little more subtle, with [[fear]] is the kind of climate of the [[mind]], the inner texture of the way the [[mind]] feels. And when there's [[fear]] around, it shrinks. The [[mind]] shrinks. It gets small. You notice this with [[fear]]? The actual [[consciousness]] feels like it's constricting. That, generally speaking, is unpleasant. Human beings don't like a constricted [[consciousness]]. And so, again, it being unpleasant, there's going to be [[aversion]] to it: I want to get rid of it. I want it to go away. So there's the [[Embodiment|body]], the thoughts, and the texture, the climate of the [[mind]], and correspondingly, the [[aversion]] to that[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Inner texture of the mind shrinks when there's fear around|.]] ^4-3
###### 4-4
These aversions are very important to investigate, because when we ask, "What's my relationship with [[fear]]?" - and this is a fundamental [[Dharma]] question, "What's my relationship with _anything_?" - usually the relationship with [[fear]] is, we're afraid of it. We're actually afraid of [[fear]]. We have [[fear]] of [[fear]]. This is part of what makes [[fear]] _[[fear]]_. It's that we're actually afraid of the [[fear]] itself. As our [[Meditation|meditation practice]], in general, develops over time, we learn to - we _can_ learn to accommodate that [[experience]] of [[fear]]: the [[Embodiment|body]] [[experience]], the thinking [[experience]], and the texture of the [[mind]] [[experience]]. We learn to just bring [[mindfulness]] to it and just to be with it. And what we get, slowly, over time, is a sense of confidence that it's just some unpleasant sensations, just some unpleasant thoughts: "I can be with this. [[Awareness]] can hold it." What's almost always lacking with [[fear]] is confidence. We don't feel confident that we can actually be with the [[fear]] and accommodate it, and be okay with it. With practice, bringing [[mindfulness]] to all of it, we just see: it's just that, and it's accommodatable. Confidence comes. It's hugely significant[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We are afraid of fear but we can be with this which brings confidence|.]] ^4-4
###### 4-5
So usually our relationship with [[fear]] is one of [[aversion]] or fleeing. We want to get away from, run away from the unpleasantness of it. But that very [[aversion]] and fleeing makes the [[experience]] of the [[fear]] increase. This [[fear]] of the [[fear]], this [[aversion]] to the [[fear]], is part of the whole constellation. It's part of the whole mechanism and wheel of [[fear]]. It makes it more difficult. When there are unpleasant [[fear]] sensations in the [[Embodiment|body]] and we flee them out of [[aversion]], out of [[fear]] of them, where do we go? Where do we flee to? Straight up into the head! The [[energy]] goes away from the groundedness in the [[Embodiment|body]] and straight up into the head. There's more [[energy]] in the thinking. There are already unhelpful, unskilful, unpleasant thoughts in the thinking, looping around. You've just injected a whole lot of extra [[energy]] in there because one is fleeing. And it increases, actually feeding the whole fire of the [[fear]][[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Fear of fear feeds the fire of the fear|.]] ^4-5
###### 5-1
So the reaction that we have to [[fear]] is not something separate from the [[fear]] itself. They're not two separate things. The reaction is part of the [[anxiety]] itself. So you can check this out. They're not two separate things. If we can soften that reaction or take away that reaction somewhat, what we'll notice is that [[fear]] cannot support itself. It cannot support itself. So not to take this on authority just because I say it or someone else says it. See if one can experiment with this when [[fear]] is around. [[Fear]] needs me to be aversive and reactive to it. The reaction is part of the mechanism. What happens when I soften that reaction? [[Fear]] cannot support itself without me fearing it, without me reacting to it[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Fear needs me to be aversive and reactive to it|.]] ^5-1
###### 5-2
Sometimes our relationship with [[fear]] is putting pressure - part of the [[aversion]] - pressure on it to be different. It's all the same: it's fuel for the fire of [[fear]]. So to be aware of these mechanisms, to see, "Can they be relaxed? Can I soften them?" Or judging myself - if I judge myself that [[fear]] is around, again, it's fuel for the fire. What am I assuming about myself because there's [[fear]] around? What am I assuming about my practice? That I'm a failure, that it's rubbish, that I'm not getting anywhere - just because [[fear]] is around? That's also something that we're injecting into the moment that's building the [[fear]][[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Self-judgement is also fuel for the fire of fear|.]] ^5-2
###### 5-3
So [[fear]] is human. Can we see the humanity of it? Can we bring [[Metta|kindness]], again, to meet that humanity, to meet the [[fear]]? So when we say, "May _I_ be safe and protected. May _I_ be ..." whatever the other phrases are ... [laughter] When we say that, who is the 'I' in that moment? There's [[fear]] around. Who is the 'I'? The 'I' is me with [[fear]]. It's not me without the [[fear]], me when the [[fear]] goes away, me and idealized [[fear]]. You could say, in that moment, you are you with [[fear]], I am I with [[fear]]. It's included. We have a tendency - it's all part of the [[aversion]] and the almost normal reaction to [[fear]], to want to get it away, and to even exclude that part from the _[[Metta|mettā]]_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Fear is human|.]] ^5-3
###### 5-4
A lot of [[fear]] in our lives, in a very general sense, has to do with the future - "What will happen to me? Will I be okay? Will it be all right? Will it turn out okay? What might go wrong?" - on all kinds of levels. You know, basic [[Embodiment|body]] level, survival level, but all kinds of other levels, emotionally, in terms of security, in terms of [[relationships]], in terms of possessions, anything, future thoughts: "Will it be okay for me?[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Fear of the future|"]] ^5-4
###### 5-5
One really, really fundamental [[Dharma]] question comes up then. [[Fear]] about the future and "Will I be okay? How will the future be _for me_?" Fundamental [[Dharma]] question: do I really know how to really, really, _really_ take care of the future? What does it mean to _really_ take care of the future? And so, Dharmically, what is it that leads to a sense of security, [[happiness]], [[Pleasantness|well-being]], peace in our life? What is it[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Do I know how to really really take care of the future|?]] ^5-5
###### 5-6
The [[Buddha]], over and over again, points to cultivating qualities of heart, qualities of [[mind]], qualities of being - like _[[Metta|mettā]]_, like [[compassion]], etc., [[generosity]], [[equanimity]], [[mindfulness]], a whole host of inner qualities that become our kind of (what's that word?) 'investment portfolio.' [laughter] If you know that term from whatever, stocks and all that stuff. Very actually rare maturity in practice, very rare maturity. Often we can just say, "Yeah, yeah, I know, that's what I need to be happy. I know that I really need to build these qualities. I know that's where [[happiness]] comes from." Very rare level of maturity in practice to come across someone who's actually living that out, and putting the investment in that, and not worrying _so_ much about the other stuff. And of _course_, we need to take care of material things, etc. But it's actually quite a mature practice that has come to the point when it's just convinced in the heart, in the being: "I know where to put my eggs. I know what it is that leads to [[happiness]] and peace. I know how to take care of the future." And you think how much [[fear]], as well, in this respect has to do with, "What will they think of me? What will people I'm meeting - what are they going to think? Are they going to think I'm stupid, or ugly, or boring, or whatever it is?" How much of our [[fear]] is social [[fear]], is around that[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Cultivating beautiful qualities of the heart and mind as an "investment portfolio"|?]] ^5-6
###### 6-1
When we [[Cultivation|cultivate]] beautiful qualities of the heart, beautiful qualities of the [[mind]], they bring with them [[happiness]]. And there is enough [[happiness]], and then what people think of me becomes _almost_ insignificant. This is very real, and as I said, it's quite a rare maturity that actually lives that out in one's life, through one's practice. We take care of the future. [[Fear]] is [[fear]] of the future. How do we take care of the future? Through [[cultivation]]. Through the kind of [[cultivation]] that we're doing here, and a whole host of other qualities[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We take care of the future by cultivating beautiful qualities|.]] ^6-1
###### 6-2
And also in the relationship to the present. Is the relationship to the present one of openness, of [[Metta|kindness]], of curiosity, of interest, of [[mindfulness]]? When the relationship to the present has those qualities in it, the future takes care of itself, just moment by moment. Those two pieces - cultivating what's beautiful, and taking care of the relationship with the present - the future is taken care of in the deepest way. And in a very real way, we come to worry less about, "Will there be enough money later on? Will there be security? Will I be okay in terms of a house? What will happen in terms of, will I find a partner? Will my partner die? Will they stay with me? Will I be alone?" All that stuff, not that it's not important stuff in our lives, but its hold on us, and the [[fear]] that oftentimes is around - we don't even realize it's around, running our lives, running our choices. How much of that stuff is actually dictating our choices in our life? And we don't even register it as a kind of [[fear]]. And that stuff just begins to get less because of the power of cultivating what's beautiful, over time. And this is something very real. It's not theoretical, and it's not unrealistic. It's something very, very real that can come into the being, into one's life in a very real, very practical way[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Taking care of the relationship with the present|.]] ^6-2
###### 6-3
Right, that was my tangent. [laughter] But I do feel it's important, and it's actually an aspect of [[clinging]], and what we're talking about - releasing [[clinging]]. [[Fear]] is a kind of [[clinging]]/[[aversion]] that you can release through practice[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Fear is a kind of clinging that you can release through practice|.]] ^6-3
###### 6-4
What I want to explore in the remaining part of the talk is this way that [[insight]] practices can potentially be used as a kind of background within the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice. I want to offer some possibilities. Really just hear them as that: _optional_ possibilities. So for some people, this will be very interesting, very applicable, and fascinating. For other people, it will just be, "Okay, doesn't really attract me. It doesn't seem to have much to do with me." It's fine, but I want to put them out there[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Optional insight practices as a background within the metta practice|.]] ^6-4
###### 6-5
So these are just some of the possibilities, and I think I want to go through - I think there are seven here [**(_i_)-(_vii_)** below]. I mentioned the other day, in the talk the other night, as we do the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice, in a very non-linear way, there can be a deepening. And there can be a sense, at times, of merging, and the heart merging with the heart of another, or a sense of [[oneness]] opening up - _can_ be, at times, for some people. When we talk about _[[Anatta|anattā]]_ - and John talked the other day about _[[Anatta|anattā]]_, and I touched on it - when we talk about that, it's actually not the same as [[oneness]]. It's something a little bit different. But that [[oneness]] is still really important when it comes[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#There can be a sense of oneness opening up|.]] ^6-5
###### 6-6
So what I want to put this in the framework of is what's called the [[three characteristics]]. Some of you may be familiar with this and some less so. The [[three characteristics]] of [[experience]], the [[three characteristics]] of [[Phenomenon|phenomena]], which the [[Buddha]] talked about, and they are: ^6-6
###### 7-1
**(1) _[[Impermanence|Anicca]]_**, which means '[[impermanence]],' changing [[nature]] of everything that arises, disappears. All things are changing, [[Impermanence|impermanent]], _[[Impermanence|anicca]] -_ [[impermanence]][[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Anicca|.]] ^7-1
###### 7-2
**(2) _[[Dukkha]]_**, which means 'unsatisfactory.' So all things, again, are not capable of bringing lasting satisfaction. They're not ultimately satisfying. They're unsatisfactory[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Dukkha|.]] ^7-2
###### 7-3
**(3)** And the last one is **_[[Anatta|anattā]]_**, which means they're '[[Anatta|not-self]].' They don't belong to me. They're not mine. They are not me[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Anatta|.]] ^7-3
###### 7-4
Now, when we first hear those, we can think, "Well, that sounds pretty bleak. Things are [[Impermanence|impermanent]], unsatisfactory, and there's no me or whatever," and it's just like, "Oh, these Buddhists!" [laughter] They're not supposed to be bleak. Unfortunately, there's a whole current in the teaching that's gone on for about 2,000 years [laughter] and it's still very alive and healthy today, that actually says: "This _is_ bleak, and the more bleak and miserable you get from reflecting on it, the better." [laughter] "If you think about [[impermanence]], and [[Dukkha|unsatisfactoriness]], and this '[[Anatta|not-self]]' business, and you really feel, 'This is terrible. This is really bad news,' then you're really on the right track in your practice![[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Some strands of tradition see this as intentionally bleak|"]] ^7-4
###### 7-5
I pretty much completely disagree, and I don't think that's the way the [[Buddha]] intended it or meant it. They are [[ways of looking]], skills in looking, that in looking bring - _should_ bring, if one's going about it the right way, _should_ bring a sense of [[freedom]] and [[love]]. They're practices, [[ways of looking]], lenses for looking at [[experience]] in the moment that _should_ bring with them [[freedom]] and [[love]]. And if they're not, if they don't, it means one needs to play with it, tinker with it, until one learns to contemplate that way, contemplate one of the [[three characteristics]], or all of them, in ways that actually bring [[freedom]] and [[love]]. So it is unfortunate there is this - well, quite a number of strands in the traditions that really feel that one should have a kind of existential angst, or trembling, or [[fear]], or misery, or [[depression]], or kind of _blah_, or whatever. [laughter[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#I disagree - the three characteristics are ways of looking that should bring freedom and love|]]] ^7-5

**Rob**: Is it a cultural thing? No, it's not. Thank you for saying that. It's not just a cultural thing. It goes back to early [[commentaries]], in fact, early [[commentaries]] from about five hundred years after the time of the [[Buddha]]'s [[death]], and probably they were around even quite soon after the [[Buddha]] died, and it took root there. It may be exacerbated by cultural aspects, yeah, certainly, but it's not just cultural[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#It's not just a cultural thing but comes from the commentaries|.]] ^7-10
###### 7-11
Anyway, so these [[three characteristics]], what I want to go into, this is just a framework for what I'm talking about, these possibilities which may or may not be interesting to you. And if they're not, that's really fine. And one can keep doing the basic practices - absolutely fine. But also want to put out there a sense of how deep these practices of [[love]] and [[compassion]] can actually go. They're almost - not infinite, but an incredible depth of refinement and subtlety that can come into this practice. And one can just deepen them and bring [[insight]] and [[Insight|understanding]] into that in ways that are very beautiful. It will be attractive to some people. It will seem to fit in with one's previous practice for some people, and less so for others. But I just want to lay it out as a sense of possibility for people[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#One can bring insight into the metta practice in ways that are very beautiful|.]] ^7-11
###### 8-1
[[Impermanence|Anicca]], [[impermanence]]] **(1)** So the first one is this **_[[Impermanence|anicca]]_, [[impermanence]]**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#1 Anicca impermanence|.]] ^8-1
###### 8-2
**(_i_)** At one level, what the [[Buddha]] meant, what he talked about, is **remembering [[death]] - remembering [[death]] and the unpredictability of life**. So we can be doing the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice, and one's directing, attempting to direct the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ towards another being and just holding, in the background of [[awareness]], just a light reflection on the fact of their mortality: "They will die. Like all of us, they will die." Now, remember, as I just said, it shouldn't be bleak. It shouldn't be depressing, so only to use this if it feels like it's actually unlocking some [[love]] and [[compassion]] in the heart. If one introduces it and it just feels like, "Ugh, gosh," a terrible [[fear]], or morbidity or a paralysis comes in, leave it. But you may find that just giving the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ to the benefactor, giving the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ to the neutral person, whoever it is, difficult person, and one just reflects, "They are subject to [[death]]. They are subject to [[death]]." Very likely, they don't know _when_ they're going to die. Not just [[death]], but they're also subject to the whole range of what this word _[[Impermanence|anicca]]_ means: uncertainty, change. And our life involves an incredible amount of uncertainty and change. That's the [[nature]], that's the fabric of our existence. And they, like us, are subject to that. So just holding this lightly, this sense of _[[Impermanence|anicca]]_ that they are vulnerable to, holding that in the [[awareness]] very lightly, as one's doing the _[[Metta|mettā]]_, can either kick-start the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ when it feels like it's a little bit blocked or it can't really get off the ground, or deepen it at times when it already feels like it's going[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#a Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life|.]] ^8-2
###### 8-3
**(_ii_)** There are a few more with this, just within this realm of [[impermanence]]. Another one in relation to [[death]], and it's actually more subtle and perhaps more difficult for people. I'm not sure. Practising - again, all this is practice - **practising learning to see _this moment_ in the context of our [[death]]**. So I'll explain what I mean. Science, [[cosmology]], tells us that the universe is 13.7 billion years old - pretty old - and that it will last as least as long. Actually, its future is a little bit uncertain, but ... [laughter] It's either going to collapse back again after about the same amount of time, or keep going, don't know - long, long stretches of time. Our life within that is what? Fifty, seventy, ninety, a hundred years, if one's lucky. And there's a sense - you can practise with, you can play with this sometimes - having a sense of one's life and the lives of others being a very small, a _tiny_ span in the vastness of time, and a vastness of space. And if possible, you can even bring that into the moment[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#b Having a sense of one's life as a tiny span in the vastness of time and space|.]] ^8-3
###### 8-4
So right now, right now, in this moment, there is a moment of [[experience]] going on. [snaps fingers] What's happening? There's visual form, there's colour, there's sound, there's sight, there's a moment of [[perception]] - and it's almost like putting that in the context of this incredible vastness of time. We don't know what came before our life. We don't know what comes after, no matter what all the theories, including the Buddhist theories, say. There's _this moment_ in the context of a massive, almost unfathomably unthinkable unknown. And you can toy with this playing of [[perception]]. Something comes: this moment, [[death]], and vastness. And again, instead of unlocking [[fear]], sometimes it can unlock more [[love]]. So, things you can play with[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Put the moment of perception into context of the unknown|.]] ^8-4
###### 8-5
**(_iii_)** What's most common when we talk about - or in the tradition, when people talk about [[impermanence]] and the contemplation of [[impermanence]], is **trying to look, in the moment, at quite a rapid, moment-to-moment [[impermanence]] of [[Phenomenon|phenomena]]**. So every moment, there's something new. Every moment, a thought arises, a moment, a sound, a this, a that. And then when we pay [[attention]] to our [[experience]], we see [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] arising, passing quite rapidly. Now, one approach within that - and remember, we're putting these [[insight]] [[ways of looking]] in the context of our _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice - sometimes you're doing the _[[Metta|mettā]]_, and you can just open the [[awareness]] up a little bit more to this [[impermanence]]. These are just possibilities[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#c moment-to-moment impermanence|.]] ^8-5
###### 9-1
And one notices, all I see in the moment is change. There's just a moment of this [snaps fingers], a moment of that [snaps fingers], a moment - I can't find anything in there that's 'me.' So this is the way [[impermanence]] feeds into an [[Insight|understanding]] of _[[Anatta|anattā]]_ and [[Anatta|not-self]]. The [[The Self|sense of self]] that one has, almost normally, the natural [[The Self|sense of self]] is that it's lasting and solid and fixed: "I am the same self I was twenty years ago, and thirty years ago, and I will be, if I'm still alive, in ten, twenty years." We have a sense of a fixed, independent, solid, lasting self. But when I look closely at my [[experience]], what I notice is change, change, change. There's nothing I can find that I can point to and say, "Well, _that's_ what my lasting, fixed self is." All I see is change, and the question is, "_Where_ am I? Who am I?" And when I look at the [[impermanence]] of the [[present moment]], there's a way that the [[The Self|sense of self]] can become much more permeable, less solid. All I'm noticing is just moments of change. I can't find this solid self. And there's the possibility, in the context of _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice, to open up that way[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#All I see in the moment is change not a lasting fixed self|.]] ^9-1
###### 9-2
And what _can_ happen, again, instead of [[fear]] and [[anxiety]] and all that, is it deepens the [[love]]. It can deepen or kick-start the [[love]] - this sense of, "Actually, I can't find anything here that's permanent." Now, you could also contemplate another person, and contemplate, "There's nothing to find _there_ that's permanent." And this is where it starts to get a little strange, because we tend to think of [[love]] being between self and other. And as we go into the [[nature]] of [[the self]], we find less and less of one. We find less and less solidity. And in that very moment of finding less solidity, instead of the whole [[love]] crumbling because we feel, "Well, who's giving [[love]] to whom?" [laughter] If I don't find anything here - I don't find any object to give it to - the opposite can happen. And almost paradoxically, there's a deepening of the [[love]]. Less self, less _other_ self to give the [[love]] to, and somehow, there's a deepening of the quality of the [[love]] - _can_ be. Remember, all this is just actually very rapidly painting a whole range of possibilities. That was three, with the [[impermanence]][[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Less self less other self to give the love to can deepen the love|.]] ^9-2
###### 9-3
**(_iv_)** There's another one, and this is really quite subtle, this one. So I'm not going in any particular order of difficult or subtle or whatever, but ... point to it. It kind of follows on from the one I just said. If I look at my [[experience]] in [[Meditation|insight meditation]], or even broadening my [[awareness]] in the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice - I'm doing the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice, but I just open it up a little bit - and again, what do I see? Change, change, change, change, change. Can't find anything that's not changing. What do I find, though, when I look, and I look for myself? All I see, all I can find, are [[Perception|perceptions]][[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#d In all the change all what I can find are perceptions|.]] ^9-3
###### 9-4
That's all I can find: [[perception]] of carpet, [[perception]] of microphone, [[perception]] of Julie, [[perception]] of person, [[perception]] of sound, [[perception]] of [[Embodiment|body]], [[perception]] of emotion - all I find in my [[experience]] is a series of [[Perception|perceptions]]. When I look inside, that's all I can find. Can't find anything that's not a [[perception]]. It's not possible. Can't find anything that's not a [[perception]]. A [[perception]] needs the world. So, to perceive the carpet, I need for that to be there. **All I find when I look for myself are [[Perception|perceptions]], and those [[Perception|perceptions]] are not separate from the universe, from the world**. We tend to think of [[the self]] as something separate and independent. When I look for it, all I find are [[Perception|perceptions]], which are actually inseparable from the rest of the universe. They are inseparable. This is quite a subtle point. It's not an easy point either to understand or to work with in [[meditation]], but I want to mention it. I find nothing but [[Perception|perceptions]], and they are inseparable, and in a way, it's seeing - it's a way that this [[impermanence]] can lead to an [[Insight|understanding]] of [[emptiness]]. Can't find a separate self. And again, can't find a giver of the [[love]] or a receiver of the [[love]] and yet, in that, it deepens the [[love]][[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Those perceptions are not separate from the universe from the world|.]] ^9-4
###### 10-1
So that was, I think, four possibilities in the realm of [[impermanence]]. I'm just putting like a buffet out there that you can choose from if you want. [laughter] And I'm very aware, some of this will attract your [[attention]]; it _may_ not be right on this [[retreat]] to explore it. But some of you will be attracted and say, "Some other time, I'd like to explore some of this." And just to know what's available, what is a possibility. So there's [[impermanence]][[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Four possibilities in the realm of impermanence|.]] ^10-1
###### 10-2
**(2)** [[Dukkha|Second characteristic]]: **_[[dukkha]]_, this [[Dukkha|unsatisfactoriness]], or '[[Dukkha|suffering]]'** is another way[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#2 dukkha unsatisfactoriness suffering|.]] ^10-2
###### 10-3
**(_v_)** So now this one is back to a relatively simple way of going about things. Just to realize: [[Dukkha|suffering]] is part of life. Okay? [[Dukkha|Suffering]] comes into everyone's life, in all kinds of ways and all kinds of levels. This is just a fact of our existence. [[Four Noble Truths|First Noble Truth]], [[Buddha]] said: "There is [[Dukkha|suffering]], _[[dukkha]]_." There is [[Dukkha|suffering]], and a whole range of it and a whole breadth of it. And sometimes we're doing the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ - and later on, all this applies to [[compassion]] practice as well, and we'll move on to [[compassion]] next week - **one is doing the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice, and just to drop in, directing it to someone else, just to drop in, "We are all in the same boat. We are all in the same boat with [[Dukkha|suffering]]."** So, this [[Embodiment|body]] experiences [[Dukkha|suffering]]. That [[Embodiment|body]], this [[Embodiment|body]], experiences [[Dukkha|suffering]], experiences [[pain]], experiences discomfort, experiences illness at times, will [[experience]] [[death]]. Some of these blend into each other. But just to reflect - you can just drop this in or have it as a light background to help the _[[Metta|mettā]]_, or kick-start the _[[Metta|mettā]]_: "We're all in the same boat. We all share these encounters with [[Dukkha|suffering]] in our life. We all meet [[Dukkha|suffering]] in all kinds of ways - through the difficulties we have in relationship, and circumstance, and life, and [[experience]], internally in the [[Embodiment|body]] and the [[mind]]." To bring that in as ways of feeding, deepening, injecting some life sometimes into the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice. So we're all in the same boat. (It's not a great phrase, but you know what I mean.[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#e Just to realize suffering is part of life - we are all in the same boat|)]] ^10-3
###### 10-4
**(_vi_)** Second one, still in the realm of this characteristic of _[[dukkha]]_: If, at some point, either on this [[retreat]] or another [[retreat]], if you **just lightly put your [[attention]] in the chest area - in the heart [[centre]], the heart chakra, whatever you want to call it - you just lightly keep the [[attention]] there, and you notice how it opens and closes.** The actual sense, energetically, or even subtly physically, of the heart, heart [[centre]], opens and closes. And it _will_ open and close many times in a day, countless times in our life. Opens and closes. **If you just have a light [[attention]] and interest there to when it's open and when it's closed, the heart [[centre]], what you notice is: when there's [[clinging]], guess what? [laughs] Closed, no entry! When we release [[clinging]], the heart [[centre]] opens.** Now, you can actually feel this. This is, again, why I keep going on about the sensitivity to the [[Embodiment|body]]. You can actually feel this: the heart [[centre]] opening and closing. It may not be that dramatic, so we may not be talking about colossal differences of opening and closing, but just little movements, and notice the relationship with [[clinging]]. Why did the [[Buddha]] go on and on and on and on about [[clinging]]? [[Clinging]] brings [[Dukkha|suffering]]. [[Clinging]] closes the heart. Releasing [[clinging]] brings [[freedom]]; it also brings [[love]]. And we can notice this so we're crystal clear about it, and there's just no arguing about it. It's very, very clear to us. We feel it in the heart and in the [[Embodiment|body]][[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#f feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre|.]] ^10-4
###### 11-1
Now, the good news is, part of the good news is that we can learn to become sensitive to this movement, to notice when there's [[clinging]]. By '[[clinging]],' I mean [[Aversion|pushing away]] what we don't like, over-identifying with things, trying to hold on to things, to grasp at things - all that is [[clinging]]. And we can begin to feel that and see this relationship, as I said, with the heart. And that when we release the [[clinging]], the heart opens and [[love]] comes. And we can develop over time - it's a gradual process - but we can develop our capacity to become sensitive to when there's [[clinging]] around[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We can develop our capacity to become sensitive to when there's clinging around|.]] ^11-1
###### 11-2
So sometimes [[clinging]] is extremely obvious. You know, we're literally hanging on to someone's leg: "Don't go! Don't leave me! Don't _leave_ me!" [laughter] This is very obvious. Or, you know, "If you go, I'm going to jump out of the window" or whatever. [laughter] It's obvious that [[clinging]] is there. But [[clinging]] has an enormous range to it. Again, like all these [[Dharma]] questions, it gets extremely subtle, extremely subtle. Part of the good news is that we can develop the subtlety of our sensitivity and be more and more aware of when [[clinging]] is there[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Clinging has an enormous range to it|.]] ^11-2
###### 11-3
Again, why do we keep going on about the sensitivity to the [[Embodiment|body]]? Because in this sensitivity to this region of [[energy]], this [[energy]] field, this feeling field, as I develop the sensitivity to that, as I keep the sensitivity and the [[awareness]] there, that [[Embodiment|body]] sense will reflect to me, will indicate to me when there's [[clinging]] around - holding, pushing, struggling, identifying - because some kind of [[contraction]] and tension comes into the [[Experience|bodily experience]], even if it's very subtle. Even if it's very subtle - in the belly, in the shoulders, in the back, just very, very, subtly in the [[Embodiment|whole body]] [[experience]] - and that can be our indicator of when there's [[clinging]]. And sometimes - even better news - we don't even know what we're [[clinging]] to, but just the releasing of the [[Embodiment|body]], the relaxing of the [[Embodiment|body]] sense, can release the [[clinging]] and open the heart[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#The body sense will indicate when there's clinging around|.]] ^11-3
###### 11-4
So one way of practising, another of these possibilities in our buffet is - again, you're doing the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice, you're doing the [[compassion]] practice, and again, you open up a bit more. And just to be aware, **use the [[Embodiment|body]] sense to be aware: "Is there [[clinging]] right now? Am I pushing, pulling, struggling with things, [[experience]], in the moment? If there is, can I relax that [[clinging]], let go of it, relax the [[Embodiment|body]], relax the [[clinging]]?" See what happens to the [[love]].** Again, it can kick-start the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ when it feels blocked, or like it's not really getting anywhere off the ground in any moment. Or it can deepen it. And one can actually - all of these, one can stay with them and let the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ deepen with them and through them[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Being sensitive to the body can kick-start metta or deepen it|.]] ^11-4
###### 11-5
[[Clinging]] - [[Aversion|pushing away]] what we don't like, pulling towards us and [[Craving|grasping]] on what we do like - as I said the other day, that builds [[the self]]-sense. So [[the self]]-sense is dependent on [[clinging]], and [[clinging]] is actually dependent on [[the self]]-sense. They're mutually dependent. The more self-sense, the more other-sense. Self and other go together - the more [[Nondualism|separation]], the less [[love]]. See how this all fits together, and why the [[Buddha]] just kept going on and on about this stuff[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#The self-sense is dependent on clinging|?]] ^11-5
###### 11-6
**(3)** So there's _[[Impermanence|anicca]]_, '[[impermanence]],' _[[dukkha]]_, '[[Dukkha|unsatisfactoriness]]' or '[[Dukkha|suffering]],' or how [[Dukkha|suffering]] arises through [[clinging]], and the last one is **_[[Anatta|anattā]]_**. So to say a bit about this, this **'[[Anatta|not-self]]'** teaching - it's really, really important to realize that, in [[Meditation|Dharma practice]], we're not setting out to destroy [[the self]], to explode [[the self]], to erase [[the self]], even to dissolve [[the self]] or to merge the [[The Self|sense of self]] with some cosmic being or cosmic sense of something. The other day I mentioned [[oneness]] in the talk, and the possibility of this sense of [[oneness]]. And sometimes there _can_ be a sense of the being opening and merging with something and a real sense of [[oneness]]. That's really beautiful, really precious, and really, really helpful. But it's still - it's a little bit different from this _[[Anatta|anattā]]_ business. It's extremely valuable, if and when it happens, to open to that, and have that change of [[perception]], and feel the [[beauty]] of that, and feel touched by that. But _[[Anatta|anattā]]_ is something different, and it's _not_ that that is what we're going for in [[Insight|understanding]] _[[Anatta|anattā]]_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#3 Anatta not-self|.]] ^11-6
###### 12-1
_[[Anatta|Anattā]]_ is, really, we want to understand something about the [[nature]] of [[the self]], understand it in a way that brings [[freedom]]. We want to understand something about what [[the self]] is, and how it is, in a way that brings [[freedom]] into our life. So going back to [[fear]] for a second, [[fear]] is based on this self-notion. Without belief in [[the self]], there can't really be [[fear]]. Where is the [[fear]] going to take root? It's around self. When we begin to understand, deeply and in the heart, this [[emptiness]] of self, we realize there's actually nothing real here to protect, to defend, to worry about, and [[fear]] gets released at a very deep level in our lives[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We want to understand something about what the self is and how it is in a way that brings freedom into our life|.]] ^12-1
###### 12-2
So we want to understand something about self, and it's actually not easy to understand, this teaching of _[[Anatta|anattā]]_. It's really not easy. I've never encountered anyone who gets it right away. And even if one can get it intellectually very quickly, it takes a long time for the heart and the being to absorb that [[Insight|understanding]] in a way that's bringing [[freedom]]. So it's tantalizing as a teaching. We hear it, and we sort of get it, and we want to understand it, and we get frustrated sometimes. Sometimes we grab hold of the [[Insight|understanding]] in a bit of the wrong way[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Anatta is difficult to grasp fully|.]] ^12-2
###### 12-3
There's a story from the [[Judaism|Jewish tradition]], and it's Yom Kippur, which in the [[Judaism|Jewish tradition]] is the holiest day of the year. It's the day of atonement, when you bare yourself to God, and you reflect on the year that's passed, and all the ways that you haven't lived up to your aspirations, and the goodness of being that God is asking of you, etc. And it's Yom Kippur, and a very serious, holy atmosphere in the synagogue. And the rabbi is there, and suddenly the rabbi sinks to his knees and starts beating his chest: "I am nothing, I am nothing, I am nothing." And a little while later, the cantor, the guy who leads the singing, sinks to his knees: "I am nothing, I am nothing, I am nothing." And then a little while after that, the janitor, the person who cleans the toilets, sinks to his knees: "I am nothing, I am nothing, I am nothing." And the cantor turns to the rabbi and says, "Look who thinks he's nothing!" [laughter] There's a way we can actually make more self out of this question of [[Anatta|not-self]]. It's like we grab hold of it, and we're going about it in the wrong way[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Story "Look who thinks he's nothing!"|.]] ^12-3
###### 12-4
Again, the [[Buddha]], usually - he does want us to understand this, understand something about [[the self]] that frees, but the most common way he goes about it is: is it possible to, again, practise a [[Ways of looking|way of looking]], a [[Ways of looking|way of looking]] that we're not familiar with? And in that [[Ways of looking|way of looking]] comes [[freedom]] and comes [[love]]. And it's really a practice. Again, in this buffet, some of you will be familiar with some of these ways already from particular ways you've approached [[Meditation|insight meditation]]. For others it might be quite new to hear this[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#In that way of looking comes freedom and love|.]] ^12-4
###### 12-5
**(vii)** What's the way in relation to _[[Anatta|anattā]]_? He wants you to practise a [[Ways of looking|way of looking]]. We _can_ **practise a [[Ways of looking|way of looking]] - regarding our [[experience]] as 'not me' and 'not mine,' '[[Anatta|not-self]].'** So typically, typical human [[consciousness]], something comes up, something comes into our [[experience]] - a thought, an emotion, a [[Embodiment|body]] sensation - and we regard it, without even thinking about it, oftentimes, without even realizing that we're doing it, sometimes, we regard it as 'me': "I _am_ that emotion. That's _how I am_. That's _who_ I am." Or 'mine': "That thought belongs to me. This [[Embodiment|body]] sensation belongs to me. This [[Embodiment|body]] belongs to me." The whole range of it, we identify, either identify or take ownership of. This is going on 99.9 per cent of the time of our waking and dreaming life. An incredible current of habitually identifying with, taking as 'me' or 'mine' our [[experience]], and particularly the [[Skandhas|five aggregates]] which John talked about: **(_a_)** the **[[Embodiment|body]]**, **(_b_)** the **feeling-tone** of [[experience]], pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, **(_c_)** our **[[Perception|perceptions]]**, **(_d_)** the whole range of our **mental thoughts and formations**, and moods and [[Mind state|mind states]] and [[emotions]], and **(_e_)** the **[[consciousness]]** itself, the [[awareness]] itself[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#g Aggregates are not me not mine|.]] ^12-5
###### 13-1
And - sometimes deliberately, sometimes we realize we're doing it; most of the time we don't - we're saying, "Me. Mine. This is me. This is mine." And the [[Buddha]] is saying, can you practise - it's a gradual thing to develop this practice - can you practise seeing it in the moment, as 'not me, not mine'? So a [[Embodiment|body]] sensation comes up, and it's 'just happening.' A thought comes up and it's 'just happening.' It's 'not me, not mine.' And one learns to actually look at the [[experience]] through a lens - instead of the lens of 'me, mine, me, mine, me, mine' - **look at the [[experience]] through a lens of 'it's just happening, it's not me, it's not mine.'** It's a practice. And again, what happens? It may seem paradoxical. What happens? [[Freedom]] and [[love]] are liberated in that way of relating. I'm talking about very real possibilities for practice. And again, for those with that [[experience]] or have got that way of practising already, you can drop that in as a backdrop for the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice. So you open the [[awareness]] up and just regard things as 'just happening,' as 'not me, not mine,' and into the [[experience]] comes more [[love]][[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Look at experience through a lens of "it's just happening"|.]] ^13-1
###### 13-2
One of the particular areas where we get entangled, and certainly on a [[Retreat|meditation retreat]], is self-judgment. So something comes up for us, or our practice feels difficult, or we're sitting here doing _[[Metta|mettā]]_, and then we get irritation, or [[aversion]], or some negative thoughts, and we judge that. We judge ourselves, and we measure ourselves: "How am I doing? How is my practice going?" Very normal. That measuring and judging and comparing is actually part of the [[nature]] of what self does. The way self builds itself is through judging, measuring, comparing, and evaluating[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Self-judgement|.]] ^13-2
###### 13-3
So to recognize that it's going to be part of the [[experience]]. It's going to be part of the [[experience]]. The question is, how can I relate to it in a way that's most helpful? That's a whole other subject, but first of all, one of the ways is just to keep doing the _[[Metta|mettā]]_. And realize that we have a [[habit]] of judging, of measuring ourselves, of comparing, of evaluating, and just to keep doing the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ is taking away the [[energy]] from that [[habit]] pattern and feeding what's more helpful: the _[[Metta|mettā]]_, _[[Metta|mettā]]_ to our self. But also, sometimes, to just see that these thoughts that we're judging, or this state of [[mind]], it's like they arise out of nowhere. They're 'just happening.' They're 'not me, not mine.' We take them to be 'me' or 'mine.' They're like a shooting star in the sky, in the night sky: it just appears out of nowhere and then disappears. The more we can begin to see things that way, the less identification, and the less dragged down we are in self-judgment, self-criticism, comparing, measuring, evaluating ourselves. So this is really a practice that we can develop[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#With metta you take away the energy from the pattern of self-judging|.]] ^13-3
###### 13-4
And one can do this business with the non-ownership of the [[Skandhas|aggregates]], you can do it with another being. So again, you're directing the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ to another being, and just say, "_Their_ [[Embodiment|body]] doesn't belong to them. Their [[feelings]], their [[emotions]], their thoughts, their [[consciousness]] - it's all ownerless. It's just stuff happening, stuff arising." And again, you get this sense of not much of a giver of [[love]], not much of a receiver of [[love]], and yet it deepens it, can deepen it[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Seeing the non-ownership of the aggregates can be also done with another being|.]] ^13-4
###### 13-5
Okay, so that's all I want to put out there today. Please take what feels helpful in all this. I've put a lot of information out there, and generally, in this [[retreat]], there's an awful lot of possibilities and information. It's important that you take what feels helpful, and the rest - to let it go, really let it go. I put a lot out there because people are very different. They have different histories and different backgrounds and different likes and dislikes and inclinations. Take what's helpful, one or two pieces, and let the rest go. It's important that you find ways of working that feel [[Juiciness|juicy]] and alive to you. And the rest, just leave it. You can come back to it another time, or you can just leave it. It's totally fine. Take what's helpful, and let the rest go[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Take what's helpful and let the rest go|.]] ^13-5
###### 14-1
Okay, so, we have some time if there are any questions about what I've said today or in the instructions, or what's been said by any of us over the days. Anything you want to ask about or comment on. ^14-1
###### 14-2
**Q1: taking or leaving the seven possibilities** ^14-2
###### 14-3
Yogi: Rob, would it be possible - those seven, just to briefly refer to them on the board, so that ... [?] ^14-3
###### 14-4
Rob: I'll try and write something, yeah. I'll try and come up with something. Yes, definitely. And remember, no one's going to do all seven [possibilities for working with the [[three characteristics]]]. If you leave all of it, if you don't go anywhere near it, and you just have what we've talked about so far, that's absolutely fantastic. I'm just talking about possibilities. You might take one, and at times use it - great. You might take two, and at times dip in with them - great. But I'll try and put something on the board, yeah[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#No one's going to do all seven possibilities for working with the three characteristics|.]] ^14-4
###### 14-5
**Q2: self and _[[Anatta|anattā]]_ in _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice; _[[Metta|mettā]]_ without object; forming [[the self]] to different degrees on the sliding scale of [[emptiness]]** ^14-5
###### 14-6
Yogi: Can I ask about different [[Ways of looking|ways of seeing]]? I was practising with my neutral person, and I think I was trying to find ways of making him more interesting. [laughter] And to start off with, it's kind of taking the way of, "Okay, what's it like to breathe with this person?" ^14-6
###### 14-7
Rob: Mm, lovely, yeah. Beautiful, beautiful. ^14-7
###### 14-8
Yogi: And I started finding that it was almost like - I felt like I might be _stalking,_ more so ... [laughter] And it also got too fixed. It felt like I was fixing them too much - how they were doing, how they do life, or who they were. And so I had a go at practising this _[[Anatta|anattā]]_ thing. And I found that I couldn't hold both. It felt too - it feels like _both_ are true, and so, I found I couldn't hold both. I couldn't actually hold the _[[Anatta|anattā]]_ for very long. So I went back; I tried to find a sort of slightly less _fixed_ way. But I'm just interested in, okay, there are different ways of viewing self, so how ...? You said something about things coexisting, and for me they didn't. The two of those didn't kind of exist that way. So how do you work with ...? ^14-8
###### 14-9
Rob: Good. So in other words, the two - you couldn't do both, meaning you couldn't keep the sense of their self and also the sense of their [[Anatta|not-self]]? Yeah, okay, thank you. Very important. So, anything is good. Anything is game in this [[retreat]] - well, within certain parameters, but ... [laughter] In other words, whatever feels helpful at a certain time. So your initial thing was, "Let's make them a bit more real, a bit more ..." And in a way, we make things real by fixing them in certain ways. What you could do, just on that level, is - I remember years ago, in a class, someone was playing with dressing their - I can't remember if it was their neutral person - dressing them up in different outfits. [laughter] And so, if you've got a visual imagination, you actually picture them in different outfits. And if you want, there can be quite a range of those outfits that gives them a range of - it doesn't fix them. So anything from army fatigues to sort of what one would wear - an ascot or something, and sort of hats with ... you know. I'm being silly, but you can play with how you see them just on a very mundane level. In other words, you said, "Oh, I'm fixing them in this kind of character, or this is how they do things." Maybe just broaden that. You _don't_ know, and just imagine them some other way. You understand[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We can make things real by fixing them in a certain ways like dressing them up in different outfits|?]] ^14-9
###### 15-1
This other part - you're quite right. What you find, if you do this enough, if you work with the _[[Anatta|anattā]]_ of someone, is that {quote as you contemplate someone's non-fixedness of self, their [[emptiness]] of self, they actually begin, in your [[consciousness]], they begin to blur. And you can't fix them and hold them. So that's actually really good. It's great. Now, two things can happen. One is, with that, there can still be a sense of [[love]]. It doesn't seem so fixed and so directed, but you just follow that sense of [[love]], and you stay with the sense of [[love]], and don't worry so much about exactly where you're directing it, okay? Does that make sense[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#As you contemplate the emptiness of someone they begin to blur|?]] ^15-1
###### 15-2
Yogi: I just lost them. They became completely blurred, and I just lost them. ^15-2
###### 15-3
Rob: Yeah. So I'm saying one option is - I'm going to give you two options. One option is to let them become lost and blurred. And either, like I was saying in the talk the other day, _they_ become blurred, but a sense of heart or [[consciousness]] or _being_ is still there ... No? Okay, not even that. Was there a sense of _[[Metta|mettā]]_ there at all[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#A sense of hear or being can still be there|?]] ^15-3
###### 15-4
Yogi: At that point, no. I just kind of went back to ... [?] ^15-4
###### 15-5
Rob: Okay. What you may find, sometimes, is that the person becomes blurred, the sense of them becomes blurred, but there's still a sense of _[[Metta|mettā]]_, and you can just feel into that and keep with that. And it's fine; you just have a vague sense of their beingness, or maybe _very,_ very vague, _very_, very blurred. But there's just a sense of _[[Metta|mettā]]_ that doesn't seem to have so much of an object. That's fine. That's actually good, and just to be in that _[[Metta|mettā]]_ that doesn't seem to have so much a sense of an object. Okay, that's one option[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#1 As the sense of the person becomes blurred you can still feel into a sense of metta|.]] ^15-5
###### 15-6
The other option, and this takes probably some practice, is that you can kind of _play_ - you will eventually find that you can play with how _formed_ you make someone. So you can play with kind of going into that [[emptiness]], but not too much, so you still keep them around a bit. You kind of see that they're empty, but you also don't go too far into that - you can kind of pull them back and forth on this sliding scale of [[emptiness]]. It might sound completely unreal, but it's actually a very real possibility. You can develop the control of that. So you kind of make them somewhat empty, but not [[Emptiness|completely empty]], so you've still got a sense of somewhere you can direct the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ towards. If you've got that far in the playing, you'll probably find that it's just a matter of time before you can play with that. Does that make sense[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#2 You can play with how formed you make someone|?]] ^15-6
###### 16-1
Yogi 2: Is that imagination? ^16-1
###### 16-2
Rob: Is that imagination? In what sense? ^16-2
###### 16-3
Yogi 2: I'm just wondering if that's not just visual imagination. ^16-3
###### 16-4
Rob: Oh. No, because it's coming out of a contemplation of their [[emptiness]]. You're _seeing -_ rather than just sort of imaginally scrubbing someone out like that, you're actually reflecting on the [[nature]] of their being, reflecting on the [[nature]] of their [[Skandhas|aggregates]], etc. And it's that reflection, without trying to manipulate any [[Image|images]] in any way - that itself. They begin to get much less defined. So it's something that's coming from a [[Ways of looking|way of seeing]] and a way of relating[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#It's not visual imagination because it's coming out of a contemplation of their emptiness|.]] ^16-4
###### 16-5
**Q3: _[[Metta|mettā]]_ leads to fearlessness** ^16-5
###### 16-6
Yogi: Thank you for your tangent on [[fear]]. That was very good and appropriate for me. And I realized the [[Buddha]], I think, is in the _[[Mudra|mudrā]]_ of teaching fearlessness. ^16-6
###### 16-7
Rob: Aha. I didn't know that. Thank you. Great. Good. ^16-7
###### 16-8
Yogi: I spoke to John about this; I asked whether this practice that we're doing can lead to fearlessness, or some elements of fearlessness, because - I mean, I personally find it very inhibitory, and also because of that, there are great losses attached to it. So thank you. ^16-8
###### 16-9
Rob: Good, you're welcome. As I said originally, the [[Buddha]] introduced this whole practice to a group of monks who were living in the forest and very, very afraid, living in the sort of wilderness in the forest. It was originally an antidote to [[fear]]. So can it lead to fearlessness? Absolutely, absolutely[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Originally the Buddha introduced metta an an antidote to fear|.]] ^16-9
###### 16-10
**Q4: availability of recordings** ^16-10
###### 16-11
Yogi: I just wanted to ask, the talks, are we able to get hold of them? ^16-11
###### 16-12
Rob: Yeah. That's this ... Just checking the microphone's on! [laughter] We haven't got a very good track record in this [[retreat]] of recording, but yes, they will be available. ^16-12
###### 16-13
Yogi: Are they only available, like, to download? Or can we actually ... ^16-13
###### 16-14
Rob: No, I don't think they're actually available to download. There will be discs, and I think CD or MP3 is how they'll be available at the end of the [[retreat]], and you can order. ^16-14
###### 17-1
Yeah. And that's actually a good point. In a talk like I gave today, partly - I don't know if it's sensible or not, but sometimes I feel like I'm almost ... There's so much information, and partly, in a way, one is giving it to the tape recorder, because I know it's too much to take in in one go. And one's bombarding - you've had instructions this morning already. And so it's almost like, "Yeah, take the tape, and just take a few pieces out." In a way, that's just going to give a lot of stuff that you can - you can go with this for years, years. You get to see, three weeks is a pretty short amount of time to investigate this stuff. You _could_ come for three months or three years, and you'd still be busy with the depth of all this and the range of all this. So it's really important that the tape is there, if you feel interested, and you begin to, "What was that thing he was going on about ...?" Or you're doing your best to pay [[attention]], but it's just too much, just kind of going over the head right now. And that's one of the occupational hazards of this stuff. But I prefer to put a lot out, and hopefully people pick different pieces. But great that we have the tapes so that you _can_ refer back to them. Don't worry, as I said, if you feel like, "Oh gosh, I only got about 3 per cent of what you just said." It's totally fine[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#I prefer to put a lot out and hopefully people pick different pieces|.]] ^17-1
###### 17-2
**Q5: writing notes during talks** ^17-2
###### 17-3
Yogi: And it's okay to write notes? ^17-3
###### 17-4
Rob: Totally okay to write notes as well. And actually, I like it when people write notes. Not that you have to, but it shows me that people are actually still awake. [laughter] Unless you're writing a shopping list or something. [laughter] It's very good. And it's an interesting thing, with a page of something, if we transcribe the talk, you can always just flip to that page, whereas with a talk you actually have to go through it in time, and it's hard to pull out the pieces - especially in a talk like today, which is basically a long, fat instruction talk, in a lot of respects. It's hard to pull out pieces when you have to go through a whole - whatever it was - an hour I talked for. Sometimes seeing it in a written page, you can just find that place, "Ah, that's exactly what I want." It's actually more helpful[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#If we transcribe the talk you can always just flip to that page|.]] ^17-4
###### 17-5
**Q6: when to use [[insight]] practices; responsiveness** ^17-5
###### 17-6
Yogi: The [[mind]] can only do one thing at the same time, right? ^17-6
###### 17-7
Rob: Uhh ... [laughs] Well, say a bit more. ^17-7
###### 17-8
Yogi: Another teacher suggested this, so on the _vipassanā_ [[retreat]] in India. So whatever you do, you move between one thing and another, somehow, like what you just asked about. Is it so or not? So that you can play around, and it doesn't actually fragment the [[mind]], as long as you play around with things that, together, those ingredients will support _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ somehow? ^17-8
###### 17-9
Rob: Can you be a bit more specific? ^17-9
###### 18-1
Yogi: No, I can't. I'm just wondering about, how can it work in such a way that when you offer all these elaborations - can they help you to come to a greater sense of wholeness more quickly somehow, because the [[Insight|understanding]] deepens and the heart opens, right? And brings it together if the ingredients are right. Or is it so that the [[mind]] can only do one thing at the same time? I think the question is, can the [[mind]] do more than one thing at the same time, if you're in _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_? Because somehow, when I am in a sense of wholeness, it seems like the [[mind]] can do anything; the thoughts can come in, and it doesn't bother me. Right? But if I'm not, and I'm already really scattered, or [?]. But to myself - or I was lost. You know, and it's all very fragmented. Is it then better not to invite all those elaborations? ^18-1
###### 18-2
Rob: Okay. I think I understand. It's interesting. Some people may hear some of what I've talked about today and say, "Well, my [[mind]] is too scattered; I need to get the basics down." And there's something to say about that. When the [[mind]], as you say, has some degree of _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_, some degree of [[Samadhi|collectedness]], it's much more malleable. We find, "Oh, I can play with this. I can pull this piece in. I can do more than one thing at once," because there's openness, there's presence, there's malleability in the [[mind]]. We can shape what's going on. But it may also be that we feel a bit unconnected, and the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ is not going very well, the _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ is not going very well, and you pick up one of these pieces, and you just try doing that, and it actually helps to kick-start. So generally speaking, it's probably better to wait until there's some degree of _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ and some degree of [[Samadhi|collectedness]], and you feel like, "It's going okay. Let me drop some of this in." But it may equally work that it just helps to kick-start when it feels a bit blocked. Can the [[mind]] do more than one thing at once? In _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_, you could say it could, yeah, when that's around. Yeah. So it's not going to this and then to this; it's more like, in the expanse of things, holding things together, and learning to do that[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#It's usually better to wait until there's some degree of samadhi before doing insight practice|.]] ^18-2
###### 18-3
Yogi: Because it could lead to more fragmentation, or it could have the other effect. ^18-3
###### 18-4
Rob: It could. Yeah. And if it leads to more fragmentation, leave it, and come back to what's much simpler. So all of this, again, is in the context of responsiveness. You do something, and if it works, great. Do it more. Go for it. Do it deeper. Experiment. If you try something and it feels like, "Well, that took a nosedive," you know, go back to what's simpler, what's easier, what helps. Is that answering[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#If it leads to more fragmentation leave it and come back to what's much simpler|?]] ^18-4
###### 18-5
Yogi: Yeah. Thanks. ^18-5
###### 18-6
Rob: Good. You're welcome. ^18-6
###### 18-7
**Q7: incorporating _[[Anatta|anattā]]_ into _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice** ^18-7
###### 18-8
Yogi: Rob, I've done, as you know, a little bit of using the phrase "not me, not mine" to look directly at [[experience]]. I was wondering, when you're doing the _[[Anatta|anattā]]_ sort of slant on _[[Metta|mettā]]_, do you incorporate the phrase into the phrases of _[[Metta|mettā]]_? "May - not me! - be happy ..." [laughter] ^18-8
###### 19-1
Rob: Careful you don't get it wrong - "May I _not_ be happy!" [laughter] It's a tricky one. You'll have to find what works. What I find is if you stay with just the "not me, not mine" as a very light thing, but let the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ phrases go, but keep the intention of the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ around. So it's like you're holding both things at once. It can seem very complicated, but it doesn't need to be. So you just drop the "not me, not mine" in, as a very, very [light] whisper of a phrase, in the context of the intention for [[love]] and wanting to feel when that [[love]] is there, and then _feel_ the [[love]]. So you're interested in feeling the [[love]] that comes out of it, but you can let the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ phrases go at that point, yeah. But experiment. I wouldn't put them in in the way of, "May - not me!" No, it's more - you might be down to just a word at that point, so "happy" or "peaceful," you know, and that's going on at the same time. But experiment and see. You may be doing the whole thing without any words at all, not even the "not me, not mine" or the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ phrases. A lot of this is playing, playing with it and finding out what happens. Is that enough? Yeah? Good, okay[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Drop in "not me not mine" very lightly wanting to feel the love|.]] ^19-1
###### 19-2
Okay, is there anything else? ^19-2
###### 19-3
**Q8: [[letting go]] of words; trusting in one's own practice; [[Embodiment|body]] sensitivity** ^19-3
###### 19-4
Yogi: I think I find that the more words, the further away I am. And so, the faster I can let go of the words, the better. ^19-4
###### 19-5
Rob: Yeah, yeah. To work in the way that feels the most helpful, absolutely, and not to assume that you have to keep trundling the phrases out and that that's what _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice is. It's not. As I said right at the beginning, _[[Metta|mettā]]_ is not a technique. We're interested in technique, but what we're interested in is finding the technique and the approach that works for you. If, for the most part, that means no words, you're not alone in that. You're absolutely not alone in that. Just to recognize, "That's how it is for me right now." Totally fine. It's more that the intention and the opening and the inclination towards _[[Metta|mettā]]_ is being nourished. That's all[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#You don't have to keep trundling the phrases out|.]] ^19-5
###### 19-6
Yogi: Some of what you've been talking about, tweaking, and the different [[ways of looking]] at it, are easier then ... ^19-6
###### 19-7
Rob: Without the words? ^19-7
###### 19-8
Yogi: It's just, there are no words. ^19-8
###### 19-9
Rob: Yeah, sure. There can be more space, and more space in the [[mind]], and that's easier. ^19-9
###### 19-10
Yogi: I just trip over my tongue, so to speak. ^19-10
###### 19-11
Rob: You may well, yeah. So you know what's good for you, and that's good, and you just go with that. Yeah. Just to trust yourself with that - yeah, I think that's important. To be enough in contact with one's [[experience]] that one trusts, "This is working for me, and I know it is, and it's okay. And I trust that." That's really important, to trust one's own practice, what one sees and feels for oneself in one's own practice[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#You know what's good for you just go with that|.]] ^19-11
###### 20-1
Yogi: But you've said before that _[[Metta|mettā]]_ can kind of come from anywhere, like the head, the big toe, whatever. But again, I think, for me, it's getting out of the head that's the big one. ^20-1
###### 20-2
Rob: So this [[Embodiment|body]] sensitivity that I've been talking about - it's very important. And putting the [[awareness]], just gently keep putting it other places - belly, heart [[centre]], etc. And the more you do that with that sensitivity, the more the [[energy]], the more the [[awareness]] kind of rests there, takes its [[centre]] there. And then it can radiate from there. That's great. Good[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Keep putting the awareness in other places than the head|.]] ^20-2
###### 20-3
**Q9: interpreting and working with [[Experience|bodily experience]] in different ways** ^20-3
###### 20-4
Yogi: I feel like my [[Embodiment|body]] is lying to me. I had this lump in my throat, and now it has been there for three days. But now I'm thinking that I have only a sore throat! [laughter] But it's so much to believe that I'm doing really bad now. So do you have any suggestions for how to practise with it in [[meditation]]? ^20-4
###### 20-5
Rob: I think so. What you're describing is actually really common. Something comes up in our [[experience]], particularly our [[experience]] of the [[Embodiment|body]], and we tend to interpret it in a certain way, in the way we're looking at it. And in so doing, we perceive it a certain way, and that actually can become self-fulfilling. So sore throat - "Oh, feels like a lump in the throat." And then actually we _begin_ to feel miserable. I remember having a very irritated eye once, and tearing, and feeling sad. This was years ago. And there was nothing going on emotionally, but it was just, somehow the association of that physical sensation and the way I was looking at it and interpreting it. So, again, a couple of options[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Perceiving the body in a certain way can become self-fulfilling|.]] ^20-5
###### 20-6
One option is, actually, wipe the slate clean a little bit and say, "I don't _know_ what this thing is." And so it's possible sometimes to leave the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ and just approach the throat, just openly, and just be with those sensations. This is more [[insight]] practice territory, but just be with those sensations in a very light, very delicate way, so you're just holding them. And in a way, in the context of this [[retreat]], you're just holding them in [[Metta|kindness]], and just letting them be there, but feeling into them, and seeing if it begins to tell you about an emotion or not. That's one option[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#1 just be with those sensations|.]] ^20-6
###### 20-7
The other option in the context of this [[retreat]] is, "Okay, something going on in the throat - I'll put my [[attention]] elsewhere." And so, another area of the [[Embodiment|body]], maybe the heart area or the belly, may actually feel really okay, or comfortable, or even warm and open. And we keep getting dragged into what's a little bit problematic. Like a magnet, we go there. And if possible, just keeping it where it's okay. So they're kind of opposite suggestions, and you can play with them both. In the second one, it may be that you can find a place where it's okay, and actually just radiate the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ from there, or feel the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ from there. And eventually, it washes over everything[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#2 put attention elsewhere|.]] ^20-7
###### 20-8
So it's important, I think, to keep open to them both, because sometimes there _is_ something going on emotionally, and we need to connect with it and hold it and explore it. Other times, it's just the way that we've gotten into perceiving and interpreting things, and we need to kind of go away from that. Does that answer? Yeah[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Keep open to both options|?]] ^20-8
###### 21-1
Yogi: Yeah, that makes sense. If my arm feels good, I just have to make my arms stronger? ^21-1
###### 21-2
Rob: That's one option. Rather than making them stronger, it's more like just letting the [[attention]] rest there, and enjoy that they feel good, rather than getting pulled into what feels difficult all the time. It's the [[attention]] and the [[Pleasantness|enjoyment]] which allows the [[awareness]] to kind of rest there and get into that more[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#It's the attention and the enjoyment which allows the awareness to rest|.]] ^21-2
###### 21-3
**Q10: concerns that [[insight]] might negate _[[Metta|mettā]]_; connecting with [[emotions]] and seeing [[emptiness]] as two wings of practice** ^21-3
###### 21-4
Yogi: I was just thinking that part of my _[[Metta|mettā]]_ practice is to introduce or open up just more to my [[feelings]]. I was just a bit concerned that if I introduce, along with that, the recognition that this is [[Anatta|not-self]] or this is [[Impermanence|impermanent]], that might negate that process somehow. Maybe the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ itself could be negated. ^21-4
###### 21-5
Rob: Right. Yeah. Very important question. Again, kind of stepping back and taking a big view. If we think, "What's involved in this life of practice? What's involved in the long run in terms of practice?" One wing of it is learning how to open to ourselves, learning how to open to our [[emotions]] - how to be with them, how to acknowledge them, how to feel them, how to respect them, how to connect with them. That's very much a part of what can develop, or what we can rediscover in our practice: really reconnecting with the emotional life and honouring that. That's what I hear you saying[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#One wing of longterm practice is learning how to open to ourselves|.]] ^21-5
###### 21-6
And a whole other wing is this business about [[emptiness]]. Sometimes, you're quite right that bringing in a reflection of "not me, not mine, [[Anatta|not-self]]," etc., does tend to kind of dissolve whatever emotion is there. Now, it's almost like holding both these wings at once. If all one ever did, or all one ever could do in one's practice is just dissolve [[emotions]], and one didn't really have the skill and the capacity, or the willingness, or the fearlessness to be with [[emotions]] and feel them, and be able to hold oneself in the [[emotions]], and connect with one's [[emotions]] - if all one had was [[emptiness]], it would be like a bird with one wing trying to fly. It's not going to get anywhere. It's not going to get off the ground, or it will just go round in circles[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#A whole other wing is understanding emptiness - birds need two wings|.]] ^21-6
###### 21-7
If all one had was a very beautiful ability to be open with one's emotional life, to connect with it, to respect it, to express it, to hold it, to [[love]] one's emotional life, to be clear about what's going on in one's emotional life - if all one had was _that_, again, like a bird with just one wing. One is missing the whole other half of practice. I think you're talking about a long term of practice, to really learn to hold these two together and kind of, "Do I understand both? Have I got skill in both? Am I really open to my [[emotions]], but can I also kind of let go of that whole arena of [[emotions]] and see beyond it in that way?" To have both - again, we're talking about quite a mature practice - is it possible? Absolutely. Some people feel, "Well, I have to do one before I do another." I'm not sure if that's possible. You may have periods in your life where you're encouraging one more than another, and that's fine, and right now might be a period where you're actually wanting to respect the [[emotions]] more and be with the [[emotions]] more, and that's totally fine - in which case, maybe shelve the other stuff for another time[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#You may have periods in your life where you're encouraging one more than another|.]] ^21-7
###### 22-1
Yogi: Is it about appropriateness, then? ^22-1
###### 22-2
Rob: It's about, again, what's appropriate and helpful right now for you. In a way, sometimes we need to have an overview and quite a large view of our whole life and practice, which can be difficult, you know. "Where has my life been? Have I been an avoider of [[emotions]]? Have I been too wrapped up and entangled in [[emotions]]?" And then seeing, "What do I know how to do? What do I need to develop?" So you're asking a very big question. Do you see that[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Have I been an avoider of emotions Or too wrapped up and entangled in emotions What do I need to develop|?]] ^22-2
###### 22-3
Yogi: Yeah. What I'm trying to find out is, where is this [[Middle Way]]? ^22-3
###### 22-4
Rob: You have, again, a couple of options. One is to just know what you're doing at any time, and sometimes say, "I'm just going to really respect the emotion and go into it and feel it, not do anything with it, to accept, feel it, and open to it, and hold myself in that, connect with it." Sometimes you do that. At other times you can explore some of these ways I've talked about [[letting go]]. Sometimes you'll find that beautiful [[emotions]] deepen with that. But more difficult [[emotions]] tend to dissolve. Sometimes you'll find that. But you can have a choice, even on this [[retreat]], just as long as you know what you're doing when[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#1 respect the emotion and feel it|.]] ^22-4
###### 22-5
Or the second option - this is totally valid - is you can just shelve one of them for a while and just say, "I know I need to get to the other one, and I'll get to it sometime, but not on this [[retreat]]." So both of those would be the [[Middle Way]] - the [[Middle Way]] meaning aware that they're both important in one's life, and one needs to learn how to do both. Without both, the practice hasn't really opened into its maturity. Exactly how you go about that, you have two options there. Does that make sense? Yeah? Good, okay[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#2 shelve the emotion for later|.]] ^22-5
###### 22-6
**Q11: ability to move between different [[Ways of looking|ways of seeing]] as the mark of mature practice** ^22-6
###### 22-7
Yogi: It sort of feels like there's been quite a lot about whether things can coexist or whether they kind of happen one after the other. Are you saying that the kind of mark of a really mature practice would be that things _do_ coexist, and we can hold them both, like whatever truth they are, and before then it's kind of like sometimes you have to shelve one thing ... or what? ^22-7
###### 22-8
Rob: We're going to get onto this in the third week, but if we just talk about [[emptiness]], I'll just say something now. I hope it doesn't confuse. But when you contemplate [[emptiness]] in certain ways, things disappear. So problematic [[emotions]] disappear; objects disappear from [[consciousness]]. It's said that only a [[Buddha]], only a fully [[Awakening|enlightened]] [[Buddha]] - not even an [[Awakening|arahant]] - just a [[Buddha]] is able to contemplate [[emptiness]] and actually keep the object around at the same time. What I meant by "mature practice" was more that we're able to move between different [[Ways of looking|ways of seeing]] things. And a [[Ways of looking|way of seeing]] is just that - it's not ultimately true. It's just a [[Ways of looking|way of seeing]]. In some instances or some interactions or some inner environments or situations, it's most helpful to see in one way. Here we've had an argument, and you and I have had an argument about something, and there's a difficulty, and I come to you, and I say, "Hey, Elizabeth, it's all empty." You're probably going to punch me. [laughter] What certain situations need is very relative, conventional language. We need to talk about our [[emotions]]; we need to express what we feel to each other; we need to respect that. I need to respect my [[emotions]] and your [[emotions]] at that level. So in that moment, that's what's helpful, that [[Ways of looking|way of looking]]. But I'm saying a mature practice is able to move between picking that up, putting it down, picking up other [[Ways of looking|ways of seeing]] - [[emptiness]], _[[Anatta|anattā]]_, etc. - and putting them down, not getting stuck in one or the other. Does that make sense[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Maturity in practice comes from being able to move between different ways of seeing|?]] ^22-8
###### 23-1
Yogi: That answered my question, Rob. ^23-1
###### 23-2
Rob: Okay, good, good. It's a tall order. Not to underestimate - I'm talking about quite a large span of time that one would develop this in. But it's definitely possible, it's absolutely possible, and it's there, again, as a potential and as a possibility for us as human beings and as practitioners. ^23-2
###### 23-3
**Q12: seeing [[emptiness]] brings about [[letting go]] of [[Craving|grasping]], [[Emptiness|fading]] of difficulty, and deepening of [[happiness]]** ^23-3
###### 23-4
Yogi: Rob, when you said that the bad things, when we really look closely at them, tend to disappear, and the good ones tend to increase, why is that? ^23-4
###### 23-5
Rob: Okay. [laughter] We're going to get into this in the third week. So we do a week on [[Metta|loving-kindness]], a week on [[compassion]], and a week on what all this has to do with [[emptiness]] and all that. So usually, when there's something difficult around, an emotion that's difficult, or even a [[Embodiment|body]] sensation that's difficult, or anything that's difficult, we tend to think, "Well, that thing exists, and then I can relate to it in any way that I choose to." Or maybe I can't choose, but I relate to it. So there's a thing, and then the relationship we have with it[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We think there is a thing and then the relationship we have with it|.]] ^23-5
###### 23-6
As we go deeper into [[Insight|understanding]], Dharmic [[Insight|understanding]], one realizes that the thing - it's a bit like what I was saying with [[fear]] - the thing and our relationship to it are actually not separate. So the way that I'm looking, and my relationship, is something that _feeds_, is part of what creates and feeds and shapes and colours any object in the [[present moment]]. So an object doesn't exist independently of the way I'm looking at it, and the way I'm relating to it[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#But the thing and our relationship are actually not separate|.]] ^23-6
###### 23-7
Sometimes we can sit there and say, "I'm being [[Mindfulness|mindful]]. I'm being [[Mindfulness|mindful]]. I'm being [[Mindfulness|mindful]]," but actually there's a subtle [[aversion]] wrapped up in that [[mindfulness]], or a subtle [[Craving|grasping]]. And we don't actually realize it. That subtle [[aversion]] or [[Craving|grasping]] is enough to keep something difficult going, because the [[aversion]] is part of what's feeding it. You understand[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Example subtle aversion in mindfulness|?]] ^23-7
###### 23-8
As we begin to learn to let go of that [[aversion]], for instance, or [[Craving|grasping]], or identification, we begin to let go of certain factors, we're actually taking away some of what is building an [[experience]]. And so, it begins to [[Emptiness|fade]]. Difficult things are held in place, basically, by [[aversion]], by [[Craving|grasping]], by identification, by all these things we're talking about [[letting go]] of. So as you let go of them, they tend to [[Emptiness|fade]]. [[Happiness]], at one level, or peace, or [[Happiness|joy]], is also held in place by [[Craving|grasping]], to an extent. But it's a more subtle kind of [[Craving|grasping]]. What one finds is that if one lets go of the [[Craving|grasping]] towards [[happiness]], the [[happiness]] actually deepens. It becomes more refined. So it goes from, for instance, a very sort of bubbly [[happiness]] to a more peaceful [[happiness]]. It's dependent - because we're not holding it in place by the way we're looking and relating. Does that make sense, or have I confused ...? No? Okay. We're going to talk a lot about this in the third week[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#When we let go we're actually taking away some of what is building an experience and it begins to fade|.]] ^23-8
###### 24-1
**Q13: no thing exists independently of a [[consciousness]] that shapes, colours, and [[Fabrication|fabricates]] it; assumptions around '[[Attention|bare attention]]' and 'naked [[awareness]]'; struggles in life depend on belief in independent existence** ^24-1
###### 24-2
Yogi: Does that mean they exist outside of ourselves? ^24-2
###### 24-3
Rob: Well, ultimately, no. That's what all this is pointing to: nothing exists in a way outside of one's self, outside of what one's bringing to that. So it's a different question than, "If a tree falls in the forest, and there's no one around, does it make a noise?" It's not going there, to that question. It's avoiding that question. We're talking about [[experience]] and [[Insight|understanding]] [[experience]] in the light of [[Dukkha|suffering]] arising or not. So it's very personal, experiential, very real for us. We're not asking abstract philosophical questions about that. That's very important in terms of the [[Dharma|Buddhist path]][[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Nothing exists outside of what one's bringing to that|.]] ^24-3
###### 24-4
Yogi: So if you get to the point - this is hypothetical - you get to the point where you could let go of that subtle [[Craving|grasping]] and [[clinging]], so that your [[perception]] didn't colour the object in any way whatsoever, is that what you would call 'naked [[awareness]]'[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Yogi Is letting go completely "naked awareness"|?]] ^24-4
###### 24-5
Rob: Okay. So this ... [laughs] Tea is late today, by the way, because of her. [laughter] No, no, this is great. This is great. There aren't many better questions than what you're asking and what's being asked. These are the real - they end up being the kind of deepest questions that a [[Personhood|human being]] can ask about life. At the moment it might seem a bit cerebral and everything, but they're actually really important, deep questions. Eventually, all practice leads to these kind of questions, and really seeing them for ourselves, because the [[Insight|understanding]], as I keep saying, leads to [[freedom]] and [[love]]. There's nothing about being clever here; it's just that the outcome of going into these questions is really [[Freedom|deep freedom]] and very deep [[love]]. We'll definitely, as I said, revisit this very strongly in the third week[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Rob The oucome of going into these questions is deep freedom and love|.]] ^24-5
###### 24-6
But when we talk about [[Meditation|insight meditation]] and [[mindfulness]] practice, it carries with it an assumption of naked [[awareness]] or [[Attention|bare attention]]. It's actually a word that the [[Buddha]] didn't use. It's not there in the [[Sutta|suttas]], if you read the [[Sutta|suttas]]. It's not there. It might be there once, or it might not even be there once[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#"Bare attention" is not mentioned in the suttas|.]] ^24-6
###### 24-7
Yogi: Which one? Naked [[awareness]]? ^24-7
###### 24-8
Rob: Well, same. Naked [[awareness]] or [[Attention|bare attention]]. Yeah, same, same. It can be really helpful as a concept: "My [[mind]] is all over the place. I'm aware that I'm projecting all kinds of things onto people and experiences, etc. I'm colouring things. I'm distorting things in all ways. Let me see if I can be [[Mindfulness|mindful]], be very simple in the [[awareness]], and get underneath all those views and opinions, likes and dislikes, distortions and [[Image|images]], and preconceptions. Underneath, I'll meet the [[experience]] with as naked an [[awareness]] as possible." That's part of what we tend to call "[[mindfulness]]," and the assumption is that there is such a thing and that one can get to a point where one is not colouring objects in any way, and then one has arrived at, "That's how the object really is. That's how it is. This is it. This is _things as they are_," which is also a phrase that's very popular in the [[Dharma]], "things as they are," and actually a phrase that the [[Buddha]] used. But that's not what he meant when he used it - "things as they are.[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#With naked awareness our assumption is that we can get to things as they are|"]] ^24-8
###### 25-1
Rather, what he meant - "things as they are" - you cannot find a [[consciousness]], a state of [[mind]], a moment of [[consciousness]], that is not shaping or creating or colouring or [[Fabrication|fabricating]] an [[experience]]. We tend to think, "Well, [[mindfulness]] is this sort of midpoint where you've got rid of all this other stuff." Or we think, "Yeah, [[equanimity]] is that." But when you really go into it, there's no such thing. The very [[nature]] of [[consciousness]] itself is that it's always creating an object and shaping, colouring - '[[Fabrication|fabricating]]' is the [[Buddha]]'s word - [[Fabrication|fabricating]] an object. As such, there is no place to stand where you see a thing as it is _independently of the way I'm looking at it_. What we're doing in this [[retreat]], what we're leading up towards, is using [[love]] and [[compassion]] as a [[Ways of looking|way of seeing]] that. It doesn't sound obvious at first, but it will hopefully become clear. [laughter] It _will_ come clear. [laughter] It will come clear[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#There is no moment of consciousness that is not shaping or creating or colouring or fabricating an experience|.]] ^25-1
###### 25-2
Yogi 2: We have [[Devotion|faith]]. [laughter] ^25-2
###### 25-3
Yogi 3: So, Rob, does that mean the [[craving]] and [[aversion]] around an object, or just the - you know, I see a green and yellow thing, and I think I see primrose and ... So, do you mean both discrimination and ...? ^25-3
###### 25-4
Rob: The whole level of it, as you go deeper into it, the whole [[nature]] of [[perception]] begins to be unravelled, and the assumption that things exist independent of the way we're looking at them is seen to be a falsehood. It's just not true. To understand that, that's what it means to understand [[emptiness]]. That's exactly what it means, and that's what the [[Buddha]] taught: liberating [[insight]]. That's exactly what he taught, what he meant. So when the [[Buddha]] uses the words "things as they are," what he means, what he meant, was "things as they are" - it's _dependent_, dependent co-arising. They don't exist independently. To see a thing as it is means to really recognize - and again, totally in one's heart, one really knows - that it doesn't exist independently. We struggle with things in life partly because we believe that they exist independently: "This knee [[pain]] - that's _really_ what it is. It really hurts. It really hurts exactly this amount. It's not that bad, but it's quite bad." And we believe it exists independently, and then we struggle with things. At a very deep level, when we begin to undermine that belief in the independent existence of things, then our whole sense of reality is opened up. It's almost as if [[Dukkha|suffering]] can't land anywhere; we can't land anywhere to struggle with anything. Or we believe that less and less, put it that way. And then comes more and more a sense of [[freedom]], and [[love]] comes. It will become clearer in time what the [[hell]] this has got to do with [[love]] and [[compassion]]. But there's a reason we put it at the third week. But it's coming up now, and it's fine. We're moving in that direction[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#The whole nature of perception begins to be unravelled|.]] ^25-4
###### 26-1
**Q14: relief as a mark of [[insight]]** ^26-1
###### 26-2
Yogi: I was just thinking, relief in case of [[pain]] ... ^26-2
###### 26-3
Rob: Yes, yeah. Absolutely. And relief is a mark of [[insight]], yeah, the feeling of relief is a mark of [[insight]][[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#The feeling of relief is a mark of insight|.]] ^26-3
###### 26-4
So, _if_ there's someone who doesn't understand this right now ... [laughs] Just kidding. If you ... [laughter] If this isn't totally crystal clear right now, don't worry. Going back to - I think I started the talk on _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ saying, when we were conceiving of this [[retreat]], I had a good think about it and thought, "What's a person going to get out of this?" You can't go wrong. So it may be that we get to the end of the three weeks, and all this stuff about [[emptiness]] is "I've got it." [snaps fingers] "I've really understood." Great. Fantastic. I really hope that's the case. It may be that it didn't _quite_ ... That's okay too. You'll still have developed the [[Metta|loving-kindness]] and [[compassion]]. It's still moving towards [[awakening]]. And still there will have been the development of _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_. It's all in there. You cannot fail here. And we're not grading people either, so ... [laughter] We're going to talk about it more and more. It will come together[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#In this retreat you cannot fail loving-kindness samadhi emptiness all moving towards awakening|.]] ^26-4
###### 26-5
Okay. Let's sit just for a minute or two together. ^26-5
