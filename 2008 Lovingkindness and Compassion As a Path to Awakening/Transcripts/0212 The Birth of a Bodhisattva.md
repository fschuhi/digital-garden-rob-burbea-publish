[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva]]

---
<br/>

###### 1-1
In the tradition, in the [[Buddhism|Buddhist tradition]], the [[Dharma]] traditions, there is the concept and the idea of the [[bodhisattva]]. And that's been actually around since the beginning. And about 500, between 500 and 1,000 years - my maths isn't very good, but _a while_ after the [[Buddha]] died ... [laughter] It gained quite a central significance and a slightly different meaning. And what it came to mean in the tradition was someone who aspired very highly with two central aspirations. And one was the aspiration of [[compassion]], of boundless [[compassion]], and serving life, serving other beings. And the other was - and sometimes this is, interestingly, neglected - to fully understand the [[Emptiness|emptiness of all things]], of all [[Phenomenon|phenomena]]. And those two together - so it's the [[compassion]] and the [[Insight|wisdom]] together - make up that aspiration to live that way, to fulfil both of those potentials, make up the [[bodhisattva]]. And actually it was originally meant as someone who vowed to become a [[Buddha]] in a future life. But this came about historically - and historians are a little bit unclear when exactly it emerged and how it emerged and where it emerged in the tradition. But it was felt among, obviously, certain practitioners that a while after the [[Buddha]]'s [[death]], there was not quite a full enough [[Insight|understanding]] of what the [[Buddha]] originally said - and so that's where the [[emptiness]] piece comes in - and also that somehow the emphasis on [[compassion]] had slipped a little bit, and a lot of people were practising just for themselves. So this [[rebirth]] of the emphasis on [[compassion]] and fullness of [[Insight|understanding]] on [[emptiness]][[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Two central aspirations for a bodhisattva boundless compassion and understanding emptiness|.]] ^1-1
###### 1-2
So a [[bodhisattva]] is really someone who is totally devoted to [[compassion]], who lives their life with [[compassion]] at the [[centre]], at the core of their priority. Their whole life is kind of revolving around [[compassion]], revolving around the wish, the [[desire]], to serve others. There's a text by [[Shantideva|Śāntideva]], I think eighth century, quite some years after the [[Buddha]]'s [[death]], and in a way, it's the epitome of the sort of expression of this aspiration. There are a few extracts from this I'd like to read. Has anyone read from this on this [[retreat]] - no, one of us teachers on this [[retreat]]? It's expressing this yearning, this wish, this surrender to the centrality of [[compassion]], and the movement of [[compassion]] in one's life[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#A Bodhisattva lives their life with compassion at the centre of their priority|.]] ^1-2

> I am medicine for the sick and weary. May I be their physician and their nurse until disease appears no more.<br/>May I strike down the anguish of thirst and hunger with rains of food and drink. May I be food and drink to them in famine and disaster.<br/>May I be an inexhaustible treasure for those in need. May I be their servant to give them all they desire.</br>My [[Embodiment|body]], my pleasure, my merit, now and forever, everywhere - I care nothing for them. I cast them aside to accomplish the aim of beings...[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Santideva expressing this yearning to surrender to the centrality of compassion|.]] ^1-3

> May I be a protector for the unprotected, a guide for wanderers, a boat, a bridge, a causeway for those who [[desire]] the other shore, a lamp for those who need a lamp, a bed for those who need a bed, a slave for those who need a slave for all beings.<br/>May I be a wishing gem, an inexhaustible vase, a magic spell, a great medicine, a wish-fulfilling tree, a cow of plenty for all beings.<br/>As the elements of earth and water and fire and air are for the use of all beings who dwell in all of space, in many ways may I be the means of sustenance for the realm of beings in all of space until all have passed into _[[Unfabricated|nirvāṇa]] ..._<br/>By my merit ... May the blind see and the deaf hear ... the fearful cease to tremble, the afflicted be consoled and the weary be made content.<br/>May the sick be made whole again, those in bondage freed. May the weak be strong and loving to each other... <br/>And as long as the earth and sky shall last, may I remain here to heal the sorrows of the world. ^2-1
###### 2-2
> I take upon myself the sorrows of the world. May the world be happy.^[BCA 3:7-10, 3:17-20, 10:15, 10:19, 10:21-2, 10:55-6. Cf. Śāntideva, _A Guide to the Bodhisattva Way of Life (Bodhicaryāvatāra)_, tr. Vesna A. Wallace and B. Alan Wallace (Ithaca, NY: Snow Lion, 1997), 34-5, 139-40, 144] ^2-2
###### 2-3
It's very, very powerful. Very beautiful passage. When [[Shantideva|Śāntideva]], in the _[[Bodhisattvacaryavatara|Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra]]_ (that extract's from that) where he puts these ideas forth and this aspiration forth, the chapter before that, it comes, it bursts - he describes it _bursting_ into his [[consciousness]] as a kind of explosion of this aspiration for [[compassion]], very sudden. But I wonder, you know, alongside - with the language being extremely ornate and extreme and colourful - I wonder if that's also an exaggeration, and if this aspiration towards [[compassion]] necessarily needs to take [[birth]] in a sudden way. You know, sudden equals dramatic, and people like that because it's like, "Ooh!" But I wonder if this movement towards making [[compassion]] central can actually be a gradual movement. Does it need to be sudden? Or both[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Maybe this aspiration doesn't necessarily need to take birth in a sudden way but can rather be a gradual movement|?]] ^2-3
###### 2-4
And the question I want to go into today is, what allows that kind of [[compassion]], first of all to be there, to arise, but second of all to actually stay, to stay there? [[Compassion]] like that, a huge [[compassion]], to have [[compassion]] be central in one's life, to have [[love]] and [[compassion]] be central, it needs - the [[compassion]] needs an unshakeability to it. Somehow in the [[compassion]] there needs to be a real sense of, yeah, unshakeability, that it will stand up in the face of whatever [[Dukkha|suffering]] and all [[Dukkha|suffering]]. So the bigger the [[compassion]], in a way, the bigger the unshakeability it needs, the bigger the foundation. So this is really what I want to go into today. And this is where the fourth _brahmavihāra_, [[equanimity]], comes in. How does that come into [[compassion]], to allow the [[compassion]] to be stronger and more stable[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#What allows this kind of compassion to arise and stay|?]] ^2-4
###### 2-5
So, there are these four _[[Brahmaviharas|brahmavihāras]]_: _[[Metta|mettā]]_, [[compassion]], _[[Mudita|muditā]]_ ([[Happiness|joy]], which [[Catherine McGee|Catherine]] talked about yesterday), and [[equanimity]]. And I'm sure [[Catherine McGee|Catherine]] said this, but just to say, _[[Mudita|muditā]]_ oftentimes gets translated as '[[Mudita|sympathetic joy]],' [[Happiness|joy]] in the [[Happiness|joy]] of others. But really it's something much broader than that. It's, you could say, [[Mudita|spiritual joy]], [[Happiness|joy]] that doesn't depend on the ego. So [[Happiness|joy]] that doesn't depend on me getting something, you telling me how wonderful I am, me getting anything. It's not about the ego. It's [[Happiness|joy]] that's coming from an openness, being touched in life[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Four brahmaviharas; mudita|.]] ^2-5
###### 3-1
And so, there's _[[Mudita|muditā]]_, and there's this last _brahmavihāra_, [[equanimity]], or _[[Equanimity|upekkhā]]_. Now, when the [[Buddha]] talked about [[equanimity]], most of the time he meant [[equanimity]] in relation to all things and all conditions. So it wasn't just in relationship to the [[Dukkha|suffering]] of beings. So in a way, it has two meanings. One is a very broad meaning: just stable, steady, remaining open in the face of whatever happens, whatever conditions there are, whatever conditions arise. And then the almost like 'smaller' meaning, which is actually what I want to go into more today: [[equanimity]] in its relationship to [[compassion]], the way that [[equanimity]] needs to be there at the base of [[compassion]] to make that [[compassion]] really, really unshakeable[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Equanimity in its relationship to compassion|.]] ^3-1
###### 3-2
So that, in our lives or in our practices, we give [[compassion]] to beings. Or we help beings - we work in service or whatever it is. We work to help others. And oftentimes that helps. What we do helps. It's a factor that helps. But sometimes we're wishing [[compassion]], we're meditating, we're actively involved in helping, and it doesn't help. It's just, the person is still [[Dukkha|suffering]] or getting worse. So this is really where the [[equanimity]] needs to come in[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Sometimes we help and it gets better sometimes not and that's where equanimity needs to come in|.]] ^3-2
###### 3-3
So, questions: how does that come into the practice? How do we bring that in, in a very deep way, to the [[compassion]] practice, this [[equanimity]]? This will be the last time I say this piece, on this [[retreat]] at least, if you can stand it one more time: this balance, balance in the practice that I talk about - when we talk about [[compassion]] in the [[meditation]], there's the taking in, the [[empathy]], the tuning into the [[Dukkha|suffering]] of another, letting the heart resonate, letting that sorrow resonate in the heart, the receiving of the [[Dukkha|suffering]]. And the balancing of that with the [[healing]] [[energy]] that goes out, the balm, that which soothes, that which helps. And feeling that [[energy]] on its way out, the balm, the [[healing]], because it bathes oneself on the way out, and it's actually pleasant, and it's actually happy, even if it's just quietly happy, and it's actually [[Cultivation|nourishing]][[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Recap balancing of receiving and giving|.]] ^3-3
###### 3-4
So this is really, really crucial. And as I said, the balance won't be a set point. It will be dynamic. It will be moving back and forth. But we can develop this skill where we're actually aware where the balance is at any point in time. Am I too long in the [[empathy]] side? Too long with the [[grief]] of it? Do I need to sit more in the other side, feeling the [[Cultivation|nourishment]] of it? There _will_ be [[grief]]. There will be. And it's a beautiful thing when the heart opens and there are tears at the [[Dukkha|suffering]] in the world, the huge amount of [[Dukkha|suffering]] in the world, or those that we know. And the heart resonates with that. And it's a beautiful, precious treasure of what it is to be human, to live in the fullness of our humanity, that we _will_ feel that, and we _will_ shed tears, and we _will_ feel that [[grief]][[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Develop the skill to find the dynamic balance|.]] ^3-4
###### 3-5
But unless, in a long-term way, unless we get this, take care of this balance, the [[compassion]] won't have strength and sustainability to it. And that's what we're really talking about: sustainability. What gives [[compassion]] - just that it lasts, it can really last? It's really, really important. Now, I'm talking in terms of very specific nuts and bolts of technique with this. But the beautiful thing is it _translates_. Develop the skill on the cushion, in the [[meditation]] hall, of this balance, and it translates when you're sitting opposite someone, listening to them. You're holding their hand. You're with someone. You can actually take that same skill that came from the [[Meditation|meditation practice]] and translate it into the personal, when you're talking, when you're listening, etc. It's just a skill. But this is really, really fundamental, and it gives the [[compassion]] a sense of [[Happiness|buoyancy]]. So as I said, how common it is for people to do the [[compassion]] practice and then just feel sunk under it, _burdened_ by [[compassion]]. Often doesn't take very long. Come on a [[retreat]] like this, a couple of days, and it's like, "_Phew_! Can we move on to the next one?" So it gives it a [[Happiness|buoyancy]], a balance, a [[steadiness]], and this unshakeable quality, all of which are factors of [[equanimity]] coming in[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#You can take the skill from the cushion into the personal life|.]] ^3-5
###### 4-1
And then - again, also to repeat something else I've said a few times - the _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_. So I'm just harping on and on about _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_. In its most fundamental sense, _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ as non-distractedness - or _less_ distractedness, put it that way - because, again, please remember it's a continuum, _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_. And I can't remember if I said this the other day, but there's such a tendency to think, "Oh, I have it," "I don't have it, and if I don't have it, then I'm a failure," and [[the self]]-judge comes in. It's a continuum. But generally speaking, _less_ distractedness - there's actually more [[steadiness]] in the [[mind]]. You can actually see that. So it's a simple equation: less distractedness, more [[steadiness]]. And that [[steadiness]] begins to absorb into the being in all kinds of ways. So not to neglect the power of the _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Samadhi as less distractedness is more steadiness in the mind|.]] ^4-1
###### 4-2
And it's very common for people to say to me, "Well, it's better for me to practise where there are more disturbances and my _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ is actually worse, because that's more similar to what I live with outside. And therefore it will have a greater carry-over effect when I leave the [[retreat]]." Now, there's a certain amount of [[Insight|wisdom]] in that, but don't neglect how much the _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ can actually come into the being and affect the cells and the whole [[consciousness]] that way[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Don't neglect how much samadhi can come into the being and affect the cells|.]] ^4-2
###### 4-3
**Yogi**: How does it affect the cells? ^4-3
###### 4-4
**Rob**: Because _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ is a very - there's a big _physical_ sense in _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_. As you go deeper into _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_, the [[Embodiment|body]] sense is more and more involved, and the [[Embodiment|sense of the body]]. And there's a sense that the [[Embodiment|body]] is being more and more steeped or bathed in something that's very, very [[Cultivation|nourishing]] and ultimately very, very still. And that literally becomes the more common way that the [[Embodiment|body]] feels in life. That openness, that lightness, that sense of strength and [[steadiness]] comes into the [[Embodiment|body]], and then that sense is with you more and more of the time[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The body is steeped in something very nourishing and still a sense which is with you more and more|.]] ^4-4
###### 4-5
**Yogi**: You say it heals. How does it heal differently from [[compassion]]? Same? ^4-5
###### 4-6
**Rob**: Slightly differently, but there's also a relationship there. We can come back to it at the end if you want. ^4-6
###### 4-7
We didn't really go much into _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ on this [[retreat]], but just to say, there could be another [[retreat]] where we spent a month just on _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_, or three months, or whatever it is. And as the _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ deepens, it actually brings with it [[Happiness|joy]]. It goes through a whole range of territory where [[Happiness|joy]] comes, and [[Happiness|joy]] comes very fully into the being. And that [[Happiness|joy]], the _[[Mudita|muditā]]_, is also a basis for [[equanimity]]. When we have [[Happiness|joy]], when we're familiar and have familiar access with a sense of [[Happiness|joy]] in our life, we have enough. And then we're less shakeable in this life and in relationship to our [[Dukkha|suffering]] and the [[Dukkha|suffering]] of others. So the _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ naturally actually goes on a journey, long-term I'm talking about, naturally goes on a journey through [[Happiness|joy]] and then naturally actually ripens into [[equanimity]][[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#As the samadhi deepens it brings with it joy|.]] ^4-7
###### 5-1
When we're doing the [[compassion]] practice, it's very common and very normal to have a sense of [[the self]] doing the [[compassion]]: here I am, sitting and walking and kind of flapping as much as I can and trying to generate some [[compassion]]. And that's very normal. It's very natural. [[The self]] is doing the [[compassion]]. And sometimes, _sometimes_ - and I'm sure some of you have tasted this to some degree or other - again, as the practice deepens, as the _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ deepens, there can be a sense that it's less [[the self]] doing it. There's just a sense of almost effortlessness, or less effort, less self behind it and more just [[compassion]] _present_. There seems to be less _doing_. Now, it can be common, if one gets a taste of that at times, to neglect kind of the doing of the [[compassion]] and to think, "Well, the really proper [[compassion]] is when I don't feel like I'm doing it, or when it doesn't feel to be much self in it." But the whole range is important. And this is really, really important to keep in [[mind]]. The whole range of [[compassion]] and how [[compassion]] feels is important to us[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The whole range of feeling compassion is important|.]] ^5-1
###### 5-2
So sometimes, it _does_ feel like, "Here I am, flapping and huffing and puffing and trying to get the [[compassion]] going." There's very much the _self_, _this self_ giving [[compassion]] to _that self -_ very much about self and other, absolutely necessary and fine, and important. So this doing _is_ an aspect of [[compassion]]. [[Compassion]] wants to alleviate [[Dukkha|suffering]], and there's a doing in that. There are also the other aspects of [[compassion]], receiving and holding [[Dukkha|suffering]], definitely. But there's also a doing involved. So, you know, if we are in the presence of a child that's starving, we don't say, you know, "I'm feeling really receptive. Tell me all about it. I'm all ears." [laughter] Silly, obviously. You _do_ something. You _act_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Doing is an aspect of compassion|.]] ^5-2
###### 5-3
But this is delicate. Sometimes when we do more, or _feel_ we're doing more, actually, in the doing, the [[The Self|sense of self]] gets built up because it becomes the doer. [[The self]] becomes the doer, and with it, a sense of attachment to results. The more doing - not always, but oftentimes - the more doing, the more self and the more attachment to the results. And with that attachment to the results, the less [[equanimity]] in the [[compassion]]. Do you see that[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Sometimes with more doing there is more self and more attachment to the results|?]] ^5-3
###### 5-4
I remember, five years ago or something, being [[Retreat|on retreat]] here for three months and at some point getting ill (I can't remember when it was) at some point in the [[retreat]]. And getting ill with a flare-up of Crohn's disease, which is something I suffer from, from time to time. And this is a disease - some of you may know - where they haven't really figured out a cause for it. They don't really understand it. And so, my particular personality, what happens to _me_ when I get it is one part of my being tries to figure it out. And I start experimenting with diet and this alternative and that, and sort of taking notes, and ... [laughs] And I just, you know, it's just my personality. I can't help it. Well, I probably could. But anyway ... [laughter] What I noticed at that time was there were two modes: ^5-4
###### 5-5
**(1)** One, I was [[Retreat|on retreat]], which is a very 'nothing to do, nowhere to go' mode. And I could just sit with the discomfort of it and the [[pain]] of it and the [[fear]], etc., and just hold all that in [[compassion]] and non-doing - just being with that, just letting that be held. And that was one mode, which was a very beautiful way of being with something very difficult[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#1 mode just being with that|.]] ^5-5
###### 5-6
**(2)** And then another mode was very much about doing and trying to take care of myself and trying to figure out what the best thing - what would bring [[healing]][[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#2 mode trying to figure out what would bring healing|.]] ^5-6
###### 5-7
_Both_ are necessary. Just to watch - sometimes, what I noticed was the more that I got into the 'figuring out' mode, out of wanting to heal, oftentimes it felt the more removed I was from the kind of holding of the [[compassion]] and the sense of that, the sweetness of [[compassion]], in a way[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Both modes are necessary|.]] ^5-7
###### 6-1
_Both_ are necessary though. It's really important to acknowledge that with [[compassion]], it really is a range, and _all_ of that is [[compassion]]. Even when it looks like one is just tearing one's hair out trying to figure something out or trying to help someone, it's still the expression of [[compassion]] - very much so[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Acknowledge that with compassion there is a range|.]] ^6-1
###### 6-2
Sometimes, as has been mentioned, the [[compassion]] practice can seem, at times, for some people, can seem as if it opens out or drops into a whole other sense. There really is a spectrum here. And it's almost like a space of [[compassion]] opens up, a space. And in that space, [[Dukkha|suffering]] is held, that whatever [[Dukkha|suffering]] arises is held in that space. It's a space of [[compassion]]. And it could feel like it's a space within us, or it could feel like it's a vast space (and we've touched on this before in this [[retreat]]), a space that's actually the size of the universe. It's infinite[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#A space of compassion|.]] ^6-2
###### 6-3
This is a very real [[perception]] that can arise for different people at different times. [[Spaciousness]] is also a quality, an _aspect_ of [[equanimity]] - very much so. When there's [[Dukkha|suffering]], a [[spaciousness]] around that [[Dukkha|suffering]] is a colour, a face, of [[equanimity]]. In this practice, the more that we can actually encourage and dwell in that [[spaciousness]], where whatever [[Dukkha|suffering]] there is or whatever [[Dukkha|suffering]] could possibly arise in the universe, it actually is effortlessly held. And we can begin to get glimpses of that [[experience]] and then actually [[Cultivation|nurture]] it. We can learn to [[Cultivation|nurture]] that [[experience]] as a very real [[perception]] that begins, again, in a very real way, to change our whole relationship with [[Dukkha|suffering]] in the world and in ourselves and in this life. That it moves more and more from 'little old me' who has to hold this [[Dukkha|suffering]] to a kind of - it's just held, and one knows it's held, and one feels it's held. And in that vastness of holding, there's [[equanimity]] with the [[compassion]], mixed in with the [[compassion]][[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The more we encourage this spaciousness the more suffering can be effortlessly held in it|.]] ^6-3
###### 6-4
And sometimes, for some people, this can be a very - well, almost always is a very beautiful sense, even a mystical or a religious sense, and that's very much a part of it. The [[Perception|perceptions]] can change. They can open out. And something very beautiful is born there which we can then ... not _snatch_ at and not try to _keep_, but encourage, [[Cultivation|nurture]], [[Cultivation|nourish]] that opening of the [[perception]]. And it's a gradual thing, but it's definitely possible. A lot of transformation comes from that[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#This can be very beautiful even mystical|.]] ^6-4
###### 6-5
Someone wrote me a little note with a poem that she'd found from Rilke.^[Rainer Maria Rilke, "Autumn," tr. Jonathan Cott. Archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20201102174022/http://www.monadnockmama.com/poem-for-an-autumn-day] It's very lovely. It speaks to this sense of the holding being something almost religious, or simply religious[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Rainer Maria Rilke "Autumn"|.]] ^6-5
###### 6-6
(25:39 - 26:18, poem) ^6-6
###### 6-7
Very beautiful, speaking about this holding, which for some people takes a very personal flavour. And in [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan traditions]] and other of the Buddhist traditions, very much the relationship with the [[bodhisattva]], the relationship with the guru or the root guru, as someone one prays to, as someone who's actually holding, in the vastness of their [[consciousness]], one's own [[Dukkha|suffering]]. And you get the same thing in mystical [[Christianity]], that the [[Jesus|cosmic Christ]] or the [[energy]] of Christ is actually holding the [[Dukkha|suffering]] in the universe. That could be personal, but it could also be impersonal - don't need to necessarily introduce any figure into it. And people are different, and they have different [[Habit|tendencies]]. This is a tendency that can open. It brings a lot of [[equanimity]]. One possibility[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#This can take on a very personal flavour|.]] ^6-7
###### 6-8
When we speak, when we use the language of '[[bodhisattva]],' and especially when we hear [[Shantideva|Śāntideva]] and this kind of thing, it's an incredibly high aspiration. I mean, it's almost like [[mind]]-blowingly high, _almost_ unreal. When we hear it, it's almost - I mean, that's the flavour that comes off, is a kind of [[mind]]-boggling unreality to it. And yet there are people who take it on. It comes to become something real for them. It translates in a way that becomes something real. But whether we're moved by that or repelled by that, that's actually not what I want to so much dwell on. I want to go into, what allows _our_ [[compassion]] - wherever we are in that - to become unshakeable, or more and more unshakeable[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The aspiration of a bodhisattva is mind-blowingly high|?]] ^6-8
###### 7-1
So we can have a sense of '[[bodhisattva]]' being a very high aspiration. We also need to respect: "Where are we? Where am I in all this? How is it for me right now, when I'm in a situation with someone that's [[Dukkha|suffering]], someone I know or don't know or I care about? Where am I _really_ in my humanity?" And sometimes - you know, this is really something, I think, to give very careful [[attention]] to in our life - sometimes we neglect ourselves and our needs. Sometimes we're _too_ cautious perhaps. And perhaps there _is_ a place for stretching ourselves, stretching our limits, just saying, "To [[hell]] with myself and my self-concern," and just a kind of abandon. Maybe that has its place. Or rather, it definitely has its place, but it needs to be approached with [[Insight|wisdom]]. And stretching the limits of one's stamina and one's endurance in serving and in giving - there is the place for that. And I'm not necessarily talking about something, you know, like literally giving up one's life. I'm just talking about little ways. Just [[letting go]] of [[the self]]-concern. Sometimes - and you must have come across this - you're doing the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ or the [[compassion]] practice, and something's not feeling quite right for _you_. Either the [[Embodiment|body]]'s niggling, or something's not right. It can be very skilful to just drop in, "It doesn't matter how I feel right now. It doesn't matter. I'm just giving the [[compassion]] to you." You can just play with this kind of abandonment of self-concern - not all the time, but just sometimes[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#We have to respect where we are in our humanity|.]] ^7-1
###### 7-2
But this is a very delicate area and needs a lot of careful [[attention]]. Sometimes we need to ask, "What are my needs, what are _my_ needs, in this situation? What are my [[Desire|desires]] too?" I'm sure many of you have had a situation, or have situations, where we are in a relationship or a friendship or a situation with someone where they are [[Dukkha|suffering]]. The other is [[Dukkha|suffering]]. And perhaps it's going on for quite a while. It's chronic. And we are in a caretaking role in some form or another. So maybe it's just a friendship. And sometimes, even in a friendship or relationship with a person who is bringing [[Dukkha|suffering]] on themselves, and you can see that because of the choices they're making towards, whatever it is, alcohol, drugs, the way they're living - you can just see, and yet you care about this person, and you want to live with [[compassion]] there. And one can very understandably, very naturally feel in that situation, "Here, in the ongoingness of this relationship, my needs are not being met.[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#It can happen that we feel that our needs are not being met|"]] ^7-2
###### 7-3
And so this is, I think, very common when one finds oneself in this situation with a friend or any kind of relationship where this is going on in. And especially difficult when the person seems to be bringing it on for themselves, if you've ever been close with an addict or something like that. It's a very difficult relationship to keep and keep healthy. And the question, am I taking care of my needs in this situation? Am I taking care of my needs? Not easy. Because there will be in that - if there's friendship, and if there's a [[history]] of friendship and relationship - there will be loneliness that comes in. Sometimes it can feel like the person is just not available. Either they literally don't have the [[energy]] to be there, or they're just checked out. And there can be loneliness come in. We don't feel met. We don't feel seen. We don't feel like there's a flow of [[love]] and friendship there. We don't feel loved[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#It's especially difficult if the person is bringing the suffering on for themselves|.]] ^7-3
###### 7-4
So this is all really important stuff to be aware of. What are my needs? What's going on here? And what's it important to take care of? And it can also be complicated by other factors. Sometimes we're with someone who's [[Dukkha|suffering]], and we actually, if we're honest, we look inside, we notice, or we may notice, we want to be needed. We want to be needed. And so, in a way, this is a very weird one. Something in us actually has an investment in keeping the other [[Dukkha|suffering]] because - and this is a horrible word, but in some psychotherapies they call it 'co-dependency.' It's actually a mutual investment in someone [[Dukkha|suffering]] and the other person kind of wanting to keep them down[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Codependency|.]] ^7-4
###### 8-1
We have to ask, "Do I want to feel needed? Do I need to feel needed? What's going on there if I do? Do I want to be recognized for my efforts, for the efforts of service and care?" So these are not easy questions. And in a way, some of that is just human. When we give service, when we give, when we're compassionate, there is a part of us, a very natural human part that wants to be - wants our efforts to be recognized. So the question is, or a question is, is it possible to get what we need in a healthy way - in a _healthy_ way, that it's not coming into the relationship in an undercurrent, undercover way, that we're actually conscious and getting what we need in a healthy way? Not easy, not easy territory at all[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Is it possible to get what we need in a healthy way|.]] ^8-1
###### 8-2
And sometimes when there's [[compassion]] and [[love]] and a situation of service to someone, and we feel frustrated, and we feel it's difficult, and we feel [[aversion]] is creeping in, and we feel judgment is creeping in - especially if they are not handling it well, or causing it for themselves, making wrong choices - again, [[compassion]], _[[Metta|mettā]]_ to oneself, not to neglect that. It can be so quick to rush in to give to the other[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Do not neglect metta to oneself|.]] ^8-2
###### 8-3
Oftentimes, though, we don't have that same kind of self-interest. It's not a friend or a relative or a partner or whatever that we're working with. There isn't that self-interest. But still the question, what is it that allows, that helps, the [[compassion]] to stay strong, to stay steady, to stay tender? So when I say 'strength,' I really mean to stay open, that the heart stays open, and stays soft and tender. What allows that? Often in the world we do see - it's clear. We look at another, and we can see. We look at others, and we see they are, you could say - one way of putting it is they're causing [[Dukkha|suffering]] for themselves or others, and out of [[ignorance]]. They're just not seeing the consequences of their actions or their way of being. And it's clear, and we look and we see that. And this is partly why [[equanimity]] is - why I want to speak about it. It's so important. The [[equanimity]] needs to come in[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#What is it that helps the compassion to stay strong|.]] ^8-3
###### 8-4
Remember we talked about [[Near enemy|near enemies]]? And [[Near enemy|near enemies]] of [[Metta|loving-kindness]] and [[Near enemy|near enemies]] of [[compassion]]. A [[near enemy]] of [[equanimity]] - something that _looks_ like it but on closer inspection is really _not_ it - the [[near enemy]] of [[equanimity]] is indifference. It's just, the heart's actually shut down, cold, disinterested, disconnected, whereas [[equanimity]] is actually open. It's still tender. It's still soft. It's interested. It's present. So oftentimes, indifference can even be dressed up in spiritual language. But it's not [[equanimity]]. Spiritual language in different traditions, you know, we have the notion of [[karma]]. And how often people - the temptation is to hear, "They're [[Dukkha|suffering]]" - the attitude - "It's just their [[karma]]. It's their [[karma]], and they need to go through it." That's an Eastern concept. Or in the West, it's, you know, "God's punishing them," or something. These are taking spiritual concepts and using them in immature [[Insight|understandings]]. Rather to ask, "What is my responsibility to [[Dukkha|suffering]], with [[Dukkha|suffering]]?" This is a huge question: "What's my responsibility? What's my response-ability, my ability to respond? What is my response?[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The near enemy of equanimity is indifference sometimes couched in spiritual language|"]] ^8-4
###### 8-5
So [[compassion]], and particularly [[compassion]] with [[equanimity]] in it, has two factors which I want to say a bit about and talk around for a little bit. [[Compassion]] needs to have [[Insight|wisdom]] in it, and it needs to have [[Devotion|faith]] in it. I want to talk around this for a little bit; it needs to have [[Insight|wisdom]] and [[Devotion|faith]]. And this is at all kinds of different levels. So at a very sort of, I don't know, is it mundane level, perhaps, one aspect of [[Insight|wisdom]] is just realizing the limits of our actions. So very easy to see this in the context of a political context, the limits, even in a democracy. You know, the tendency is to think, "What difference does it make if I vote or not?" Or certainly to see it very clearly with globalization. To realize the actual limits of one's actions and just to see: we are limited. Or even in other contexts, you have to see that here, one may be giving service or acting compassionately or trying to alleviate the [[Dukkha|suffering]], and it's only one strand in a [[Dependent Origination|web of conditions]]. So what we do, what we choose to do, how we act and speak is just one strand in a [[Dependent Origination|web of conditions]], in a web of interdependence[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Compassion needs wisdom and faith in it|.]] ^8-5
###### 9-1
For example, I mean, it's interesting giving talks, for many reasons. But one gives a talk, and one wants to help. One wants to offer something to help. And it's important, you know, for me to reflect, and I think for everyone who's doing this kind of thing, or any kind of act, to reflect that one gives a talk - there's so much going on. Like right now, there's so much going on making up this talk. It may seem to me or to you that _I'm_ giving the talk. Now, of course, at one level, I am. But actually, and if anyone has ever been involved in any kind of performing art, what you become aware of is, the talk is actually a collaboration. I'm actually doing most of the talking. [laughter] Although this group's interesting! [laughter] But anyway, it's actually a collaboration. So I still have this piece of paper and the notes and what I want to get through in the course of the talk. But there's something in the way everyone is present or not present, wakeful or not wakeful, interested or not, _everything_ - you know, if you ate too much for lunch, that's going to affect this talk. Thank you very much. [laughter] It's a totally collaborative effort. So what comes out of the mouth, the whole [[energy]], the whole feel of it is actually a [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]]. It's a [[Dependent Origination|web of conditions]][[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Example giving a talk|.]] ^9-1
###### 9-2
If I, in wanting to serve, in wanting to give something, am too much seeing it from [[the self]] - there's just one strand there. It's just one strand. And then the words come out, and _some_ of them are heard - let's be honest - _some_ of them are heard and some not. And its effects also, a whole - where's it landing? It's landing in a lot of different [[Mind state|mind states]]. It's landing in a lot of different practice histories. It's landing in a lot of different life situations. And one will leave this talk, this [[retreat]], and go out and meet a whole set of other conditions. So a talk, or a [[Dharma|Dharma teaching]], or whatever it is, an [[insight]], is actually just a seed. And then it needs to meet a lot of other conditions. Now if I, in willing [[compassion]], in giving, see myself as _too_ much of an instrument, or _too_ significant of an instrument, that's where my [[compassion]] is going to get too wobbly. It's not going to have that unshakeability to it. Have to see the web here, in this moment, and certainly in the future[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The talk is landing in a lot of different mind states|.]] ^9-2
###### 9-3
So, you know, we talked about [[emptiness]] the other night - _very_ hard to understand subject, very difficult subject to understand just intellectually, and then to really absorb that [[Insight|understanding]]. For me, it's much more helpful to see something like that, a talk like that - "It's just a seed. It's just a seed." And then perhaps it will meet other seeds, and there will be growing. But if I think, "Right, by starting the talk at 7:30, by 8:30, everyone in this room needs to ..." [laughs] It's too much! Beings that we are helping, we need to remember, after this interaction, after this giving of the [[compassion]], they go on, and they meet, they will meet, other conditions and other influences. I am not the sole provider of conditions and [[compassion]][[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The talk is just a seed|.]] ^9-3
###### 9-4
There are a few very interesting passages from the [[Sutta|suttas]], from the [[Buddha]]. I'm not quite sure where to put them in. I'll put them in here, in terms of conditions. He's talking about [[karma]], and he's talking about the ripening of [[karma]] from the past. So this could be, we've done something that we regret, and then we feel the [[pain]] of that regret, that remorse or guilt. Or it could be that something bad has happened to us, and we have that memory. Something from the past is having its effect in the present: [[karma]]. He says something very interesting in a few different passages. When the [[mind]], when the heart, is small, restricted, that [[karma]] ripens - the memory of what we did, or what happened to us or whatever - ripens in that context of the restricted, the constricted heart. In the unrestricted heart, the [[Immeasurability|immeasurable]] heart - so one that is either [[Immeasurability|immeasurable]] through [[Metta|loving-kindness]] and [[compassion]], or [[Happiness|joy]] or [[equanimity]], one of the _[[Brahmaviharas|brahmavihāras]]_, [[Immeasurability|immeasurable]] that way, or unrestricted through _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ or through [[insight]] - in the unrestricted heart, when that [[karma]] ripens, when it comes up, when the memory comes up or the effects from the past come up, memory or otherwise, it's in a very different context. And the [[Buddha]] said it will barely be noticed. The [[pain]] from the past, the [[karma]] from the past will barely be noticed when the heart is really, really open like that. So this is a very powerful, very striking and powerful teaching[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Ripening of karma from the past|.]] ^9-4
###### 10-1
**Yogi 2**: Is that a continuum then, Rob? So you're kind of saying, the more constricted the heart, the smaller the space in the [[mind]], the bigger the [[karma]] will be, the wider? ^10-1
###### 10-2
**Rob**: Absolutely, very much, yeah. So it's a real - all this that I'm talking about is a continuum. Yeah, very important. So the smaller the heart, at any time, the [[karma]] comes up - extremely massive effect. The [[Buddha]] gives a few analogies - one of them is a salt crystal in a cup of water. How does the water taste after that? Pretty salty. Salt crystal in a huge lake, barely noticeable. And the [[Buddha]] says it will come up, but barely noticeable, barely making an impression when the heart is really ... So even when beings are [[Dukkha|suffering]], there is the condition that they meet of what the heart is at any time in the future. Another analogy he gives is - and this just says something about the sort of judicial system of his time, but also at this time in different countries - that if you're a poor man, you can be thrown in jail for a long, long time, and no one cares, and you just get stuck in jail. But if you're a wealthy man, it doesn't happen. You don't get stuck in jail for a long time. You don't get thrown in jail. Not a very nice analogy, but the riches of the - again, what we're nurturing inside and the openness of the heart, the [[cultivation]] of this as a real wealth, _real_ wealth.^[The Buddha's words about the unrestricted, immeasurable heart, together with his analogies of the salt crystal and the poor man thrown in jail, are found at AN 3:101, _Loṇaphala Sutta_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Similes salt in a lake; no jail for wealthy man|]]] ^10-2
###### 10-3
So [[compassion]] has, as I said, [[Insight|wisdom]] and [[Devotion|faith]] in it. [[Compassion]] has [[Devotion|faith]] in it, and I want to go into this a little bit, what this might mean. This [[Devotion|faith]] gives [[equanimity]] to the [[compassion]]. Has anyone heard of [[Maximilian Kolbe]]? I just remembered his story the other day because I remembered telling you about my trip to Auschwitz. And when I was there, I came across the story of [[Maximilian Kolbe]] - hope I remember it. He was a Polish man who became a Franciscan priest and monk ('Franciscan' is a denomination of Catholic monk and priest), I think in his early twenties, and lived in Poland and some time in Asia. And then the Nazis overtook Poland, and he was thrown in jail immediately just as a suspect, because of being a monk and a Catholic. And then released[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Story Maximilian Kolbe|.]] ^10-3
###### 10-4
He went back to his friary and hid - some way or another - hid 3,000 Polish refugees there, 2,000 of whom were Jewish. And he hid them there, obviously under great danger to himself, great threat to himself. After a while, it was found out, and he and some of his colleagues were sent to Auschwitz, in the early part of the camp's existence. And after he'd been there a few months, just a couple of months, one day in his block, in his cell block, a prisoner went missing. And so the assumption on behalf of the Nazi guards was that this prisoner had escaped. It actually turned out that he had drowned in a latrine either by suicide or accident. But anyway, the assumption was that he had escaped, and the punishment if a person escaped from a cell block was that ten men were chosen at random and executed from that cell block. And so, ten were chosen from his block, and one of them, one of these ten, on being chosen - he was actually a Polish resistance fighter who was in Auschwitz. There were a lot of political prisoners in Auschwitz at the time. And one of them immediately broke down. He was picked as one of the ten. He immediately broke down: "How are my wife and children going to get on without me? You know, I've got young children. I've got a wife." And he immediately broke down. Didn't make any impact[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Punishment for escaped prisoner|.]] ^10-4
###### 11-1
But then Father Kolbe, [[Maximilian Kolbe]], stepped forward, and he said, "I will take the place of this man." And miraculously the commandant, the Nazi commandant, actually agreed to let this happen. So the punishment - this isn't very nice to hear, but the punishment was that they were thrown into a little room. I've actually seen the room. It's a tiny room, I thought. It was so tiny, I thought they must have died from asphyxiation, but actually they were left there to starve. And so just thrown into this little room at the bottom of the stairs and left there to starve. And usually people would last a few days before, basically, the [[Embodiment|body]] starts to decompose. After two weeks, the camp authorities needed to put more victims in the room, basically, so they went down to clear it out and found four of them still alive. Three of them were not conscious but still alive, and there was the last one still alive, which was actually Father Kolbe. And they killed - well, the camp executioner killed them with lethal injection. That's how they killed them. And he was completely conscious at the time of his [[death]][[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#"I will take the place of this man" to starve to death|.]] ^11-1
###### 11-2
So, not a very nice story to hear. But one [[Wonder|wonders]], hearing - so what's going on? What was going on for him? And you know, that's just one story. One could pick out countless [[stories]] in the [[history]] of humanity where that kind of level of self-renunciation, self-abandonment is going on in the service of others. What's going on? There's another lovely ... Do you know who [[Damien the Leper]] is? Have you heard that? Just briefly, he was also actually a Catholic monk in the Dominican order. At one time, one of the Hawaiian Islands was a leper colony. So they would just use it to keep lepers. No one else lived there but lepers because of the [[fear]] of contagion. And he volunteered to be a minister to the lepers, to go and live out the rest of his life on this island with nothing but thousands and thousands of lepers. And he volunteered to do that. And he was a doctor, and he ministered to them, and he also was their religious minister. Eventually, I think it took twelve years, but he eventually [[Contraction|contracted]] leprosy and eventually died[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Story Damien the Leper|.]] ^11-2
###### 11-3
And you think, what's going on? [[Compassion]] has [[Devotion|faith]] in it. I'm just picking those, I mean, random. What's going on in a being's [[consciousness]] that allows something like that? So we talk about [[Devotion|faith]], and we could talk a long time about [[Devotion|faith]]. [[Devotion|Faith]] is a very interesting quality. And again, there's a real spectrum to [[Devotion|faith]]. So the beginnings of [[Devotion|faith]], and particularly if we talk about - we haven't talked much on this [[retreat]] about a sort of devotional [[Devotion|faith]], and too much about relationship with [[Avalokiteshvara|Kuan Yin]] and that kind of thing. Immature [[Devotion|faith]], or the beginnings of [[Devotion|faith]], the [[Devotion|faith]] that "It will turn out how I want" - or we hear, "It will be all right," but what that really translates as, "It will turn out how I want." And that's the beginnings of [[Devotion|faith]], but it's actually an immature [[Devotion|faith]][[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Beginnings of faith|.]] ^11-3
###### 11-4
A path of [[Devotion|faith]] and [[devotion]] - and this is a real path for people who tread it - it actually deepens. It deepens, and it matures. And there's a maturing of what [[devotion]] means and what [[Devotion|faith]] means. And so it moves - it leaves behind 'what I can get,' 'what can I get,' 'what I am asking you for' - I am asking God or [[bodhisattva]] or Christ or whatever it is, what I'm asking for - it moves away from that. And someone said, not on this [[retreat]], but just a week or so ago, I was meeting with them, and she said to me, "It feels like the gods have abandoned me." And we explored it, and what she really meant was "I'm not getting what I want.[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#There is a maturing what devotion and what faith means|"]] ^11-4
###### 12-1
It transforms, and it deepens, and you know, the beautiful words of [[Jesus]] in the Garden of Gethsemane - he knows what's coming, and he says, "Thy will be done."^[Matthew 26:42] _Thy_ will, not mine, be done. As I said there's, again, this turning upside down of values, turning inside out: _thy_ will, not mine, be done. And so powerful and so beautiful. There's this movement into - as much as there's a movement of a path of [[Insight|wisdom]] into depth, there's a movement of path of [[devotion]] into depths. And people write about this. [[St John of the Cross]] is perhaps one of the most famous ones. Moving away from the kind of sense of consolation one gets from God or [[bodhisattva]] or whatever it is, away from that to _thy will_, and actually into the dark night of the [[soul]], where one feels one isn't getting anything. There's something in that darkness, in that not getting[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane|.]] ^12-1
###### 12-2
So it deepens, but I think, when I reflect on what must have been going on - we don't know what was going on with Father Kolbe. What must have been going on? Something happens in the deepening of [[Devotion|faith]] and [[devotion]]. And this is what's perhaps important: the view of [[Dukkha|suffering]] changes. The view that we have of [[Dukkha|suffering]] changes. And in this case, it was through [[Devotion|faith]]. So you can be - _I_ feel pretty sure that Father Kolbe was seeing that situation differently. There was something in the depth of his [[Devotion|faith]] and [[devotion]] and sense of, in this case, sense of God, or whatever you want to call it, something that allowed him to see that situation differently, so that the [[Dukkha|suffering]] is not the whole of reality. This is very interesting. Or that [[Dukkha|suffering]] is not as real as it seems. Or that the [[Dukkha|suffering]], again, is held in something else. It's held in something else. All of these are different views of [[Dukkha|suffering]]. They're different ways that the [[Dukkha|suffering]] is seen and related to[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The view of suffering changes|.]] ^12-2
###### 12-3
If we talk more in line with sort of typical Buddhist practice, more [[Theravada|Theravāda]] and that sort of - more what we're familiar with, and we say, "What is [[Dharma]] [[Devotion|faith]]? What does [[Dharma]] [[Devotion|faith]] mean? What does it mean for us to have [[Devotion|faith]] and bring that [[Devotion|faith]] into [[compassion]]?" Again, this is something we could talk so much about. There are perhaps two qualities that are really crucial, two aspects[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Two aspects of Dharma faith|.]] ^12-3
###### 12-4
**(1)** One is, the first aspect, I think, of [[Devotion|faith]] is that beautiful - it's also an [[insight]] - beautiful qualities, cultivating beautiful qualities, cultivating this openness of heart and everything that brings that ([[generosity]] and [[equanimity]], and _[[Samadhi|samādhi]]_ and _[[Metta|mettā]]_ and [[love]], all those qualities), **[[cultivation]] of beautiful qualities brings [[Pleasantness|well-being]] and [[happiness]] and security**. That's what brings - I think I said this in another talk - that's what brings security in life. There's a [[Insight|wisdom]] in seeing that, and there's a [[Devotion|faith]] in it - [[Devotion|faith]] in that, and also [[Devotion|faith]] that it's possible for me. It's possible for me to [[Cultivation|cultivate]] - wherever I am now, whatever lack of beautiful qualities I seem to have when I look inside, however impoverished I feel - it's possible for me, it's possible for this being, this heart, this [[mind]], to [[Cultivation|cultivate]] beautiful qualities and grow, let them grow. The first aspect of [[Devotion|faith]][[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#1 Cultivation of beautiful qualities brings well-being and happiness and security|.]] ^12-4
###### 12-5
**(2)** The second aspect of [[Devotion|faith]], in a more [[Dharma]] sense, strictly [[Dharma]] or _conventional_ [[Dharma]] sense, is that **[[Freedom|freedom from suffering]] is possible**. This is at the root of any kind of [[Dharma]] [[Insight|understanding]]. But it's interesting, because different [[Dharma]] scenes are different, and this is a particular one, sort of typical [[Gaia House]] scene. But one could say, "[[Freedom|Freedom from suffering]] is possible _generally_." In other words, it is possible, [[awakening]] is possible, [[Freedom|freedom from suffering]] is possible in a very general, complete sense. And it's interesting how many practitioners and even long-term practitioners believe that. And I know people who have been practising decades and actually don't believe in the possibility of [[awakening]] or [[Awakening|enlightenment]]. I'm not going to get into that now[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#2 Freedom from suffering is possible|.]] ^12-5
###### 13-1
What's more important, I think, is also, in the moment, [[Freedom|freedom from suffering]] is possible. Or it's possible to, at least in this instance, whatever it is, whatever's going on, less [[Dukkha|suffering]] is possible. A degree of [[freedom]] of [[Dukkha|suffering]] is possible. That's a real [[Devotion|faith]]. That's a [[Insight|wisdom]] as well. And that's active. It does something. It means, here I am in a situation of [[Dukkha|suffering]], and I know, I have [[Devotion|faith]] that it's possible for me to suffer less, or another to suffer less[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Whatever is going on less suffering is possible|.]] ^13-1
###### 13-2
in And what that [[Devotion|faith]], kind of with [[Insight|wisdom]] in it, what it does is it brings an aliveness into the relationship with the [[Dukkha|suffering]]. It brings an aliveness, an openness, an inquiry, a responsiveness. And this is really, really - in a way, it's such a small shift, but it's so significant. It's what transforms a moment of [[Dukkha|suffering]] into a moment of potential and practice. Otherwise, how are we viewing [[Dukkha|suffering]]? If none of this [[Devotion|faith]] and [[Insight|wisdom]] is there, how are we actually viewing [[Dukkha|suffering]], our own and others'? I think nowadays that we live in a non-religious culture, a very secular culture. How easy it is, without us even realizing it, to view [[Dukkha|suffering]] as meaningless, and in that, to be actually overwhelmed with [[Dukkha|suffering]]. Again, how are we seeing it? What's giving the view and the context to the [[Dukkha|suffering]] that we see? Very easy in the [[Dominant culture|modern culture]] to view [[Dukkha|suffering]] as meaningless, pointless, nothing can come from it[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Very easy in the modern culture to see suffering as meaningless|.]] ^13-2
###### 13-3
So [[compassion]] has [[Insight|wisdom]] in it. And fundamentally, what that means is that we begin more and more, or more and more deeply, to understand the [[Dependent Origination|causes and conditions]] that give rise to [[Dukkha|suffering]]. That's what [[Insight|wisdom]] or [[insight]] or _paññā_ means: we're [[Insight|understanding]] the [[Dependent Origination|causes and conditions]] that lead to [[Dukkha|suffering]]. And out of that very [[Insight|understanding]] is born [[compassion]]. That very [[Insight|understanding]] will bring with it [[compassion]]. So one could never go anywhere near [[Metta|loving-kindness]] practice or [[compassion]] practice, and just the deepening of the [[insight]] will bring [[compassion]] naturally, effortlessly, organically, because we're going into the [[Dependent Origination|causes and conditions]] and _[[Insight|understanding]]_ that[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Compassion is borne out of the understanding of the causes and conditions of suffering|.]] ^13-3
###### 13-4
**Yogi 3**: But Rob, when you say it's meaningless do you mean that - what is the meaning? The meaning is - the meaning of [[Dukkha|suffering]] is to be awakened from it? ^13-4
###### 13-5
**Rob**: Yeah, perhaps that's not the best word. Rather that it's not just a random thing that one has to just - either it doesn't have a meaning, or one just has to put up with, and one doesn't understand, and it's just there. So in the [[Dharma]], in the strictly [[Dharma]] [[Devotion|sense of faith]], it's like, "I can understand something here that transforms it." So, just saying, it becomes a field of potential and a moment of potential. And other ways would be actually putting a different meaning on it which, for instance, someone like Father Kolbe might have. It doesn't matter. It's talking about changing views. But in a strict [[Dharma]] sense, it would be, what's the potential here[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Suffering becomes a field of potential|?]] ^13-5
###### 13-6
We begin to see, when we understand more and more the causes and the conditions of [[Dukkha|suffering]], we begin to see the commonality: that I am doing it, you are doing it, everyone is doing this. What's at the root of [[Dukkha|suffering]]? We're feeding [[Dukkha|suffering]] with the [[Dependent Origination|causes and conditions]] and through not [[Insight|understanding]]. And it's that seeing of the commonality that brings a lot of [[compassion]][[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#We begin to see the commonality we are feeding suffering through not understanding|.]] ^13-6
###### 14-1
Traditionally, with [[equanimity]] towards beings, there are phrases. There are phrases that we reflect on, like the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ phrases, and I'm going to read them. So, traditionally, [[equanimity]] practice is introduced when one's been doing a lot of [[compassion]] practice and the heart is very open to [[Dukkha|suffering]]. And then, to balance that, one drops in these reflections of [[equanimity]]. So, the phrases: ^14-1

So this is in the context of one wishing [[Pleasantness|well-being]] for others through the [[compassion]] practice. Then one realizes there's a limit to that. There's another one. I'll put these up if it would be easier, because it's quite a long one: ^14-3

> All beings are the owners of their actions and inherit the results of their actions. Their future is born from such actions, companion to such actions, and the results of their actions will be their home. All actions with intention, be they skilful or harmful, of such acts they will be the heirs.^[Cf. MN 135, AN 5:57, AN 5:161, AN 10:48, AN 10:216[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#"Their future is born from such actions"|]]] ^14-4

So in the context of a heart that's very open to [[Dukkha|suffering]] and touching the [[Dukkha|suffering]] directly, it's very sobering to reflect on that - the limits, and what it is that one's actually not [[Insight|understanding]] in terms of [[Dependent Origination|causes and conditions]] that lead to [[Dukkha|suffering]]. And as I say, there's no blame here. It's seeing a commonality. It's really not about blame. But there is this sense that [[freedom]] is possible, at least to some extent, and so we're seeing the [[Dukkha|suffering]] differently[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#There's no blame here it's seeing a commonality|.]] ^14-5

As beings interested in [[compassion]], interested in the openness of the heart, and living in the world, we find ourself touched by, confronted by, the enormity of [[Dukkha|suffering]] in the world. It's just there. And we see that, and hopefully we're open to that. And we want to be open to that. And we recognize the limits of what _I can do_, the limits of my actions, as I talked about earlier. And also, oftentimes, we look at the world and the situation in the world globally, politically, environmentally, and how little change often seems to be happening. And sometimes there are huge, massive changes that humanity has brought about. But oftentimes, we look, and there's very little change that seems to be happening. And yet, we might have that [[awareness]] - "Not much is happening here. There's an overwhelming amount of [[Dukkha|suffering]]" - yet living with [[love]] and [[compassion]] is the best way to live. It's the best way. So we can say, "What's the point? It doesn't make any difference. It's not going to make any difference." It's the best way to live, even when we're very conscious of the limits and the seeming pointlessness of it, out there[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#And yet living with love and compassion is the best way to live|.]] ^14-6

So I remember, it's changed very suddenly, very quickly, this thing about climate change. You know, there was a relative amount of fuss, certain administrations, etc., Bush, and - "Oh, the science is still uncertain. It's not clear. And so we'll just procrastinate a bit more about what we do about climate change." And then very suddenly it's really an issue. But I felt, even when the science was uncertain, it's like, well, even if we don't know, or even now, if it's too late, what's the best way to live? What's the best way to live? To choose the acts that are actually difficult, that go out of our way, that maybe involve some renunciation. What's getting fed in that? So maybe it makes a difference, maybe it doesn't. Maybe it's wrong science. Maybe it doesn't. What's getting fed if I just go with the "Maybe it doesn't matter. I'll just carry on as usual"? Maybe just this individual is not going to make a difference, but what's getting fed in this heart and the heart of others when I choose to renounce or whatever it is, or go without, or live differently because it _might_ make a difference? What's getting fed? Maybe that's _more_ important, or _as_ important, a question as whether the civilization survives as we know it. What's getting fed[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#What's getting fed if I just go with the "maybe it doesn't matter I'll just carry on as usual"|?]] ^14-7

Not doing very well with time, but it's almost there. Sometimes with this [[compassion]] and [[equanimity]], we can feel as if we're walking a tightrope, and somehow we have to find this middle point. But actually, I think it's rather that a softening comes into the whole thing, a softening of the way one is seeing [[Dukkha|suffering]] and [[Dukkha|suffering]] that can't get resolved. Like, the whole view of it becomes softer and, again, more [[Spaciousness|spacious]]. What is it that allows that softening? More than anything else, it's the [[Insight|understanding]] of [[emptiness]]. It's the opening to [[emptiness]]. It softens our view. And I would say, the more one goes into [[emptiness]], and the more one contemplates [[emptiness]] and understands it, the more [[devotion]] comes into the being. And I mean that in a very broad sense. We're actually more and more then devoted to [[Dukkha|suffering]]. We can devote ourselves to that in a way that's not attached. So [[emptiness]] is not something that's dry or cold. It's certainly not [[Nihilism|nihilistic]]. It doesn't mean nothing exists, and it's just, "Meh, nothing matters." If it was [[nihilism]], it would lead to indifference[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The understanding of emptiness allows a softening of the way one sees suffering|.]] ^15-1

Contemplation of [[emptiness]] is very gradual. I've never met anyone who it was sudden for, no matter what you might read or hear about. It's very, very gradual. Very, very gradual. It's a very difficult thing to understand, and we contemplate it bit by bit. And slowly, slowly we start to - it comes together for us, and it starts to deepen. There are many levels of the depth of what it means, and that's a slow journey, and one has to respect that. It's very gradual. We need to see it over and over. So on this [[retreat]], we're just touching on it in one particular way in the last week, but a few little ways. There are many [[Ways of looking|ways of seeing]] [[emptiness]]. But the point of a practice like what we've introduced this week is that one sees it over and over. One does this over and over until, more and more, the coin drops. It's not a sudden - [snaps fingers] "Ah, I've got it now!" [rubs hands] "I understand now! That's it!" The [[habit]] of [[Avijja|delusion]], of not seeing [[emptiness]], of seeing independently existing things and selves - extremely deep, _extremely_ deep. So part of it is intellectual [[Insight|understanding]], but that also needs to come down into the heart at some point. It's both. And just to remember that [[emptiness]] is one tool. It's a tool we pick up for [[Freedom|freedom from suffering]], for the release from [[Dukkha|suffering]]. So [[compassion]] is another. They're both tools. And there are times when they come together in one kind of flow[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Contemplation of emptiness is very gradual|.]] ^15-2

I remember being - I lived in Boston, and I was there when the September 11 attacks happened, and was actually - I think it was the night or the night after it happened, there was a big gathering in the [[Retreat|meditation centre]], and discussion, and a teacher was there, and this and that. And at some point, it came up, this thing about [[emptiness]], and someone sort of said, "Well, it's all empty, and really nothing happened." [laughter] But totally the inappropriate tool at the time, because for the person who said that, and for, actually, at that time, everyone in the room, _everyone_ in the room, they couldn't pick up that "nothing happened" in a way that [[compassion]] came out of it. Now, ultimately speaking, you _could_ say nothing happened that day. Nothing happened _really_. But unless we can pick that up and really see it that way, unless our [[Insight|understanding]] of [[emptiness]] is so evolved that that really means something for us, in a way that it liberates [[compassion]], then you put down the [[emptiness]] as a tool. Forget about it. It's just words. It's just cleverness. And you pick up the tool of [[compassion]], and you relate in terms of beings [[Dukkha|suffering]] and my response to their [[Dukkha|suffering]]. So it's one tool, and one has to see, when is it appropriate and when not[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Story 9 11 was not "nothing happened"|?]] ^15-3

**Yogi 4**: Is [[compassion]] and [[love]] not empty? ^16-1

**Rob**: [[Compassion]] and [[love]] are empty, too, yes. I'm just concerned about time. [laughter] I'm almost done! ^16-2

One actually eventually _does_ see with this [[emptiness]] business: [[Dukkha|suffering]], too, is empty. It doesn't exist inherently and independently. And as Jeanette was saying, [[compassion]] is empty. [[Love]] is empty. It's all empty. And somehow the very seeing of the [[emptiness]] of that liberates more [[compassion]]. It liberates more [[compassion]] in some completely paradoxical - mystery, beautiful mystery of it - way[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Somehow the very seeing of the emptiness of everything liberates more compassion|.]] ^16-3

How is it that a [[bodhisattva]] can make such a huge aspiration and for such huge amounts of time? Because, in a way, they're holding the [[compassion]] with the [[emptiness]] of it all. It's all empty. I'm empty. The person, 'I' as the giver of [[compassion]]. The [[Dukkha|suffering]] is empty. The beings [[Dukkha|suffering]] are empty. It's all empty. At one level, nothing happened. At another level, I'm right there. That's what allows a [[bodhisattva]] to be a [[bodhisattva]], is that the [[emptiness]] and the [[compassion]] are together. Without that, forget about it. I mean, it's just a monstrous thought[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The bodhisattva can make such a huge aspiration because they're holding the compassion with the emptiness of it all|.]] ^16-4
