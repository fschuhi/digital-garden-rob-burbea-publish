In the tradition, in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddhism" data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhist tradition</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> traditions, there is the concept and the idea of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a></span>. And that's been actually around since the beginning. And about 500, between 500 and 1,000 years - my maths isn't very good, but _a while_ after the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> died ... [laughter] It gained quite a central significance and a slightly different meaning. And what it came to mean in the tradition was someone who aspired very highly with two central aspirations. And one was the aspiration of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, of boundless <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and serving life, serving other beings. And the other was - and sometimes this is, interestingly, neglected - to fully understand the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of all things</a></span>, of all <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a></span>. And those two together - so it's the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span> together - make up that aspiration to live that way, to fulfil both of those potentials, make up the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a></span>. And actually it was originally meant as someone who vowed to become a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> in a future life. But this came about historically - and historians are a little bit unclear when exactly it emerged and how it emerged and where it emerged in the tradition. But it was felt among, obviously, certain practitioners that a while after the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, there was not quite a full enough <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of what the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> originally said - and so that's where the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> piece comes in - and also that somehow the emphasis on <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> had slipped a little bit, and a lot of people were practising just for themselves. So this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="rebirth" class="internal-link">rebirth</a></span> of the emphasis on <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and fullness of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> on <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Two central aspirations for a bodhisattva boundless compassion and understanding emptiness" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Two central aspirations for a bodhisattva boundless compassion and understanding emptiness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1

So a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a></span> is really someone who is totally devoted to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, who lives their life with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> at the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span>, at the core of their priority. Their whole life is kind of revolving around <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, revolving around the wish, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, to serve others. There's a text by <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Shantideva" data-href="Shantideva" class="internal-link">Śāntideva</a></span>, I think eighth century, quite some years after the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, and in a way, it's the epitome of the sort of expression of this aspiration. There are a few extracts from this I'd like to read. Has anyone read from this on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> - no, one of us teachers on this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>? It's expressing this yearning, this wish, this surrender to the centrality of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and the movement of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> in one's life<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > A Bodhisattva lives their life with compassion at the centre of their priority" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#A Bodhisattva lives their life with compassion at the centre of their priority" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2

It's very, very powerful. Very beautiful passage. When <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Shantideva" data-href="Shantideva" class="internal-link">Śāntideva</a></span>, in the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Bodhisattvacaryavatara" data-href="Bodhisattvacaryavatara" class="internal-link">Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra</a></span>_ (that extract's from that) where he puts these ideas forth and this aspiration forth, the chapter before that, it comes, it bursts - he describes it _bursting_ into his <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> as a kind of explosion of this aspiration for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, very sudden. But I wonder, you know, alongside - with the language being extremely ornate and extreme and colourful - I wonder if that's also an exaggeration, and if this aspiration towards <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> necessarily needs to take <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="birth" class="internal-link">birth</a></span> in a sudden way. You know, sudden equals dramatic, and people like that because it's like, "Ooh!" But I wonder if this movement towards making <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> central can actually be a gradual movement. Does it need to be sudden? Or both<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Maybe this aspiration doesnt necessarily need to take birth in a sudden way but can rather be a gradual movement" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Maybe this aspiration doesn't necessarily need to take birth in a sudden way but can rather be a gradual movement" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
And the question I want to go into today is, what allows that kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, first of all to be there, to arise, but second of all to actually stay, to stay there? <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a></span> like that, a huge <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, to have <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> be central in one's life, to have <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> be central, it needs - the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> needs an unshakeability to it. Somehow in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> there needs to be a real sense of, yeah, unshakeability, that it will stand up in the face of whatever <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and all <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. So the bigger the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, in a way, the bigger the unshakeability it needs, the bigger the foundation. So this is really what I want to go into today. And this is where the fourth _brahmavihāra_, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, comes in. How does that come into <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, to allow the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to be stronger and more stable<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > What allows this kind of compassion to arise and stay" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#What allows this kind of compassion to arise and stay" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^2-4
###### 2-5
So, there are these four _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a></span>_: _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">muditā</a></span>_ (<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, which <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Catherine McGee" data-href="Catherine McGee" class="internal-link">Catherine</a></span> talked about yesterday), and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. And I'm sure <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Catherine McGee" data-href="Catherine McGee" class="internal-link">Catherine</a></span> said this, but just to say, _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">muditā</a></span>_ oftentimes gets translated as '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">sympathetic joy</a></span>,' <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> of others. But really it's something much broader than that. It's, you could say, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">spiritual joy</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> that doesn't depend on the ego. So <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> that doesn't depend on me getting something, you telling me how wonderful I am, me getting anything. It's not about the ego. It's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> that's coming from an openness, being touched in life<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Four brahmaviharas; mudita" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Four brahmaviharas; mudita" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-5
###### 3-1
And so, there's _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">muditā</a></span>_, and there's this last _brahmavihāra_, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, or _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity" data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">upekkhā</a></span>_. Now, when the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> talked about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, most of the time he meant <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> in relation to all things and all conditions. So it wasn't just in relationship to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of beings. So in a way, it has two meanings. One is a very broad meaning: just stable, steady, remaining open in the face of whatever happens, whatever conditions there are, whatever conditions arise. And then the almost like 'smaller' meaning, which is actually what I want to go into more today: <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> in its relationship to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, the way that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> needs to be there at the base of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to make that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> really, really unshakeable<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Equanimity in its relationship to compassion" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Equanimity in its relationship to compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
So that, in our lives or in our practices, we give <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to beings. Or we help beings - we work in service or whatever it is. We work to help others. And oftentimes that helps. What we do helps. It's a factor that helps. But sometimes we're wishing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, we're meditating, we're actively involved in helping, and it doesn't help. It's just, the person is still <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> or getting worse. So this is really where the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> needs to come in<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Sometimes we help and it gets better sometimes not and thats where equanimity needs to come in" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Sometimes we help and it gets better sometimes not and that's where equanimity needs to come in" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
So, questions: how does that come into the practice? How do we bring that in, in a very deep way, to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice, this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>? This will be the last time I say this piece, on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> at least, if you can stand it one more time: this balance, balance in the practice that I talk about - when we talk about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>, there's the taking in, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a></span>, the tuning into the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of another, letting the heart resonate, letting that sorrow resonate in the heart, the receiving of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. And the balancing of that with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> that goes out, the balm, that which soothes, that which helps. And feeling that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> on its way out, the balm, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span>, because it bathes oneself on the way out, and it's actually pleasant, and it's actually happy, even if it's just quietly happy, and it's actually <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Recap balancing of receiving and giving" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Recap balancing of receiving and giving" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3
###### 3-4
So this is really, really crucial. And as I said, the balance won't be a set point. It will be dynamic. It will be moving back and forth. But we can develop this skill where we're actually aware where the balance is at any point in time. Am I too long in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a></span> side? Too long with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span> of it? Do I need to sit more in the other side, feeling the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span> of it? There _will_ be <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span>. There will be. And it's a beautiful thing when the heart opens and there are tears at the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world, the huge amount of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world, or those that we know. And the heart resonates with that. And it's a beautiful, precious treasure of what it is to be human, to live in the fullness of our humanity, that we _will_ feel that, and we _will_ shed tears, and we _will_ feel that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Develop the skill to find the dynamic balance" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Develop the skill to find the dynamic balance" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-4
###### 3-5
But unless, in a long-term way, unless we get this, take care of this balance, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> won't have strength and sustainability to it. And that's what we're really talking about: sustainability. What gives <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> - just that it lasts, it can really last? It's really, really important. Now, I'm talking in terms of very specific nuts and bolts of technique with this. But the beautiful thing is it _translates_. Develop the skill on the cushion, in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> hall, of this balance, and it translates when you're sitting opposite someone, listening to them. You're holding their hand. You're with someone. You can actually take that same skill that came from the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation practice</a></span> and translate it into the personal, when you're talking, when you're listening, etc. It's just a skill. But this is really, really fundamental, and it gives the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">buoyancy</a></span>. So as I said, how common it is for people to do the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice and then just feel sunk under it, _burdened_ by <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Often doesn't take very long. Come on a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> like this, a couple of days, and it's like, "_Phew_! Can we move on to the next one?" So it gives it a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">buoyancy</a></span>, a balance, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span>, and this unshakeable quality, all of which are factors of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> coming in<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > You can take the skill from the cushion into the personal life" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#You can take the skill from the cushion into the personal life" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-5
###### 4-1
And then - again, also to repeat something else I've said a few times - the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_. So I'm just harping on and on about _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_. In its most fundamental sense, _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ as non-distractedness - or _less_ distractedness, put it that way - because, again, please remember it's a continuum, _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_. And I can't remember if I said this the other day, but there's such a tendency to think, "Oh, I have it," "I don't have it, and if I don't have it, then I'm a failure," and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>-judge comes in. It's a continuum. But generally speaking, _less_ distractedness - there's actually more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. You can actually see that. So it's a simple equation: less distractedness, more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span>. And that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> begins to absorb into the being in all kinds of ways.

And there's a sense that the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> is being more and more steeped or bathed in something that's very, very <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a></span> and ultimately very, very still.

We didn't really go much into _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, but just to say, there could be another <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> where we spent a month just on _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_, or three months, or whatever it is. And as the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ deepens, it actually brings with it <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>. It goes through a whole range of territory where <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> comes, and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> comes very fully into the being. And that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">muditā</a></span>_, is also a basis for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. When we have <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, when we're familiar and have familiar access with a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> in our life, we have enough. And then we're less shakeable in this life and in relationship to our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> of others.

When we're doing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice, it's very common and very normal to have a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> doing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>: here I am, sitting and walking and kind of flapping as much as I can and trying to generate some <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And that's very normal. It's very natural. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="The self" class="internal-link">The self</a></span> is doing the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And sometimes, _sometimes_ - and I'm sure some of you have tasted this to some degree or other - again, as the practice deepens, as the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ deepens, there can be a sense that it's less <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> doing it. There's just a sense of almost effortlessness, or less effort, less self behind it and more just <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> _present_. There seems to be less _doing_. Now, it can be common, if one gets a taste of that at times, to neglect kind of the doing of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and to think, "Well, the really proper <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is when I don't feel like I'm doing it, or when it doesn't feel to be much self in it." But the whole range is important. And this is really, really important to keep in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. The whole range of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and how <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> feels is important to us<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > The whole range of feeling compassion is important" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The whole range of feeling compassion is important" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1
###### 5-2
So sometimes, it _does_ feel like, "Here I am, flapping and huffing and puffing and trying to get the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> going." There's very much the _self_, _this self_ giving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to _that self -_ very much about self and other, absolutely necessary and fine, and important. So this doing _is_ an aspect of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a></span> wants to alleviate <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and there's a doing in that. There are also the other aspects of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, receiving and holding <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, definitely. But there's also a doing involved. So, you know, if we are in the presence of a child that's starving, we don't say, you know, "I'm feeling really receptive. Tell me all about it. I'm all ears." [laughter] Silly, obviously. You _do_ something. You _act_<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Doing is an aspect of compassion" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Doing is an aspect of compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2
###### 5-3
But this is delicate. Sometimes when we do more, or _feel_ we're doing more, actually, in the doing, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> gets built up because it becomes the doer. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="The self" class="internal-link">The self</a></span> becomes the doer, and with it, a sense of attachment to results. The more doing - not always, but oftentimes - the more doing, the more self and the more attachment to the results. And with that attachment to the results, the less <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Do you see that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Sometimes with more doing there is more self and more attachment to the results" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Sometimes with more doing there is more self and more attachment to the results" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^5-3

I remember, five years ago or something, being <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span> here for three months and at some point getting ill (I can't remember when it was) at some point in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>. And getting ill with a flare-up of Crohn's disease, which is something I suffer from, from time to time. And this is a disease - some of you may know - where they haven't really figured out a cause for it. They don't really understand it. And so, my particular personality, what happens to _me_ when I get it is one part of my being tries to figure it out. And I start experimenting with diet and this alternative and that, and sort of taking notes, and ... [laughs] And I just, you know, it's just my personality. I can't help it. Well, I probably could. But anyway ... [laughter] What I noticed at that time was there were two modes: ^5-4
###### 5-5
**(1)** One, I was <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span>, which is a very 'nothing to do, nowhere to go' mode. And I could just sit with the discomfort of it and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> of it and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span>, etc., and just hold all that in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and non-doing - just being with that, just letting that be held. And that was one mode, which was a very beautiful way of being with something very difficult<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > 1 mode just being with that" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#1 mode just being with that" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-5
###### 5-6
**(2)** And then another mode was very much about doing and trying to take care of myself and trying to figure out what the best thing - what would bring <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > 2 mode trying to figure out what would bring healing" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#2 mode trying to figure out what would bring healing" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-6
###### 5-7
_Both_ are necessary. Just to watch - sometimes, what I noticed was the more that I got into the 'figuring out' mode, out of wanting to heal, oftentimes it felt the more removed I was from the kind of holding of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and the sense of that, the sweetness of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, in a way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Both modes are necessary" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Both modes are necessary" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-7
###### 6-1
_Both_ are necessary though. It's really important to acknowledge that with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, it really is a range, and _all_ of that is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. Even when it looks like one is just tearing one's hair out trying to figure something out or trying to help someone, it's still the expression of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> - very much so<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Acknowledge that with compassion there is a range" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Acknowledge that with compassion there is a range" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-1
###### 6-2
Sometimes, as has been mentioned, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice can seem, at times, for some people, can seem as if it opens out or drops into a whole other sense. There really is a spectrum here. And it's almost like a space of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> opens up, a space. And in that space, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is held, that whatever <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> arises is held in that space. It's a space of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>. And it could feel like it's a space within us, or it could feel like it's a vast space (and we've touched on this before in this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>), a space that's actually the size of the universe. It's infinite<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > A space of compassion" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#A space of compassion" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-2
###### 6-3
This is a very real <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> that can arise for different people at different times. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">Spaciousness</a></span> is also a quality, an _aspect_ of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> - very much so. When there's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span> around that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is a colour, a face, of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. In this practice, the more that we can actually encourage and dwell in that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span>, where whatever <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> there is or whatever <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> could possibly arise in the universe, it actually is effortlessly held. And we can begin to get glimpses of that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> and then actually <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nurture</a></span> it. We can learn to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nurture</a></span> that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> as a very real <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> that begins, again, in a very real way, to change our whole relationship with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world and in ourselves and in this life. That it moves more and more from 'little old me' who has to hold this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> to a kind of - it's just held, and one knows it's held, and one feels it's held. And in that vastness of holding, there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, mixed in with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > The more we encourage this spaciousness the more suffering can be effortlessly held in it" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The more we encourage this spaciousness the more suffering can be effortlessly held in it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-3
###### 6-4
And sometimes, for some people, this can be a very - well, almost always is a very beautiful sense, even a mystical or a religious sense, and that's very much a part of it. The <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span> can change. They can open out. And something very beautiful is born there which we can then ... not _snatch_ at and not try to _keep_, but encourage, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nurture</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourish</a></span> that opening of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>.

Very beautiful, speaking about this holding, which for some people takes a very personal flavour. And in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tibetan Buddhism" data-href="Tibetan Buddhism" class="internal-link">Tibetan traditions</a></span> and other of the Buddhist traditions, very much the relationship with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a></span>, the relationship with the guru or the root guru, as someone one prays to, as someone who's actually holding, in the vastness of their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, one's own <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. And you get the same thing in mystical <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Christianity" class="internal-link">Christianity</a></span>, that the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jesus" data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">cosmic Christ</a></span> or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> of Christ is actually holding the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the universe. That could be personal, but it could also be impersonal - don't need to necessarily introduce any figure into it. And people are different, and they have different <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">tendencies</a></span>. This is a tendency that can open. It brings a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. One possibility<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > This can take on a very personal flavour" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#This can take on a very personal flavour" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-7
###### 6-8
When we speak, when we use the language of '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a></span>,' and especially when we hear <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Shantideva" data-href="Shantideva" class="internal-link">Śāntideva</a></span> and this kind of thing, it's an incredibly high aspiration. I mean, it's almost like <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>-blowingly high, _almost_ unreal. When we hear it, it's almost - I mean, that's the flavour that comes off, is a kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>-boggling unreality to it. And yet there are people who take it on. It comes to become something real for them. It translates in a way that becomes something real. But whether we're moved by that or repelled by that, that's actually not what I want to so much dwell on. I want to go into, what allows _our_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> - wherever we are in that - to become unshakeable, or more and more unshakeable<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > The aspiration of a bodhisattva is mind-blowingly high" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The aspiration of a bodhisattva is mind-blowingly high" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^6-8
###### 7-1
So we can have a sense of '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a></span>' being a very high aspiration. We also need to respect: "Where are we? Where am I in all this? How is it for me right now, when I'm in a situation with someone that's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, someone I know or don't know or I care about? Where am I _really_ in my humanity?" And sometimes - you know, this is really something, I think, to give very careful <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to in our life - sometimes we neglect ourselves and our needs. Sometimes we're _too_ cautious perhaps. And perhaps there _is_ a place for stretching ourselves, stretching our limits, just saying, "To <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="hell" class="internal-link">hell</a></span> with myself and my self-concern," and just a kind of abandon. Maybe that has its place. Or rather, it definitely has its place, but it needs to be approached with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span>. And stretching the limits of one's stamina and one's endurance in serving and in giving - there is the place for that. And I'm not necessarily talking about something, you know, like literally giving up one's life. I'm just talking about little ways. Just <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>-concern. Sometimes - and you must have come across this - you're doing the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice, and something's not feeling quite right for _you_. Either the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>'s niggling, or something's not right. It can be very skilful to just drop in, "It doesn't matter how I feel right now. It doesn't matter. I'm just giving the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to you." You can just play with this kind of abandonment of self-concern - not all the time, but just sometimes<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > We have to respect where we are in our humanity" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#We have to respect where we are in our humanity" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-1

But this is a very delicate area and needs a lot of careful <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>. Sometimes we need to ask, "What are my needs, what are _my_ needs, in this situation? What are my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span> too?" I'm sure many of you have had a situation, or have situations, where we are in a relationship or a friendship or a situation with someone where they are <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. The other is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. And perhaps it's going on for quite a while. It's chronic. And we are in a caretaking role in some form or another. So maybe it's just a friendship. And sometimes, even in a friendship or relationship with a person who is bringing <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> on themselves, and you can see that because of the choices they're making towards, whatever it is, alcohol, drugs, the way they're living - you can just see, and yet you care about this person, and you want to live with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> there. And one can very understandably, very naturally feel in that situation, "Here, in the ongoingness of this relationship, my needs are not being met.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > It can happen that we feel that our needs are not being met" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#It can happen that we feel that our needs are not being met" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^7-2
###### 7-3
And so this is, I think, very common when one finds oneself in this situation with a friend or any kind of relationship where this is going on in. And especially difficult when the person seems to be bringing it on for themselves, if you've ever been close with an addict or something like that. It's a very difficult relationship to keep and keep healthy. And the question, am I taking care of my needs in this situation? Am I taking care of my needs? Not easy. Because there will be in that - if there's friendship, and if there's a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span> of friendship and relationship - there will be loneliness that comes in. Sometimes it can feel like the person is just not available. Either they literally don't have the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span> to be there, or they're just checked out. And there can be loneliness come in. We don't feel met. We don't feel seen. We don't feel like there's a flow of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and friendship there. We don't feel loved<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Its especially difficult if the person is bringing the suffering on for themselves" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#It's especially difficult if the person is bringing the suffering on for themselves" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-3
###### 7-4
So this is all really important stuff to be aware of. What are my needs? What's going on here? And what's it important to take care of? And it can also be complicated by other factors. Sometimes we're with someone who's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and we actually, if we're honest, we look inside, we notice, or we may notice, we want to be needed. We want to be needed. And so, in a way, this is a very weird one. Something in us actually has an investment in keeping the other <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> because - and this is a horrible word, but in some psychotherapies they call it 'co-dependency.' It's actually a mutual investment in someone <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and the other person kind of wanting to keep them down<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Codependency" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Codependency" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-4
###### 8-1
We have to ask, "Do I want to feel needed? Do I need to feel needed? What's going on there if I do? Do I want to be recognized for my efforts, for the efforts of service and care?" So these are not easy questions. And in a way, some of that is just human. When we give service, when we give, when we're compassionate, there is a part of us, a very natural human part that wants to be - wants our efforts to be recognized. So the question is, or a question is, is it possible to get what we need in a healthy way - in a _healthy_ way, that it's not coming into the relationship in an undercurrent, undercover way, that we're actually conscious and getting what we need in a healthy way? Not easy, not easy territory at all<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Is it possible to get what we need in a healthy way" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Is it possible to get what we need in a healthy way" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-1

And sometimes when there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and a situation of service to someone, and we feel frustrated, and we feel it's difficult, and we feel <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> is creeping in, and we feel judgment is creeping in - especially if they are not handling it well, or causing it for themselves, making wrong choices - again, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ to oneself, not to neglect that.

Oftentimes, though, we don't have that same kind of self-interest. It's not a friend or a relative or a partner or whatever that we're working with. There isn't that self-interest. But still the question, what is it that allows, that helps, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> to stay strong, to stay steady, to stay tender? So when I say 'strength,' I really mean to stay open, that the heart stays open, and stays soft and tender. What allows that? Often in the world we do see - it's clear. We look at another, and we can see. We look at others, and we see they are, you could say - one way of putting it is they're causing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> for themselves or others, and out of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span>. They're just not seeing the consequences of their actions or their way of being. And it's clear, and we look and we see that. And this is partly why <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> is - why I want to speak about it. It's so important. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> needs to come in<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > What is it that helps the compassion to stay strong" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#What is it that helps the compassion to stay strong" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-3

A <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> - something that _looks_ like it but on closer inspection is really _not_ it - the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> is indifference. It's just, the heart's actually shut down, cold, disinterested, disconnected, whereas <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> is actually open. It's still tender. It's still soft. It's interested. It's present. So oftentimes, indifference can even be dressed up in spiritual language. But it's not <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. Spiritual language in different traditions, you know, we have the notion of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a></span>. And how often people - the temptation is to hear, "They're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>" - the attitude - "It's just their <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a></span>. It's their <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a></span>, and they need to go through it." That's an Eastern concept. Or in the West, it's, you know, "God's punishing them," or something. These are taking spiritual concepts and using them in immature <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understandings</a></span>.

So very easy to see this in the context of a political context, the limits, even in a democracy. You know, the tendency is to think, "What difference does it make if I vote or not?" Or certainly to see it very clearly with globalization. To realize the actual limits of one's actions and just to see: we are limited. Or even in other contexts, you have to see that here, one may be giving service or acting compassionately or trying to alleviate the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and it's only one strand in a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">web of conditions</a></span>.

For example, I mean, it's interesting giving talks, for many reasons. But one gives a talk, and one wants to help. One wants to offer something to help. And it's important, you know, for me to reflect, and I think for everyone who's doing this kind of thing, or any kind of act, to reflect that one gives a talk - there's so much going on. Like right now, there's so much going on making up this talk. It may seem to me or to you that _I'm_ giving the talk. Now, of course, at one level, I am. But actually, and if anyone has ever been involved in any kind of performing art, what you become aware of is, the talk is actually a collaboration. I'm actually doing most of the talking. [laughter] Although this group's interesting! [laughter] But anyway, it's actually a collaboration. So I still have this piece of paper and the notes and what I want to get through in the course of the talk. But there's something in the way everyone is present or not present, wakeful or not wakeful, interested or not, _everything_ - you know, if you ate too much for lunch, that's going to affect this talk. Thank you very much. [laughter] It's a totally collaborative effort. So what comes out of the mouth, the whole <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, the whole feel of it is actually a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span>.

It's just one strand. And then the words come out, and _some_ of them are heard - let's be honest - _some_ of them are heard and some not. And its effects also, a whole - where's it landing? It's landing in a lot of different <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind state" data-href="Mind state" class="internal-link">mind states</a></span>. It's landing in a lot of different practice histories. It's landing in a lot of different life situations. And one will leave this talk, this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and go out and meet a whole set of other conditions. So a talk, or a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma teaching</a></span>, or whatever it is, an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, is actually just a seed.

I'm not quite sure where to put them in. I'll put them in here, in terms of conditions. He's talking about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a></span>, and he's talking about the ripening of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a></span> from the past. So this could be, we've done something that we regret, and then we feel the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> of that regret, that remorse or guilt. Or it could be that something bad has happened to us, and we have that memory. Something from the past is having its effect in the present: <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a></span>. He says something very interesting in a few different passages. When the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, when the heart, is small, restricted, that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a></span> ripens - the memory of what we did, or what happened to us or whatever - ripens in that context of the restricted, the constricted heart. In the unrestricted heart, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Immeasurability" data-href="Immeasurability" class="internal-link">immeasurable</a></span> heart - so one that is either <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Immeasurability" data-href="Immeasurability" class="internal-link">immeasurable</a></span> through <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, one of the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a></span>_, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Immeasurability" data-href="Immeasurability" class="internal-link">immeasurable</a></span> that way, or unrestricted through _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a></span>_ or through <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> - in the unrestricted heart, when that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a></span> ripens, when it comes up, when the memory comes up or the effects from the past come up, memory or otherwise, it's in a very different context. And the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> said it will barely be noticed.

So the smaller the heart, at any time, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a></span> comes up - extremely massive effect. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> gives a few analogies - one of them is a salt crystal in a cup of water. How does the water taste after that?

And the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> says it will come up, but barely noticeable, barely making an impression when the heart is really ...

Another analogy he gives is - and this just says something about the sort of judicial system of his time, but also at this time in different countries - that if you're a poor man, you can be thrown in jail for a long, long time, and no one cares, and you just get stuck in jail. But if you're a wealthy man, it doesn't happen. You don't get stuck in jail for a long time. You don't get thrown in jail. Not a very nice analogy, but the riches of the - again, what we're nurturing inside and the openness of the heart, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a></span> of this as a real wealth, _real_ wealth.^[The Buddha's words about the unrestricted, immeasurable heart, together with his analogies of the salt crystal and the poor man thrown in jail, are found at AN 3:101, _Loṇaphala Sutta_] ^10-2

And when I was there, I came across the story of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Maximilian Kolbe" class="internal-link">Maximilian Kolbe</a></span> - hope I remember it. He was a Polish man who became a Franciscan priest and monk ('Franciscan' is a denomination of Catholic monk and priest), I think in his early twenties, and lived in Poland and some time in Asia. And then the Nazis overtook Poland, and he was thrown in jail immediately just as a suspect, because of being a monk and a Catholic. And then released<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Story Maximilian Kolbe" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Story Maximilian Kolbe" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-3

He went back to his friary and hid - some way or another - hid 3,000 Polish refugees there, 2,000 of whom were Jewish. And he hid them there, obviously under great danger to himself, great threat to himself. After a while, it was found out, and he and some of his colleagues were sent to Auschwitz, in the early part of the camp's existence. And after he'd been there a few months, just a couple of months, one day in his block, in his cell block, a prisoner went missing. And so the assumption on behalf of the Nazi guards was that this prisoner had escaped. It actually turned out that he had drowned in a latrine either by suicide or accident. But anyway, the assumption was that he had escaped, and the punishment if a person escaped from a cell block was that ten men were chosen at random and executed from that cell block. And so, ten were chosen from his block, and one of them, one of these ten, on being chosen - he was actually a Polish resistance fighter who was in Auschwitz. There were a lot of political prisoners in Auschwitz at the time. And one of them immediately broke down. He was picked as one of the ten. He immediately broke down: "How are my wife and children going to get on without me? You know, I've got young children. I've got a wife." And he immediately broke down. Didn't make any impact<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Punishment for escaped prisoner" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Punishment for escaped prisoner" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-4

But then Father Kolbe, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Maximilian Kolbe" class="internal-link">Maximilian Kolbe</a></span>, stepped forward, and he said, "I will take the place of this man." And miraculously the commandant, the Nazi commandant, actually agreed to let this happen. So the punishment - this isn't very nice to hear, but the punishment was that they were thrown into a little room. I've actually seen the room. It's a tiny room, I thought. It was so tiny, I thought they must have died from asphyxiation, but actually they were left there to starve. And so just thrown into this little room at the bottom of the stairs and left there to starve. And usually people would last a few days before, basically, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> starts to decompose. After two weeks, the camp authorities needed to put more victims in the room, basically, so they went down to clear it out and found four of them still alive. Three of them were not conscious but still alive, and there was the last one still alive, which was actually Father Kolbe. And they killed - well, the camp executioner killed them with lethal injection. That's how they killed them. And he was completely conscious at the time of his <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > I will take the place of this man to starve to death" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#I will take the place of this man to starve to death" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-1

What's going on? There's another lovely ... Do you know who <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Damien the Leper" class="internal-link">Damien the Leper</a></span> is? Have you heard that? Just briefly, he was also actually a Catholic monk in the Dominican order. At one time, one of the Hawaiian Islands was a leper colony. So they would just use it to keep lepers. No one else lived there but lepers because of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of contagion. And he volunteered to be a minister to the lepers, to go and live out the rest of his life on this island with nothing but thousands and thousands of lepers. And he volunteered to do that. And he was a doctor, and he ministered to them, and he also was their religious minister. Eventually, I think it took twelve years, but he eventually <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">contracted</a></span> leprosy and eventually died<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Story Damien the Leper" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Story Damien the Leper" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-2

And someone said, not on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, but just a week or so ago, I was meeting with them, and she said to me, "It feels like the gods have abandoned me."

It transforms, and it deepens, and you know, the beautiful words of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">Jesus</a></span> in the Garden of Gethsemane - he knows what's coming, and he says, "Thy will be done."^[Matthew 26:42] _Thy_ will, not mine, be done.

There's this movement into - as much as there's a movement of a path of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span> into depth, there's a movement of path of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a></span> into depths.

So it deepens, but I think, when I reflect on what must have been going on - we don't know what was going on with Father Kolbe. What must have been going on? Something happens in the deepening of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a></span>. And this is what's perhaps important: the view of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> changes. The view that we have of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> changes. And in this case, it was through <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a></span>. So you can be - _I_ feel pretty sure that Father Kolbe was seeing that situation differently. There was something in the depth of his <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a></span> and sense of, in this case, sense of God, or whatever you want to call it, something that allowed him to see that situation differently, so that the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is not the whole of reality. This is very interesting. Or that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is not as real as it seems. Or that the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, again, is held in something else. It's held in something else. All of these are different views of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. They're different ways that the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is seen and related to<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > The view of suffering changes" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The view of suffering changes" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-2

**(2)** The second aspect of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a></span>, in a more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> sense, strictly <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> or _conventional_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> sense, is that **<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">freedom from suffering</a></span> is possible**.

**Yogi 3**: But Rob, when you say it's meaningless do you mean that - what is the meaning? The meaning is - the meaning of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> is to be awakened from it? ^13-4
###### 13-5
**Rob**: Yeah, perhaps that's not the best word. Rather that it's not just a random thing that one has to just - either it doesn't have a meaning, or one just has to put up with, and one doesn't understand, and it's just there. So in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, in the strictly <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">sense of faith</a></span>, it's like, "I can understand something here that transforms it." So, just saying, it becomes a field of potential and a moment of potential. And other ways would be actually putting a different meaning on it which, for instance, someone like Father Kolbe might have. It doesn't matter. It's talking about changing views. But in a strict <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> sense, it would be, what's the potential here<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Suffering becomes a field of potential" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Suffering becomes a field of potential" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^13-5

We begin to see, when we understand more and more the causes and the conditions of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, we begin to see the commonality: that I am doing it, you are doing it, everyone is doing this.

Traditionally, with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> towards beings, there are phrases. There are phrases that we reflect on, like the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ phrases, and I'm going to read them. So, traditionally, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> practice is introduced when one's been doing a lot of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> practice and the heart is very open to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. And then, to balance that, one drops in these reflections of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. So, the phrases: ^14-1

> All beings are the owners of their actions and inherit the results of their actions. Their future is born from such actions, companion to such actions, and the results of their actions will be their home. All actions with intention, be they skilful or harmful, of such acts they will be the heirs.^[Cf. MN 135, AN 5:57, AN 5:161, AN 10:48, AN 10:216] ^14-4

So in the context of a heart that's very open to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and touching the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> directly, it's very sobering to reflect on that - the limits, and what it is that one's actually not <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> in terms of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">causes and conditions</a></span> that lead to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. And as I say, there's no blame here. It's seeing a commonality. It's really not about blame. But there is this sense that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> is possible, at least to some extent, and so we're seeing the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> differently<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Theres no blame here its seeing a commonality" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#There's no blame here it's seeing a commonality" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-5

As beings interested in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, interested in the openness of the heart, and living in the world, we find ourself touched by, confronted by, the enormity of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the world. It's just there. And we see that, and hopefully we're open to that. And we want to be open to that. And we recognize the limits of what _I can do_, the limits of my actions, as I talked about earlier. And also, oftentimes, we look at the world and the situation in the world globally, politically, environmentally, and how little change often seems to be happening. And sometimes there are huge, massive changes that humanity has brought about. But oftentimes, we look, and there's very little change that seems to be happening. And yet, we might have that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> - "Not much is happening here. There's an overwhelming amount of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>" - yet living with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is the best way to live. It's the best way. So we can say, "What's the point? It doesn't make any difference. It's not going to make any difference." It's the best way to live, even when we're very conscious of the limits and the seeming pointlessness of it, out there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > And yet living with love and compassion is the best way to live" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#And yet living with love and compassion is the best way to live" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-6

So I remember, it's changed very suddenly, very quickly, this thing about climate change. You know, there was a relative amount of fuss, certain administrations, etc., Bush, and - "Oh, the science is still uncertain. It's not clear. And so we'll just procrastinate a bit more about what we do about climate change." And then very suddenly it's really an issue. But I felt, even when the science was uncertain, it's like, well, even if we don't know, or even now, if it's too late, what's the best way to live? What's the best way to live? To choose the acts that are actually difficult, that go out of our way, that maybe involve some renunciation. What's getting fed in that? So maybe it makes a difference, maybe it doesn't. Maybe it's wrong science. Maybe it doesn't. What's getting fed if I just go with the "Maybe it doesn't matter. I'll just carry on as usual"? Maybe just this individual is not going to make a difference, but what's getting fed in this heart and the heart of others when I choose to renounce or whatever it is, or go without, or live differently because it _might_ make a difference? What's getting fed? Maybe that's _more_ important, or _as_ important, a question as whether the civilization survives as we know it. What's getting fed<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Whats getting fed if I just go with the maybe it doesnt matter Ill just carry on as usual" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#What's getting fed if I just go with the maybe it doesn't matter I'll just carry on as usual" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^14-7

Not doing very well with time, but it's almost there. Sometimes with this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, we can feel as if we're walking a tightrope, and somehow we have to find this middle point. But actually, I think it's rather that a softening comes into the whole thing, a softening of the way one is seeing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> that can't get resolved. Like, the whole view of it becomes softer and, again, more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a></span>. What is it that allows that softening? More than anything else, it's the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. It's the opening to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. It softens our view. And I would say, the more one goes into <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, and the more one contemplates <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> and understands it, the more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a></span> comes into the being. And I mean that in a very broad sense. We're actually more and more then devoted to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. We can devote ourselves to that in a way that's not attached. So <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> is not something that's dry or cold. It's certainly not <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nihilism" data-href="Nihilism" class="internal-link">nihilistic</a></span>. It doesn't mean nothing exists, and it's just, "Meh, nothing matters." If it was <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nihilism" class="internal-link">nihilism</a></span>, it would lead to indifference<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > The understanding of emptiness allows a softening of the way one sees suffering" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The understanding of emptiness allows a softening of the way one sees suffering" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-1

Contemplation of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> is very gradual. I've never met anyone who it was sudden for, no matter what you might read or hear about. It's very, very gradual. Very, very gradual. It's a very difficult thing to understand, and we contemplate it bit by bit. And slowly, slowly we start to - it comes together for us, and it starts to deepen. There are many levels of the depth of what it means, and that's a slow journey, and one has to respect that. It's very gradual. We need to see it over and over. So on this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, we're just touching on it in one particular way in the last week, but a few little ways. There are many <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>. But the point of a practice like what we've introduced this week is that one sees it over and over. One does this over and over until, more and more, the coin drops. It's not a sudden - [snaps fingers] "Ah, I've got it now!" [rubs hands] "I understand now! That's it!" The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>, of not seeing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, of seeing independently existing things and selves - extremely deep, _extremely_ deep. So part of it is intellectual <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, but that also needs to come down into the heart at some point. It's both. And just to remember that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> is one tool. It's a tool we pick up for <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">freedom from suffering</a></span>, for the release from <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is another. They're both tools. And there are times when they come together in one kind of flow<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Contemplation of emptiness is very gradual" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Contemplation of emptiness is very gradual" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-2

I remember being - I lived in Boston, and I was there when the September 11 attacks happened, and was actually - I think it was the night or the night after it happened, there was a big gathering in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">meditation centre</a></span>, and discussion, and a teacher was there, and this and that. And at some point, it came up, this thing about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, and someone sort of said, "Well, it's all empty, and really nothing happened." [laughter] But totally the inappropriate tool at the time, because for the person who said that, and for, actually, at that time, everyone in the room, _everyone_ in the room, they couldn't pick up that "nothing happened" in a way that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> came out of it. Now, ultimately speaking, you _could_ say nothing happened that day. Nothing happened _really_. But unless we can pick that up and really see it that way, unless our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> is so evolved that that really means something for us, in a way that it liberates <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, then you put down the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> as a tool. Forget about it. It's just words. It's just cleverness. And you pick up the tool of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and you relate in terms of beings <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> and my response to their <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>.
