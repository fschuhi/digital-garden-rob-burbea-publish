| <span class="blockid">1-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#This talk is about the dimensions we uncover when practicing metta\|This talk is about the dimensions we uncover when practicing metta]]<br/><hr class="cell">Tonight I'd like to talk about some of the aspects of _mettā_, of loving-kindness, some of the dimensions that we begin to uncover, begin to feel, when we explore, when we move into this practice. | <span class="blockid">1-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Metta is a constallation of feelings\|Metta is a constallation of feelings]]<br/><hr class="cell">Okay, what I want to talk about today is a little bit some of the different expressions of mettā, some of the different dimensions of loving-kindness. So first just to restate something I said in the instructions this morning, which is that mettā is not just one feeling. We have this word, mettā, and we go looking for _one_ thing: "What is that mettā?" And try and see, "Have I got it? Have I not got it?" And just to really be conscious that it's not one feeling. Could more accurately talk about perhaps a constellation of feelings, when it expresses itself as a feeling at all. There's a constellation of feelings, and I've said, sometimes it will take on, it will feel to be, to have, a slightly different colour, a slightly different flavour. Sometimes it's very calming, very soothing. Sometimes there's a quality of healing in it. Sometimes it's a very bright energy, a very sort of luminous energy. Sometimes bubbly. Sometimes there's a real warmth in it, or gentleness. So in the practice, however it seems to kind of come up and manifest, it's fine, and to really allow those differences, allow those differences of flavours, of colours. And just to notice and feel. It's all included in what we mean by mettā. |
| <span class="blockid">1-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Metta can never just be a feeling\|Metta can never just be a feeling]]<br/><hr class="cell">So, to reiterate something we've already said a few times: to remember that _mettā_ can never just be a feeling. Sometimes we are just having that faith in planting the seeds, seeds of intentionality, and how profound - very simple but profound that is, and powerful. |  |
| <span class="blockid">1-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#It's more a constellation of feelings\|It's more a constellation of feelings]]<br/><hr class="cell">But even when _mettā_ _is_ felt as a feeling - and we have a _feeling_ of loving-kindness - even then, it's not just one feeling. And I sort of mentioned this in the morning instructions the other day. And you may have noticed this in your practice. In those moments, in those times when there is a feeling, there is something felt, in the heart, or in the body, might _more_ accurately talk about a constellation of feelings. So sometimes the _mettā_ feels warm. It's felt as a warmth. Sometimes it's a kind of bubbly feeling. There's a happiness with it. Sometimes it's very soothing. Sometimes calming. Sometimes it's very bright, very luminous. Sometimes very gentle. And the loving-kindness, the felt experience of loving-kindness, can go through all those different textures, different colours, different flavours. It's actually important to feel that. And this is partly why we keep encouraging this sensitivity that's developed in your practice, particularly sensitivity to the body, and just actually _allowing_ the _mettā_ to take these subtly different flavours, at times. Sometimes, when it has that feeling, to go through that, and really just allowing that. |  |
| <span class="blockid">1-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#We need to discriminate between metta and compassion\|We need to discriminate between metta and compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">And you may also have noticed, many of you may also have noticed by now, sometimes one's doing _mettā_ to oneself, or _mettā_ to the friend or the benefactor, and we are conscious of our suffering or their suffering, and the _mettā_ takes on the colour, the flavour, of compassion at that point. So, certainly, we need to discriminate between these two, between _mettā_ and compassion, and be quite specific and precise about what is _mettā_ and what is compassion. But they also overlap. And when the _mettā_, as many of you will have experienced already, when it touches suffering, it has the flavour of compassion. And just to allow that, just to allow that. It's part of the constellation of feelings that _mettā_ is. | <span class="blockid">1-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Metta can also be colored by compassion\|Metta can also be colored by compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">And sometimes, and you may have noticed this already, sometimes we're doing mettā practice and we're aware of our own or someone's suffering, and then the mettā meets that suffering and actually is then coloured - and perhaps quite strongly at that point - by compassion, by the kind of tenderness of compassion. And we'll go into quite a lot of detail, the difference between compassion and mettā. But really not to worry too much about that. In a way, it's just words, and not to strangle the thing too much with words and concepts. So very much to allow the different flavours. |
| <span class="blockid">1-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Categories of people we direct metta to are not inherently fixed\|Categories of people we direct metta to are not inherently fixed]]<br/><hr class="cell">So, there's a constellation of possible feelings. And we go through these categories. We're beginning to unfold these categories. And so, we have the self, the benefactor, the friend, etc. And it's important to recognize that these categories are not fixed. Someone is not _inherently_ a friend, or _inherently_ - later we'll do the difficult person, or neutral - that they're very fluid categories. So someone might be a benefactor or a friend, in that category, and then they say the wrong thing to us. [laughter] And you know, they get relegated a couple of divisions. [laughter] And hopefully, you heal that, and they get promoted again. [laughter] | <span class="blockid">1-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Categories are not fixed they are just a tool\|Categories are not fixed, they are just a tool]]<br/><hr class="cell">And then we have these categories that we've been slowly going through. We started with the self, and the benefactor, and the friend, and it will go on. And to really see that this is just a tool. It's just a tool. The aspiration of mettā is for something that extends itself boundlessly, without limit. So usually our love is quite narrow in its scope. It's just towards ourselves, hopefully, and maybe a few people around us that we care about. And the aspiration of mettā is a really boundless love, completely without limit. And the categories are just a tool to help us move towards that boundlessness, that's all. So there's nothing fixed about them. A person can be our benefactor one day, and then they say the wrong thing, and they get a demotion. [laughter] And they find themselves in the difficult category. And then hopefully we work it out, and they get a rise, and they're back to benefactor or friend or whatever it is. But there's nothing fixed about this at all. And similarly, of course, the difficult person can rise through the ranks. Just to see: it's just a tool. It's just a tool. |
| <span class="blockid">1-7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Having categories is a technique to extend the range of metta towards boundlessness\|Having categories is a technique to extend the range of metta towards boundlessness]]<br/><hr class="cell">But they're not - there is nothing fixed. The whole practice is very fluid. The reason for the categories - it's just a technique to gradually extend the range of the _mettā_ towards this boundlessness, which is the aspiration of the _mettā_. So it's just a tool. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Due to our cultural background it can be difficult to orient metta towards the self\|Due to our cultural background, it can be difficult to orient metta towards the self]]<br/><hr class="cell">And we start with the self, and we've spent two days with that. This has already been said, but just to say it again: how common it is, actually, for that to be quite a difficult orientation for the _mettā_. Difficult to direct the _mettā_ towards the self - not for everyone, but it's really quite common. And there are all kinds of reasons for this. We can talk about childhood and family and school, and many, many possible reasons. And a lot of it, in fact, is just cultural. Sometimes, looking at the culture we're in at the moment, it's almost like there's a bit of a mixed message out there, about how one is in relationship to oneself. In many respects, perhaps looking at the culture, we can see that we're in a bit of a culture of selfishness: "me first." Maybe a few people around me, but "me first." And somehow with that, the message from the culture - and sometimes it's not even overt - the message is, "To love oneself, to cherish oneself in a healthy way, is somehow selfish." There's quite a confusing message, just that we're getting from the culture. | <span class="blockid">1-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Category "the self"\|Category "the self"]]<br/><hr class="cell">And so the first one we start with, which we spent two days on, is the self. And the huge importance of giving love to ourselves, of really having a relationship with ourselves of mettā. It's really crucial. It's crucial for our lives. It's crucial also for our practice of mettā. And so it's interesting: sometimes, for some people, this is very difficult, for all kinds of reasons, to give mettā to oneself - for, you know, reasons in the family, upbringing, or the education; all kinds of reasons. It can be very challenging, actually, to give mettā to oneself. And some of the reasons sometimes are just cultural. We live in a culture that - it's a weird mixed message, I feel sometimes. It's a culture of individuality, of self, of _what I want_ and going out to get that. And at the same time, the notion of loving oneself in a healthy way is often regarded as selfish. So we're getting this very mixed message. And I remember last year on this retreat being struck by, especially when we moved on to compassion, how many people found it difficult to stay with giving love to themselves. |
| <span class="blockid">2-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#We might even have the view that it is selfish\|We might even have the view that it is selfish]]<br/><hr class="cell">But in a way, whatever the reasons (and it can be quite complex), we often, or many people find themselves in a situation where it's quite difficult to direct the love towards themselves, the intention of love towards themselves. Or even to have an idea or a belief, a view, that it's not a good idea, that it's selfish. And just to have that view. | <span class="blockid">2-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#It can be a habit to not give love to ourselves\|It can be a habit to not give love to ourselves]]<br/><hr class="cell">So the culture might say it's selfish, and for whatever reasons or combination of reasons, that's there, or it may be there. And sometimes it just ends up that's a habit. It's a habit to not give love to ourselves, or to regard it as indulgent or selfish or whatever. And somehow, through practice, we have to weaken that habit. So every time we say, "May I be well, may I be happy, may I be peaceful," we're actually weakening that habit. And not to underestimate the power of that. The analogy I gave this morning, the Buddha's actual words, "Drop by drop, the bucket is filled." |
| <span class="blockid">2-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Metta weakens the unhelpful habits of not relating to our self\|Metta weakens the unhelpful habits of (not) relating to our self]]<br/><hr class="cell">All of that - quite complex, the reasons for it, but _might_ be just a habit, might have just become a habit of viewing, a habit of a way of relating to our self, or a way of not relating to our self. And as such, one of the functions of _mettā_ practice is just to weaken that habit. Again, it's not a very glamorous way of looking at the Dharma, but it's extremely powerful: we're just weakening habits that are unhelpful. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Metta towards ourselves is necessary for our practice\|Metta towards ourselves is necessary for our practice]]<br/><hr class="cell">And it's so necessary, so necessary for our lives, for our path, for our practice, to be in the context of love for oneself. That is the inner climate of the way we're moving through our life, and the way we're moving through our practice. So necessary. And just to repeat, actually, that quote from the Buddha again, so powerful : |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#You'll never find anyone more deserving of metta than yourself\|You'll never find anyone more deserving of metta than yourself]]<br/><hr class="cell">You could search the entire universe for someone more deserving of loving-kindness than yourself, and you will not find that person. You will not find that being.^[A similar quote is attributed to the Buddha in Sharon Salzberg, _Lovingkindness: The Revolutionary Art of Happiness_ (Boston: Shambhala, 1995), 31. For the canonical passage, see Ud 5:1] | <span class="blockid">2-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#According to the Buddha your're worthy of giving love to yourself\|According to the Buddha, your're worthy of giving love to yourself]]<br/><hr class="cell">And the Buddha also, when he talked about this, giving love to ourselves, he said something very strong. He said, "You could search the entire universe for someone more deserving of love and compassion than yourself, and you won't find that person, you won't find that being." So there's something - to me, it's a very powerful statement. There's something he's pointing to. Whatever we think we've done or not done, or worth or not worth, or however we rate ourselves and measure ourselves and all that disease, really, the Buddha is saying you're worthy of love, you're worthy of giving love to yourself. This is an enormously powerful statement. And to see, as I said before, the necessity of this, that when we begin to love ourselves, we are that much more available to giving love to others. And in our love we are that much less needy in what we are going to get back, and the mettā can be more pure. Through loving ourselves, we're not only giving a gift to ourselves. We're actually giving a gift to others, to humanity. |
| <span class="blockid">2-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#To give love to ourselves becomes a foundation from which we can give to others\|To give love to ourselves becomes a foundation from which we can give to others]]<br/><hr class="cell">Something to really reflect on. It's not about what we think we deserve. It's not about what we think we've done, or how we think we measure up. What we haven't done, what we've said, what we didn't say, what goes through our minds, what we think of ourselves - we're saying all of that's actually irrelevant. Just the fact of your being means that you deserve it. And to give the love to ourselves is actually a gift to others, begins to become a foundation from which we can give to others, and actually, an indispensable foundation for making that a steady and a deep giving that lasts. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Near enemy\|Near enemy]]<br/><hr class="cell">So there's the self, and then there are the categories of the friend, and the benefactor, which we've done these days. Now, has anyone mentioned the word 'near enemy' yet? No? Okay, well people are smiling, so they've heard of it. But in this retreat, has anyone? | <span class="blockid">2-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#The near enemy of metta is attached love\|The near enemy of metta is attached love]]<br/><hr class="cell">So there's the self, and then there's the benefactor and the friend, which we've gone into. Sometimes when we talk about mettā, we talk about it being unattached, and it's said that the near enemy of mettā - that's a funny phrase; it means what kind of looks like mettā at first but actually isn't. So something that bears a lot of similarity but actually isn't. And the near enemy of mettā is what's called attached love. In other words, "I'll love you _if_," and then a whole list of whatever. So just to see in the practice when this comes up, when the mettā has more attachment in it or less attachment in it or whatever. It's fine. It's part of our humanity that this comes into the practice. Not to expect a pure mettā all the time that's completely free of attachment. We can see this in the practice. |
| <span class="blockid">3-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Near enemy of metta is attached love\|Near enemy of metta is attached love]]<br/><hr class="cell">**Rob**: Well, okay. 'Near enemy' is a bit of a strange concept that comes from the Buddha, actually.^[The concept of a 'near enemy' of _mettā_ seems to originate from post-canonical Pali texts. See Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa, _The Path of Purification: Visuddhimagga_, tr. Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli (Onalaska, WA: Pariyatti, 1999), 311] And what it means is something that _looks_ like love, _looks_ like loving-kindness, but isn't. It's pretty close, but it isn't. And the near enemy of _mettā_, of loving-kindness, is _attached love_. Now, we all have experienced that. It's not unconditional love. So _mettā_ in its aspiration is: it doesn't matter what you do, what you give me back, what you say, whether you're grateful, what you've done, whether I like you - none of that. It's unconditional. But usually, there are strings and conditions attached to our love, and it's actually attached love. |  |
| <span class="blockid">3-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Attached love is totall normal and okay\|Attached love is totall normal and okay]]<br/><hr class="cell">This is very important, because what we find when we begin exploring for ourselves what _mettā_ means, what we run into is a lot of this near enemy stuff, a lot of attached love. And the first thing to say is that's totally okay. It's totally normal and okay. |  |
| <span class="blockid">3-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Messiness is the stuff of our humanity\|Messiness is the stuff of our humanity]]<br/><hr class="cell">We practise with the totality of our humanity. That's what we are, and that's what we bring to practice, and that's what we practise with. And as human beings, of course, well, we are human. We are complex. A lot of our relationships and intentions - there's quite a messiness there. And in a way, that messiness is the stuff of our humanity. And so it's important to enlarge the picture of the practice and just include all that. We're going to run into these near enemies. No question about it. | <span class="blockid">2-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Don't judge or push away attachment but rather learn about it\|Don't judge or push away attachment, but rather learn about it]]<br/><hr class="cell">Can we then include our humanity, our complexity, the messiness of - I was going to say _some,_ but actually probably _most_ of our relationships? This is just what it is to be in relationship, all kinds of relationships. There _will_ be attachment coming in. In the mettā practice seeing that near enemy of attachment, you don't want to be, "Oh, no, attachment. I'm doing it wrong," or "Oh," pushing it away or whatever. Actually just to see it. Seeing it, being aware of it is part of the practice and part of the learning process. If we're not familiar with what attachment is, we're not going to learn about _it_, and we're also not going to learn about what _pure_ mettā is. So not to be in too much of a hurry to judge or discard or whatever, and just to see. |
| <span class="blockid">3-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Through the near enemy we learn what pure metta is\|Through the near enemy, we learn what pure metta is]]<br/><hr class="cell">And they're actually part of the practice. So not to see them as, "Oh, I give up," you know, or "Oh, I'm not doing it right." They're actually part of the practice, to encounter attached love, in the meditation, in the walking, as you go about the day, in your interactions with people. It's part of the practice, and actually a necessary part of the practice, because it's through that that we learn about what 'near enemy' is, but we also learn what pure _mettā_ is. Without the near enemies, we could never make that journey of learning. So not to regard it as a kind of failure, or "I'm not getting it right." This is a learning process as much as anything else. And one's beginning to see the different aspects. |  |
| <span class="blockid">3-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#What does it mean to be a good friend in this life\|What does it mean to be a good friend in this life?]]<br/><hr class="cell">So today we introduced the friend, the category of the friend. And so to reflect a little bit - I mean, each of us, I think this is really important in our lives, to reflect: what does it mean to be a friend? What does it mean to be a good friend in this life? And actually, there are a lot of aspects just to that. | <span class="blockid">2-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Category "friend"\|Category "friend"]]<br/><hr class="cell">And we have this category of the friend. And to ask: what is it to be a friend? What is it to be a good friend? And again, sometimes with the mettā, and sometimes for me (and I know I'm not the only one), reading the suttas, we can read about this stuff and it's almost inhuman, it sounds, almost something otherworldly or abstract. Reading the suttas is sometimes a bit like chewing cardboard. It's not that juicy. It doesn't seem to sometimes relate too much to our actual life. What is it to be a good friend? Some of that, to me, is really seeing another, really seeing a friend. We talk about mettā not being attached, but to me, being realistic, being human, to be in a friendship means I also want to be seen. So I see the other, but I am seen. And this is, you know, we can talk about idealized mettā, but in the reality, in the nitty-gritty of our life, we see, hopefully, the other. We give that fullness of seeing. And we want to be seen. Maybe we _need_ to be seen. And we see ourselves as well. We see ourselves. And this is a huge part of what meditation practice is about, just seeing ourselves - whether it's vipassanā or mettā. Seeing ourselves. And we appreciate the other. We appreciate their particular beauty, their particular uniqueness, their particular expression in the world. |
| <span class="blockid">3-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Friendship means to have the aspiration to keep seeing each other\|Friendship means to have the aspiration to keep seeing each other]]<br/><hr class="cell">Part of it is _seeing_ another. Do we _see_ our friend? Do we really _see_ them? Krishnamurti used to talk about this a lot - how easy it is to just habituate oneself to another, especially when we're very familiar or very intimate with them. And we begin almost to not see them freshly. So I would say an aspiration of friendship, or what friendship means, is to have the aspiration to keep seeing another, to keep seeing them, to keep that fresh, open, not to put another in a box. This goes on all the time, in the best of our friendships. It goes on all the time. And it's just a matter of admitting that to ourselves. And again, what does it mean to be a good friend? It means to care about that, and to try and keep breaking that open, and having it be fresh. And that's quite a task. I think it's quite a task. And especially, you know, relationships, friendships, intimate relationships that last years - how easy it is to just gloss over the other with time, with familiarity. |  |
| <span class="blockid">3-7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#It's ok that we also want to be seen by the other\|It's ok that we also want to be seen by the other]]<br/><hr class="cell">So that's part of what friendship means, that aspiration. But this is where our humanity comes in. Also, let's be realistic. If I'm friends with someone, perhaps until we are completely enlightened, completely awakened, I'm also, as much as I want to see the other, I'm going to want to be seen. So that's already attached. You know, there are already some strings attached there. I would say, in the context of a friendship, that's okay. That's part of what it is. |  |
| <span class="blockid">4-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#How am I in this relationship\|How am I in this relationship?]]<br/><hr class="cell">What we've got here is something quite human and complex, and not, perhaps, quite the stainless picture that we might at first see, that might at first seem the case when we come to _mettā_ practice. We want to be seen, and it's a beautiful thing to feel like you are being seen by a friend. And perhaps that's a necessary part of our friendships, and a necessary part of our humanity. How does it feel in a friendship when we don't feel seen? We see the other, we try to see the other, we want to be seen, we need to be seen, and we also need to want to see ourselves. How am I in this relationship? I'm interacting - what's going on for me? What are my intentions? What are my feelings? So we see ourselves, too, and that's equally important. We talk about what is friendship, what makes good friendship. |  |
| <span class="blockid">4-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Do I hold back my voicing of appreciation\|Do I hold back my voicing of appreciation?]]<br/><hr class="cell">We appreciate the other in a friendship. There is appreciation for who they are, for how they are, for what they do, for their manifestation. And hopefully there is the willingness and the ability to express that. And this is something we all need to look into: do I hold back my voicing of appreciation in the relationships that I'm in? How easy it is to get into that pattern, and just a little bit inhibited in doing that. |  |
| <span class="blockid">4-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Am I walling off the appreciation coming from the other\|Am I walling off the appreciation coming from the other?]]<br/><hr class="cell">And conversely, again, we take in appreciation. And again, this is a very interesting one. How many of us - is it actually quite difficult? We have someone who loves us, and they're expressing appreciation, and some wall comes up over the heart, just can't take it in. It just bounces right off. How common this is. And again, to appreciate oneself - all this is part of what friendship is. Or rather, I would say, friendship is the commitment to growing in all of that, and to uncovering all of that, to discovering all of that. | <span class="blockid">3-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Re-parenting ourselves\|Re-parenting ourselves]]<br/><hr class="cell">And for many, to take in appreciation is also quite a big step. Are we open to actually hearing someone express appreciation of how we are, what we are, who we are, how we did something? This is a huge part of mettā, as well, receiving that love. And for many, this is not easy. Are we appreciating other, are we appreciating ourselves, and are we letting in the appreciation of others for ourself? So often, for many of us, these things - seeing, being seen, appreciating, being appreciated - were not actually there that healthily or that fully in the growing up, in the family environment, in the education, in the social environment, etc. And so to me, one way of looking at practice, a big part of it is actually re-parenting ourselves. We're giving to ourselves the kind of attentiveness, the kind of seeing, the kind of appreciation that maybe we didn't quite get as fully as possible when we were younger. Re-parenting, re-gifting ourselves with that. And that can be, you know, one way of looking at it is that can be a very important focus of practice for many years, many years. |
| <span class="blockid">4-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Reparenting ourselves\|Reparenting ourselves]]<br/><hr class="cell">So I think it's fair to say there's a kind of level of practice, or a dimension of practice, that's really about reparenting ourselves. I mean, that's a way of putting it. Sometimes, for some people, literally, the parents did not provide enough of what was needed. And there is, in a way, a very real reparenting that goes on, very gradually, over months and years. And that's one of the functions - not totally, not the complete practice - one of the functions of practice, this reparenting. |  |
| <span class="blockid">4-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#The squeaky clean metta machine\|The squeaky clean metta machine]]<br/><hr class="cell">Sometimes we can hear some of the teachings, or read some of the suttas, and they talk about loving-kindness, and this boundlessness of it and the unconditionality of it. And it can seem a little unreal, or unrealistic. It's a bit too squeaky clean. Like, the image - squeaky clean _mettā_ machine. It somehow doesn't feel very human - _sometimes_, _some_ of the references. And there's a way that it can feel like it excludes or precludes our personality, our self-expression, our uniqueness. So this is really important: it _doesn't_. The manifestations of loving-kindness, the expressions, the intentions of loving-kindness, very much include our particular uniqueness, our particular self-expression. It's very human, very personal. And yesterday night, John talked about _anattā,_ this teaching of not-self, the emptiness of self. And yesterday he approached it via the aggregates, the five aggregates. There are many ways to approach it. | <span class="blockid">3-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Metta being unconditioned and boundless can seem a bit unreal "metta machine"\|Metta being unconditioned and boundless can seem a bit unreal ("metta machine")]]<br/><hr class="cell">As I said, we have this idea, or we hear about mettā, we read about it, maybe in the suttas or whatever, and we get this aspiration: it's boundless. It has no limits. No one, no being is excluded. And it's also unconditional - it does not depend on you saying that you like me or being nice to me or anything like that. It's unconditional. It doesn't even depend on you being that likeable or that nice. It's unconditioned and boundless. And sometimes, as I say, it can seem a bit unreal. We can also get the sense that we're sort of aiming to be these mettā machines, and everyone will, at the end of this three-week retreat, go through the grinder, and emerge as this sort of mettā machine, #1, #2, #3, and all look the same. That somehow in the mettā, in the high aspiration of it, it's going to preclude our personality and our personal, particular expression of mettā, our self-expression in that, our uniqueness. And to me, it doesn't mean that at all, absolutely doesn't. So not to make mettā something unreal in our life. |

We have a sense of _me_, _my_ personality, _my_ individuality. The question, Dharmically, is not that that shouldn't be there, that we shouldn't have a sense of our individuality and our uniqueness. It's rather, is the way that I'm regarding my personality, my uniqueness, my individuality, is the way I'm holding that leading to suffering for me and suffering to others? Am I over-identified? Am I wrapped too tight in my self-definitions, in my self-views, believing, "I'm like this," and needing that affirmed all the time, or too rigid? Am I wrapped up in that self-view? If I am, then it's going to cause problems, for self and for other. | <span class="blockid">3-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Relationship to Anatta\|Relationship to Anatta]]<br/><hr class="cell">I think it was yesterday that John talked about anattā, not-self, and we'll be talking much more about that. And again, this is very important, to really be clear that mettā and certainly anattā are not closing the door on our individuality, on our uniqueness, on our particular self-expression. Actually, rather the opposite. It's more a question of, "Am I attached to my particular individuality, my particular self-expression in a way that's causing suffering for myself or other?" Usually, normal human beings, normal human consciousness, the answer is, "Yes, I am." I'm somehow regarding this particular individual as somehow separate, somehow fixed. A fixed self, a separate self, and an independent self. And if I view my individuality and the whole culture of individuality and what I need and what I want and what my rights are, if I view it from that vantage point of a separate, independent, and fixed self - bound to cause suffering for myself and for others. No question. |

Actually, there are many other ways of looking at it. One is that this - in this case [gesturing to self] - this particular individuality, this particular self-expression, this particular uniqueness, is the result of an infinite web, completely inextricable web of conditions, in the present and reaching far back into the past. So just this body, genetically, from the parents and the whole sort of, you know, millennia, multi-millions, billions of years recess, actually, right back to the Big Bang. And the evolution of matter, and the genetic passing on - this body. And then this body nourished by air, nourished by food, nourished by sunlight. This makes this particular expression of the body, like it or not. | <span class="blockid">4-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#It's an infinite web that has given rise to this appearence\|It's an infinite web that has given rise to this appearence]]<br/><hr class="cell">If I have another view, and I begin to see that this individuality, this uniqueness of self-expression is actually arising from an infinite web of conditions, absolutely unfathomably infinite, mind-blowingly infinite, unentangleable web of conditions. So just the physicality of who _I_ am, in this case: there was the genetic make-up of both my parents, and where that came from, and the infinite regress of that, the sunlight, the food, where all that comes from. So just in the physical being, it's actually an infinite web that has given rise to this appearance, this form right now. And then psychically, psychologically, mentally, emotionally, everything that has influenced in the present or in the past, everything that I've read, everything that I've heard, all the music I've listened to, all the conversations I've had, all the interactions, all the education. All of that. Everything, everything, everything. Every moment of my life has come together in some completely inextricable web to create this, and in some completely unrepeatable way, to create this particular form right now, and including this particular expression right now as I'm talking. |

And there's a way that the self and the very individuality and uniqueness of the self is inextricably bound up with, actually, _everything else_ in the whole universe. We have a delusion of separateness. Can we practise - and this is a really important word, 'practise,' because we can kind of understand this intellectually - can we practise reversing that delusion and actually seeing another way, seeing in terms of this web? So part of what 'practise' means is playing with ways of looking, shaking things up, saying, "Let me look at this another way. Let me practise looking at this another way," until that other way, which brings freedom with it, which brings love with it, becomes much more accessible, much more normal for us. | <span class="blockid">4-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Everything is always embedded in all of life\|Everything is always embedded in all of life]]<br/><hr class="cell">When we see that individuality in that context, then we're completely free to be as unique and individual and expressing ourself in any way, that we feel free to. But it's always embedded in the context of all of life, of the whole universe. It's never divorced from that. It's actually inextricable from that. We can hear that as an intellectual concept and think, "Ah, yeah, that's cute," you know. But it's a whole other thing to begin retraining the mind to see the self that way, to see what we do, what we say, how we interact, to see it in terms of a web of conditions. It takes time. When we begin to see in terms of this infinite web, then it releases the freedom, our freedom to be as individual as we feel, and releases also love because it's bound up with all other beings and everything else. |

What is it that makes them, makes most of humanity, perhaps - it's interesting: for some people, no one is neutral; there's always some kind of tussle.

And what one has then is a very prominent sense of self and a prominent sense of one thing that one's in a bit of a tizzy about. | <span class="blockid">5-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Clinging and the self are mutually dependent\|Clinging and the self are mutually dependent]]<br/><hr class="cell">Can we begin to see - and this is, in a way, a really crucial investigation in our life, and it takes some time to see it: when the self-sense is strong, when the self is strong and built up, clinging is strong, and we're clinging to something. And that clinging is actually building up the self, and the self is building up the clinging. Self and clinging build each other. They're co-dependent. They're mutually dependent. When self is strong, some other thing is strong - some _thing_ that's happening, maybe some other person in our interaction with them, maybe something in our body, in our mind, something in the environment. Something is strong, and self is strong, and they go together, bound by the clinging. Clinging is strong, self is strong; self is strong, clinging is strong. |

This is another way of saying self is empty. It depends on our clinging. It depends on us struggling with something in some way. The more we struggle, the more built up the self is. And you have the self, and you have _one thing_ with which one is clinging or grasping to some degree, and everything else, every_one_ else, just fades: "Not interested right now." You've got the self and this thing, feeding each other - the more thing, the more self; the more self, the more thing. Clinging is building that process. Everyone else fades to grey: "Not interested." We really need to see this. We need to see this process. What's happening? How is it that self gets built up, a thing gets built up, and everyone else can kind of go to ...?

And to really begin to notice this, and to really look into this in our life. How is it that we exclude, that we put others in the background? Now, obviously some people are more in our everyday life. But something's going on here about clinging and self. And to really look at that and investigate it until it's very clear. It's also another way of looking at seeing what we call the emptiness of self. Self depends on our clinging to something, on our struggling with something inner or outer. The more we struggle, the more we cling, the more self is built up. Self by itself is empty. It needs that clinging, that struggle. This is something that, spiritually speaking, we really need to understand. We need to be completely in ourselves clear about this. And it takes time. |

Are we able to do that? First of all, are we _able_ to do that? Are we _willing_ to do that? Are we able to do it skilfully? These are, you know, hard challenges for us. | <span class="blockid">6-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#"No" in the context of metta\|"No" in the context of metta]]<br/><hr class="cell">So there's the benefactor, and the friend, and the neutral. And sometimes, as I said, the friend or the benefactor, there can be some difficulty, and they find themselves in the difficult category. Well, they probably don't know it, but whatever. They're in the difficult category at times. So I also feel very strongly that an important part of what we might call the realistic expression of mettā is working with the difficult with love. In other words, actually expressing anger, expressing a "no" when we need to in a situation: "No, actually that's not okay. No, that was overstepping a boundary," whatever it is. That kind of strength of "no," in the context of love, in the context of mettā. So mettā is actually a strong thing, it's not some namby-pamby Pollyannaish thing. It doesn't mean being a doormat. It doesn't mean that everyone's then going to step over us, and we don't care, and everyone just treats us like a doormat. Sometimes we end up acting that way, a bit like a doormat, because of fear, fear of actually expressing anger, fear of saying that "no," inability of setting boundaries. This is really common. |

I have a very good friend. She suffers from quite severe depression at times. And she's beginning to notice this relationship - it's only part of what goes on for her, and depression itself is quite complex, so it's only a strand. But she's beginning to notice that there are times when something happens with someone, and she's angry. Something goes on that she's really angry about, and she feels so fearful of expressing the anger. She's just beginning to be aware of this now: she turns it in on herself. The next thing she knows, she's in a state of depression (which is one of the possibilities of what can happen here). And in her case, it's doubly tragic because, I feel that she's someone with a very natural, very naturally, very deep _mettā_ and compassion. And every time this happens, the depression comes on, it just closes down her ability to express that and to offer that to others and to herself. | <span class="blockid">6-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Anger turned inside ending up in depression\|Anger turned inside, ending up in depression]]<br/><hr class="cell">I have a very good friend who's suffered for many years, suffers from depression.

And she's beginning to see what she does with it: she turns it inside and kind of attacks the anger, starts to attack herself, and it ends up in depression. She's beginning to see that. And in so doing, it's actually closing her love. The depression actually closes what, in her case, is quite an extraordinary capacity to love. It just closes that. |

If we're into meditation and all that: "It's bad. No anger, no expression of it." Or we may be into certain kinds of psychotherapy that are all about letting it out, and venting it, and expressing it, and the catharsis of that. But just not so quick to conclude. It's, to me, a very tricky area. It's definitely true to say that there's too much anger in the world. There's too much violence, hatred, ill-will, anger. We just have to open a newspaper to see that. Just have to go into a lot of high streets to see that. So anger is complicated, and it's interesting. |

So I'm talking now about investigating anger and expressing anger as actually one of the faces of loving-kindness - _can_ be, can be. Anger is interesting. When we really look at it, and when we're really honest with it, it's usually blind, and it's usually blind in three ways. |  |

So usually something happens, we get angry, and we say, "_You_ are making me angry," or "_This_ is making me angry." And what we don't see in that - it seems so obvious; what we don't see is the whole inner constellation, or both inner and outer constellation of conditions that allow the anger to be. All kinds of assumptions, perceptions, views, thoughts. What was the state of mind before the anger? Perhaps there was a little bit of irritability and leaning that way anyway. Anger comes, and it becomes blind to its causes, and wants to put it on one thing. Dharma practice means to uncover that. Blind to its causes. | <span class="blockid">6-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#With anger we often don't see the wider web of conditions\|With anger we often don't see the wider web of conditions]]<br/><hr class="cell">Oftentimes anger is blind in a number of ways. It's blind to its causes. So something happens, and we tend to think, we feel angry, we tend to think, "_You_ did that wrong. _You_ are making me angry," or whatever. We don't see the wider, again, the wider web of conditions. I needed to be seeing the situation in a certain way. I needed to be in a certain mood. I needed a whole host of inner and outer factors to be there for the anger to come. A lot of them are inner in the way we have been, in the moments preceding that, predisposed to seeing or assuming or perceiving or holding a situation. And all that, that crucible of conditions, are the causes of anger. But we tend to just isolate one thing: "No, _you_," or sometimes "I," or whatever. |

Oftentimes when we have anger it's kind of like a heat, a pressure inside that just wants to kind of burst out and burst forth, and we want to express it and get it out. |

I was a very keen client [laughter], and so off I went to the gym, and this huge punch-bag. I was pummelling this thing. I connected with anger, pummelling this punch-bag, and what I noticed was, I would do it and I would get more angry. And just start pummelling it more, and anger would build.

There's something going on here that's actually - what feels like it should be a letting out, an expression, a release, is actually building. There's something going on. It's building the anger. At first I thought, "Oh, now I'm connecting at deeper levels of it. Now it's really coming up." But after a while it was … [laughter] I was very young! After a while, it just became clear: no, this is building it. There's something going on here that's actually building it. |
| <span class="blockid">8-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Anger\|Anger]]<br/><hr class="cell">Anger can be blind to its effects. What's going on? We tend to think, "There's such a pressure inside. It needs to release. I need to get it out. It's like a heat, a burning. Get it out! And then, when I get it out I'll feel better." Even if we don't consciously think that, is that the case, always? It can be blind to its effects. |  |
| <span class="blockid">8-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#It can also be blind to its effects on others\|It can also be blind to its effects on others]]<br/><hr class="cell">It can also be blind to its effects on others. So again, we say, we _voice_ our anger, we _vent_ our anger at someone. And really what we want is for the situation to change, or part of what we want. And yet, I think it takes an extraordinarily evolved human being to have anger flung at them, energetically, that level of anger, and not to react. Just energetically, it's such a strong energy. We human beings, we're very sensitive, very vulnerable, fragile beings, energetically. Someone, "_Bleurgh!_" _-_ it takes a _very_ evolved person, practising _very hard_ ... [laughter] to just hear that and say, you know, no reaction, "I hear," you know, and just to respond, and not react. Anger can be blind to its effects on others. |  |
| <span class="blockid">8-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Blind to itself\|Blind to itself]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(3) Blind to itself**, as well, the third blindness. Anger often - it feels like it's so clear, that we're just striking through things with the wisdom sword of Mañjuśrī: we're seeing _exactly_ what's happening! The Buddha likened the angry mind to water that's boiling.^[SN 46:55] You actually can't see anything underneath. It's just raging away. | <span class="blockid">7-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Anger can also be blind to itself\|Anger can also be blind to itself]]<br/><hr class="cell">So anger can have this blindness to its effects - on ourselves, we think it's going to release, it's going to let something go, and also on others, on the effect it has on others. And anger can also be blind to itself. It tends to view itself as, when we're sitting with anger, "I see a completely clear vision of something. Here I am with Mañjuśrī's sword of wisdom, and I'm cutting through with my anger." And it's actually completely clouded with all kinds of things. But it has a _feeling_ that it's clear. |
| <span class="blockid">8-7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Explore these blindnesses\|Explore these blindnesses]]<br/><hr class="cell">So part of practice is to really be honest about this, and about these blindnesses, and explore them. Oftentimes, when we feel anger, it feels a lot easier to vent it. And it might feel easier in the moment. But in the long run, it's not. It's really not. What am I building when I vent anger? What am I crystallizing and conditioning in myself, and in the relationship, and in others? Again, this is one of these quite complex issues, so I just want to, in a way, open it up. | <span class="blockid">7-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#With regard to anger keep investigating\|With regard to anger, keep investigating]]<br/><hr class="cell">I'm going to talk a bit more about anger, but it's very complicated, so I don't want to say one thing or the other. I just feel like, for me, it's an ongoing exploration with anger. I've seen there've been times when I've been in this camp, times when I've been in this view. And in a way, I feel maybe for me right now the wisest thing is not to settle so much on "This is how it is, and this is not how it is," and just to keep the creativity and the questioning open with that. |
| <span class="blockid">9-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Is it possible to express anger skilfully\|Is it possible to express anger skilfully?]]<br/><hr class="cell">Is it possible to feel anger, to feel the anger, and to express it in a way that the person does not feel dumped on, vomited on, flung at? Some of you may be familiar with, just to say, "I feel angry." It's very different from just ranting at someone. One is taking ownership instead of hurling or dumping the feelings on another. Big difference in effect. Now, that's not easy. And there's no way that I think anyone realistically would say that's easy. It's very challenging. | <span class="blockid">7-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#When anger is thrown at us it's difficult to not automatically go into reactive mode\|When anger is thrown at us, it's difficult to not automatically go into reactive mode]]<br/><hr class="cell">When we express or when anger is expressed very uncensoredly from one to another, I feel as human beings we are enormously sensitive and vulnerable; we are fragile creatures, our hearts are fragile, our very physicality is fragile, our energetics are fragile. When anger is thrown at us, it's extremely difficult not to just react to that anger, not to just automatically go into a reactive mode. Someone yells, and we just immediately go into that, and it just builds. To me, I think it takes quite an evolved being to hear, you know, have that torrent of anger come at them, not automatically go into reactive mode, be very spacious, distil the truth of what's being said, and respond appropriately. Would be a very evolved being working very hard, as far as I can tell. [laughter] So when we fling anger, that's part of what the blindness is to its effects: we expect, "Well, I just want this to change." We're adding a whole load of other stuff. It's very difficult to hear anger and stay open, and spacious, and responsive, and loving. |

It feels like there's pressure that wants to come out. It's just easier to vent it, easier to just _bleurgh._ But in the long run, what are we building there? What are we building? We're building the habit of that. We're building the habit of not caring how it lands, how it affects. We're building the pathways of anger, all of that. In the long run, it's not easier. In terms of our relationships, it's not easier. |
| <span class="blockid">9-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Of all the five precepts it's the hardest one\|Of all the five precepts, it's the hardest one]]<br/><hr class="cell">This whole area of communication, and particularly communicating what's difficult in our relationships - how much of the difficulty we have in relationships is around our lack of skill and care and consciousness around communication? Such a huge area, and we can easily have a whole Dharma talk, a whole day, just on that. And just a little piece - the Buddha said when there's something difficult to communicate to another, that one speaks what is true, _if it's helpful_.^[MN 58] In other words, if you feel that the person can really hear it, and can learn from it, what's true and helpful, in a helpful way, skilfully - and this is a practice - what's true and helpful, in a helpful way, at the right time. [laughs] So that's _quite_ a ... [laughs] I think it's just a practice. It's really a practice, and of all the precepts, all the five precepts, it's the hardest one. It's such an art, such a skill. And in a way, to learn to hold back and to do it in the right way, in a helpful way. | <span class="blockid">8-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Practice not dumping anger on the other person\|Practice not dumping anger on the other person]]<br/><hr class="cell">So a real practice in life, I feel, is to - I'm not saying not to _feel_ anger, because for most of us in this room that would be just a bit ridiculous, a step too far. What is it to feel anger and to say, "I feel angry"? Not to throw that, not to hurl it or dump it on another person. It's a whole different thing. I don't think that's easy at all, not at all. And it's a real practice. The Buddha talks about the communication of what is difficult. He talks about speaking what's true and what's helpful, in a helpful way, at the right time. It's quite a lot there! [laughter] To reflect on, "Okay, I feel angry. Breathe. How am I going to …? What's the best way?" That can take time, just to let it calm down a little bit, and then assess: what's going to be best here? It's really a practice, not easy at all. And we learn this as a practice. We're going to make mistakes, absolutely. There's no question that we're going to make mistakes in this area. Absolutely no question. |
| <span class="blockid">9-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Story it's a learning process\|Story: it's a learning process]]<br/><hr class="cell">I think, and I know for myself, and I see it in others, that this is really a learning process. Again, that word 'practice' - it's a practice. It's going to take time. So if I think back, for myself, again, going back twenty years or more, I wasn't even _aware_ of when I felt angry. And then, didn't connect with it. And then, afraid or unable to communicate that to others. And then, learnt, gradually, willing to try and do that, but went way over the other side. So I basically dropped, you know, small thermonuclear devices on people, _really_ going overboard. It was part of the learning process. Luckily I could say sorry in a lot of cases, but it actually fractured a lot of relationships. And again, it was coming out of, in a way, wanting to be earnest, and wanting to address what was actually an imbalance in myself, and wanting to be honest, and wanting to stand in the truth. And yet it was so difficult to do that in a way that was balanced. So we're going to make mistakes, and I think that's okay. Or we neglect to say something when we actually should have. | <span class="blockid">8-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#If we make mistakes in that practice a "sorry" goes a long way\|If we make mistakes in that practice, a "sorry" goes a long way]]<br/><hr class="cell">For me, my history, my whatever reasons, upbringing or whatever, I had a very strong tendency to not express anger. Certainly not express that "no," not be able to express a "no." Oftentimes not even to be in contact with a feeling of anger when I felt it. So I'd be completely purple in the face or whatever, and "_No, everything's fine_!" [laughter] And that was my particular leaning. And then, through practice and therapy and all this, learnt how to say "no." And for the first period, which to be honest was actually a few years, I would basically bite people's heads off, completely nuke them. Went really to the other extreme in the way I said "no," and it caused a lot of fracturing in a lot of my friendships and relationships and family and stuff. Thankfully, you know, I healed it, but. I had a tendency to be a little extreme, anyway. The point is that we're going to make mistakes with this, and we're either going to go to one extreme or the other, and it's fine. It's really fine. If we _do_ make mistakes, a "sorry" goes a long way, a long, long way, a genuine "sorry." And just to expect the mistakes and the moving back and forth as we learn. And I don't see any way other than that it takes years to learn this. And as I said, even then it's an evolving thing. There's no place we come to: "Right, that's it!" |
| <span class="blockid">9-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#"My intention is not to hurt"\|"My intention is not to hurt"]]<br/><hr class="cell">A while ago - can't remember when it was - I had a situation that went on with someone, and I felt quite upset by what was going on. I can't actually remember what it was now! But anyway ... [laughter] And I remember asking to speak with this person, and the first thing I said when I went in to speak with her was, "I really want you to know my intention is not to hurt. I really don't want to hurt in what I'm saying, and I don't want to retaliate. It may be that what I'm saying doesn't come out perfectly. I still feel agitated and upset a little bit, and I don't know if I can say it perfectly, so please just bear that in mind and excuse that.

And I sat with it for a while, and was with it, and met with this person. I remember saying right from the bat, right from the first thing, "I want to talk about something difficult. I'm upset." And I said, "Please, please know my intention is not to retaliate. I don't want to hurt. My intention is not to hurt. I'm still feeling a bit upset. I'm still feeling quite upset, and confused a little bit, not so clear. So maybe I won't express it so clearly, so perfectly, because of the agitation and the hurt." And I felt like that was very helpful. It kind of set something up in this interaction. First of all, it set up the humanity of it, and secondly it set up something about allowing me to then express what it was, what I was troubled by, in a non-perfect way; I didn't have to do it perfectly. And I hope that it also allowed the other person to then be not perfect. So we could be human together. |
| <span class="blockid">9-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Setting up a context of non-harming\|Setting up a context of non-harming]]<br/><hr class="cell">And in a way, I felt that was really helpful, just first thing, saying that, setting up, setting up a kind of context of non-harming, setting up the intention - setting up also the humanity of it, so I could be human, I could be less than perfect, which actually also invited her, or allowed her, to be less than perfect, to be human. And that was something, it felt very, very helpful to do that at the time. Now, of course, if one does something like that, you have to make sure that you really don't have an intention to hurt. You can't just go in there saying, "Yeah, I don't intend to hurt," and then, you know, you've got your ... [laughter] | <span class="blockid">8-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#The intention not to retaliate has to be real\|The intention not to retaliate has to be real]]<br/><hr class="cell">Now, of course, that intention not to retaliate, not to hurt has to be real. You can't go in there and say, "Yeah, I don't want to …" [laughter] And actually you've kind of got a gun there. So to take the time with this, to really calm, and find that place where genuinely we can say, "Okay, I'm still upset, I'm still hurt, I'm still confused, I'm still angry, but I really, really, really am clear in myself: I have no wish to hurt, no ill-will, no wish to be right, to retaliate, any of that." |

And then we're much more ready to have that conversation. All this is very challenging. |  |
| <span class="blockid">10-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Story "yeah give it to me"\|Story: "yeah, give it to me"]]<br/><hr class="cell">Sometimes we find ourselves in relationship on the receiving end of anger. Someone is angry at us for what we've done or not done, whatever it is. And then it's a whole skill to hear anger. And this is very interesting too. Again, if I think back, I used to be a person, when people were angry with me - again, and I feel, looking back, and I'm sure many others share this, it was coming out of a kind of earnestness, you know, and really wanting to look at my faults and see where I could grow and open and transform. So someone was angry at me, and would hurl that anger, or would just go - you know, back in the eighties, when it was really ... you know, that was the way to do it. [laughter] At least in America it was. [laughter] And what I would do, out of earnestness, was completely open up, energetically: "Yeah, give it to me." [laughter] Because I really wanted to be totally honest and totally open and totally take in what was being said. Maybe I could learn something about myself. Maybe there really was something that I needed to be honest about, and get to the bottom of, and transform. | <br/><hr class="cell"><span style="color:red">also</span> [[0125 Expressions of Metta#After a "yeah give it to me" can take weeks to recover energetically\|After a "yeah, give it to me" can take weeks to recover energetically]] |

I mean, energetically, in some instances, I remember, it would take weeks to recover. I mean, it was so strong, the energetic effect. And then I remember a teacher, Michael, at - I can't remember what it was - a day retreat or an evening class or something, and he said, "You know, we're not obliged to take on or open ourselves to, or even stick around for, someone's energy of rage, energy of anger." And I heard that, and my jaw hung. It seemed completely radical to me. And what he was saying was, you could say to a person, "I really see that you're angry, and I really want to hear what it is that you're upset about, and I really want to hear what's going on. But I'm not prepared to take on that energy. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to open myself to that. So when you feel able to just tell me that in a way that's more calm, then I'm ready to listen. So maybe, you know, go for a walk or whatever." | <span class="blockid">9-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#We are not obliged to bear anyone else's angry energy\|We are not obliged to bear anyone else's angry energy]]<br/><hr class="cell">So anger in the context of love, anger in the context of mettā. Sometimes we find ourselves with - someone we love is angry at us. And we find ourselves having to hear the anger. So again, this is quite interesting. I remember being in a meditation class in America when I lived there, and one of the teachers saying, "You know, we're not obliged to take in, to kind of bear anyone else's angry energy. There's no obligation to do that. And you can say to a person, 'I really want to hear what you're saying, but I'm not going to do that when you're in that much anger, when you're ranting and yelling or whatever it is. So if you want to go for a walk and calm down and whatever, and then I'll hear you.'" Of course, then they'll probably be [angry at that suggestion]. |

[laughter] And of course I was completely bowled over by this, I mean really, really bowled over. And it would take me, in some instances, days or weeks to recover energetically. And I think sometimes it just goes with a certain kind of earnestness, really, and sort of genuine openness of heart. |

And again, I'm sure I'm not alone in that pattern, so I'm voicing it. But I'm sure I'm not alone in that pattern of, out of earnestness, opening oneself up to that. Do we open ourselves up to listening to what the person has to say? Yes. The energy, the rage, that violence? Why? |  |
| <span class="blockid">10-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#[Anger\|[Anger]]<br/><hr class="cell">] often comes, a person is often angry, people, individuals, political groups, socio-economic groups, ethnic groups, often angry because they feel unheard. How much at the root of anger is a feeling of being unheard - and a feeling, from that, of powerlessness? A person's not hearing, and I can't do anything about it. Feeling of frustration with that, feeling of hurt, that we feel hurt, and it's not being heard.

I'm not obliged to do that. But I want hear what you have to say. I want to hear your hurt." _That_ piece is crucial, because often that's the piece that's missing, and that's the piece that allows anger to escalate - that people, we or another person feels unheard. That's where the anger comes in, or can escalate, at least. And you see this in individuals. You see this in groups of people, in terrorism and all that. In a way, terrorism, you know, you could say part of it is just this trying to break through with violence to try and be heard. A group of people or whatever - I mean, obviously it's much more complicated than that, but a group of people or whatever feels completely unseen in the whole progress of globalization or whatever, disenfranchised, etc., and "I will be heard."

But in a situation like that, when one person can say to the other, can look and see the hurt that's underneath the anger, and then express to the other person _genuine_ feeling: "It really pains me. I feel sad that I hurt you." And there's something going underneath just this clashing at the surface. In a way, when two people are like that, someone has to do that. Someone has to be the one that takes the risk and is vulnerable, and expresses that and softens. Someone has to show their hurt. Not easy, but if that doesn't happen - well, we all know it just keeps battering at that same level. Somehow to say to someone: "I'm really ... It pains me that I hurt you." | <span class="blockid">9-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Someone at some point has to soften\|Someone at some point has to soften]]<br/><hr class="cell">When we feel unheard, there's a kind of powerlessness. There's a frustration and a hurt there. And it's that hurt that's not being heard, and the frustration and the powerlessness, and a want to break through that. So a gift to another person is to really hear their hurt, to offer that. So for me, in relationships when there's been this kind of thing, what's been really healing is when I've been able to see that hurt in another, and actually just the heart then sees the hurt and connects with it, and there can be just the love there. The recognition, "Oh, I hurt you," and a genuine "It really pains me that I hurt you. I see your hurt. I see how I was a cause in that, and it really hurts me that I hurt you." And there's a genuine sorrow there. So someone, and you know we've all been in this, there are just two hardnesses, two angers bumping up against each other. Someone at some point has to soften, let go, be vulnerable. Otherwise it just keeps bumping. And we've all been there. Okay, anger. That was anger in the context of mettā. |

So you may want to explore this a bit. I feel this is a very important aspect of _mettā_.

So how we are walking, how we're opening and closing doors, how we're handling the dishes and the cutlery, how we're eating.

[laughter] What would it be to actually begin to explore - it's just an option - explore touching the body with tenderness? What is it? One hand touches the other hand, and through the hand, in the touch, through the touch, there is tenderness there. You can actually feel it. And one part of the body is expressing to the other tenderness. Hand on the arm, hand on the chest, hand on the belly - just feel into that, and imagine it, and just feel the tenderness moving through the body. Play with it as a practice if you want to. I feel it's very important. Or we're standing outside or doing the walking meditation outside. And again, some of this you may have uncovered anyway. Walking, walking meditation, and the foot touches the earth, and actually, there can be a kiss there. There can be love, somehow felt, tenderness, beauty felt, between foot and earth.

And feel, allow, a tenderness of touch to flow through, in this case from one hand to the other hand, one hand to the arm, whatever. And you know, you may be a little shy about this, or it's a bit weird or whatever, but if you want to experiment with this, what is it to let the body and the hands really exude that and feel that? So if you want to, maybe in your room or whatever, just quietly. What is it to touch the body with tenderness and to feel that? |

What is it to walk, a human being walking on the earth, and the feet touch the earth, and in that contact, the sensations between the foot and the earth, there's love there? There's somehow love in the contact, in the mystery of what it is to be a human being with the foot touching the earth, walking on the earth. Somehow there's love. And to explore.

What are the ways that the _mettā_ can open up and flow through the body, through the eyes? And there are ways of looking that are imbued with loving-kindness. And in a way, attention and love go very closely together. How often is it that someone needing love, they come to us, and what they really need is our attention and the fullness of our attention, the softness of our attention? And through that very attention, that's actually all they need. They need to be heard, need to be seen, need to be held in that attention. The looking itself expresses the love, carries the love. And can be with each other here, can be with nature, trees, to look at a tree with that - what is it? Play with this, possibly, if you want. | <span class="blockid">10-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Express love as attentiveness via the eyes\|Express love as attentiveness via the eyes]]<br/><hr class="cell">Love as expressed through the eyes as attentiveness. To really look. To really look at another, at something in nature, ourselves in the mirror. So oftentimes in relationship we express love as attentiveness. And what a person needs often is attentiveness, the kindness of our attention. That's what we can offer others. So attentiveness as mettā. |

Nothing to hurry for here. To really slow down. In a way, that slowing down can also open up this tenderness that flows through the body. So stomping down the corridor, slamming doors, and clunking cutlery - you know, of course it's all fine. There's no problem with any of that. But can there actually be, through all these little movements, little interactions, there is actually the tenderness running through? Experiment with it. Touch the handle of a door. There's somehow the tenderness flowing through that - can be. |  |

So I know if I go to Newton Abbot, and - I'm not saying anything about Newton Abbot. If I go to Newton Abbot and I've got an agenda of things to do, a list, and I've got a limited amount of time, and I'm hurrying through the high street - got to go to the bank, got to go to the chemist, whatever - and somehow, in the very hurrying, the leaning forward, and I'm going through Newton Abbot with my little summary of _what I want_ sort of on the sheet of paper, and that very _what I want_ - basically, clinging encapsulated on a piece of paper ...

I need to go to the bank, I need to - I don't know, buy groceries - and I need to go to make an appointment at the doctor, whatever. I've just got this list, and I'm on the high street, in London or Boston where I lived, or Newton Abbot or wherever it is. There I am, and I'm on the high street with the agenda of _what I want_, basically, in the humble form of this list. But basically it's _what I want_. What happens? What happens then? |

What happens when you're moving in the hustle, the bustle, the busyness of Newton Abbot high street, wherever it is ... and you just drop that? Possibility for a wider sense of mystery of being to come in, and in that, a wider sense of love. And one sees: it's life going on. It's life expressing itself. And children moving, and old people, and interactions with shopkeepers, and business transactions, and - it's all just expressing itself. And dogs, and whatever it is - life expressing itself.

We have _what I want._ We're moving towards something, and there's stuff in the way, and some of that stuff happens to be human beings! [laughter] We don't even realize that this is going on most of the time. What happens? The consciousness shrinks. What is it - and you can really experiment with this - what is it to be slow, not be in a hurry, be on the high street without the agenda of _what I want_?

Too tight in the _what I want_, and what's the downside? Irritability. Someone just breathes a little bit too loudly next to you, and there is irritability there. Or the radiator makes a noise, or whatever it is. Heart's closing.

And it's all going on. There's a widening of the perception instead of that tunnel vision again. You can be on the high street, and this sense of boundless love and all that, it's not just going to be constricted to the retreat and the careful conditions of a retreat. When we drop _what I want_, the heart opens in a very different way, has a very different sense of life and the mystery of life. So when there's _what I want_ and we're caught up in that, we close the doors to the mystery. And it's right there, believe it or not, in Newton Abbot, if any of you know Newton Abbot.

And through relaxing that, it's possible that a stillness comes gradually into the being, just gradually into the being. And the body, the being, in a very unforced way, begins to feel more and more still - very non-linear. And also a silence inside, and the outer silence, can begin to become more prominent. | <span class="blockid">11-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Dropping _what I want_ brings into the being a kind of stillness\|Dropping _what I want_ brings into the being a kind of stillness]]<br/><hr class="cell">When we slow down, slow the hurrying, drop a little bit _what I want_ (and especially on retreat we can see this), there can come into the being a kind of stillness, a stilling of the being at a very deep level. Unforced stillness just organically comes into the being, this stillness. It can. In that, a sense of silence - and I talked a bit about this in the opening talk - a sense of silence can actually begin to stand out, to have a prominence. This sense of silence and all that that brings with it, the beauty of that. |
| <span class="blockid">12-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Priorities get much clearer\|Priorities get much clearer]]<br/><hr class="cell">As there's more stillness in the being, and more silence, a couple of things, a number of things can happen. One of them is that our sense of priority gets much clearer. So the usual stuff that we're caught up in as feeling very important in our everyday bustle begins to just settle. And what's most important, what's most deeply important to us - which may be the absolute necessity of love, the wish to surrender to loving-kindness, to open in compassion - what's deeply important to us comes more and more to the fore, becomes prominent in consciousness. It's something that comes out of the stillness and silence. | <span class="blockid">11-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Flotsam and jetsam can just settle\|Flotsam and jetsam can just settle]]<br/><hr class="cell">I touched on this, again, in the opening talk, just briefly: one of the things [about] this sense of silence, as it begins to stand out, begins to emerge, is it allows what's really important to the heart, what's deeply important to rise to the surface. And all the kind of little really flotsam and jetsam, all the trivia that we're so preoccupied with, that can kind of just settle. And what we really, what the heart really cares about in this life can begin to come up and be clear. And our priorities are clear and in place and accessible. That's a huge gift of silence. |
| <span class="blockid">12-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Regreat pain guilt can come to the surface\|Regreat, pain, guilt can come to the surface]]<br/><hr class="cell">Another thing, another aspect that can come up, in a way because of the stillness and the silence, but also because of the _mettā_, is memories of things that we've done or not done, that we regret. And with that - we remember we said this, we did this, we didn't, whatever it was - and the pain of the memory. How easily that can move into guilt, and just wrapped around, repeating the memory and the pain of that. This is a natural part, I think, of doing a _mettā_ retreat, and also of just being in silence for a while. It will allow this stuff to come to the surface.{INDEX: guilt, shame} | <span class="blockid">11-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Guilt and remorse\|Guilt and remorse]]<br/><hr class="cell">Related is something else, and especially silence, especially in the context of a mettā retreat: just automatically, memories come up of things that we did, that we wished that we didn't. Or something we said that we wished that we didn't, or didn't say that we wished that we had. So this is a very common possibility of the softening of the mettā and the silence. I view remorse as something very much a part of the mettā practice and the silence and the retreat. Just remembering and allowing that, remorse being different from what guilt is. I don't know if this is correct English, but guilt, I would say, is when the self has got wrapped around something: "I did that wrong. I am a terrible person. I'm unkind. I, I, I, I, I. You, you, you, you, you. I, I, I." Self has wrapped itself around. Remorse is something much more soft, much more open, much more creative: "Oh, that's what I did. That's what I neglected to do. I feel the pain of that. I feel the sadness of that," but it's open. Not so much self. It's just saying something not so much about _me_, but about _behaviour_. If that situation arises in the future, I'm very clear I want to do it differently now. And so the sadness is part of realigning the intentions of the being. So that kind of remorse, that kind of sadness, can be a really important part of, at times, of the mettā practice and the silence. |
| <span class="blockid">12-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Guild vs remorse\|Guild vs remorse]]<br/><hr class="cell">A distinction between guilt and remorse. I don't know if these are dictionary definitions, but guilt, I would say, is when we remember something, we don't feel good about it, and the self defines itself around it. It's making a conclusion about what we did - making a conclusion about the self, rather. We did this, or we didn't do this, and it's saying, "Therefore I am bad." Do you understand? Are we still here ...? [laughter] Guilt is making a conclusion about the self. Remorse, I would say, is making a conclusion about the action. So guilt has a way of making definitions and binding oneself in a definition of the self: "I'm bad. I'm useless. I'm a failure. I'm not a good person." Remorse is saying, "In the future, I would rather not act that way. I want to choose something different." It's saying something about the action. It's forward-looking, creative, open, whereas guilt is backward-looking and just stays around the self. |  |

The actual sense of silence - so-called 'inner' and so-called 'outer' - begins to become more and more prominent, _can_ begin to come more prominent. And it's almost as if the silence takes on a fabric of itself, a meaning of itself. Almost a mystical sense of silence can open up. That can have everything to do with love.

There's a poem about this by Pablo Neruda. Again, some of you might know it. It's a very beautiful poem about this mystical quality of silence and its relationship to love. It's called "Keeping Quiet."^[Pablo Neruda, _Extravagaria: A Bilingual Edition_, tr. Alastair Reid (London: Jonathan Cape, 1972), 27-9.

Usual human consciousness is preoccupied with things, events, things that happen inside or outside. And that can begin to just die down a little bit, and there's a sense of something _other_ in and through the silence - _can_ be, for some people. | <span class="blockid">11-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#The silence begins to stand out embrace everything\|The silence begins to stand out, embrace everything]]<br/><hr class="cell">So it's possible, one of the possibilities is for this sense of silence to really become strong and really have a very deep effect. In the silence, what happens is the silence begins to embrace everything, be a backdrop for everything, hold everything. The silence begins to stand out, and we begin to let go of our preoccupation with things, with objects, which is the normal preoccupation of consciousness, with things and with objects. That begins to go a little bit into the background. We let go of that preoccupation, and it's almost like some other sense, this sense that Neruda is talking about, some other sense can begin to come to the fore, and make its impact on the heart. |

This silence that seems to permeate the universe has love in it. Everything, our being, everything that comes up is held in that, held in that love. So usually, when we do the _mettā_, we have a sense of _me_ doing it. There's self, and there's effort involved, and the phrases, and we're creating this _mettā_. But again, talking about aspects of _mettā_, facets of _mettā_, it's not always like that. And there are other ways that it can reveal itself. And so, for some people, the whole way that we're going about it, with phrases, etc., is not the way that's most helpful. For some people, a much more devotional practice, using Green Tārā, Kuan Yin (the bodhisattva of compassion, Avalokiteśvara), Jesus - beings, archetypal beings of great love - tuning into them, devoting oneself to them, and receiving, in a way, the love that way. It's not always that _mettā_ feels it's coming from the self. | <span class="blockid">12-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Love as I kind of holding\|Love as I kind of holding]]<br/><hr class="cell">That possibility also opens the door to a possibility of this sense of the _being_ being in the space of silence, and in a way, receiving love. That space, that silence holds everything. Everything arises and passes in that silence, in that space. And we begin to get a whole other sense of love, a whole other sense, as love as a kind of holding, as a kind of receiving, that we ourselves are held and received. All things, all beings are held and received in that silence, in that love. |

But actually there are tons of ways of doing mettā. So very fruitful for some people is having a figure like Jesus or Kuan Yin, the bodhisattva of compassion, Avalokiteśvara, some figure that completely embodies love, and one is just reminded of that and tuning into that energy, and allowing that to radiate and permeate from that being. Or there can be this sense of silence and letting go into the silence. It actually doesn't really matter too much. But the mettā, especially in these other ways, if you have a kind of bodhisattva figure or the silence or something like that, it begins to give a sense of the self not always _doing_ the mettā, that the mettā is self-created, it's always self-created, coming from effort. There can be a sense that, in a way, something is unveiled, something that's woven into the fabric of the universe: love. In a way, some veil is lifted, and we begin to get a sense that somehow it's there all the time. |

That's actually much more significant that it seems at first - much, much more significant. |  |

There's the warmth or whatever it is there, and we feel that. And sometimes that feeling actually becomes relatively steady. And then we can let the phrases go, if that feels helpful - could just let the phrases go and be with that feeling, and just give ourselves to that feeling and enjoy and open to it, and feel into the texture of it, and radiate it. And let the phrases go. | <span class="blockid">13-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Experiment with letting the phrases go\|Experiment with letting the phrases go]]<br/><hr class="cell">So we go back to the phrases for a second. Sometimes with the phrases, as I said, sometimes there's no feeling of mettā there, and we're just patiently, steadily working away, grinding away at the phrases. Sometimes there _is_ a feeling of mettā. And then the feeling of mettā, whatever it is, warmth or pleasantness or openness, sometimes it's there and it's quite steady, and then you might want to experiment with letting the phrases go, or let them get very light, and maybe let them go, and just be with the steadiness of that feeling. Now we have the friend and the benefactor. Sometimes it's possible that we are giving mettā to the friend or the benefactor, to another, and there's the sense of them, and the mettā deepens, the samādhi deepens, and even the visual sense of them kind of fades a little bit, and there's just a sense of a heart radiating mettā to another heart. Just a heart to a heart. |

And we may be directing the love towards the friend or whoever it is, the neutral, the benefactor. And it seems at first that there was a person _here_ and a person _there_, and the love is moving towards them. It can deepen. And it's almost like the sense of the person begins to _blur_ a bit. And there is just the sense of two hearts, and a flow, a radiation, between the two hearts. And even that can deepen. And can become, at times, a sense of a kind of communion of hearts. There's just really one heart, one consciousness, imbued with love. Beautiful possibility - not forever, but for a moment, for a stretch of time. Again, not to snatch at any of this. I'm just saying what can come sometimes from the practice. | <span class="blockid">13-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#Communion of hearts\|Communion of hearts]]<br/><hr class="cell">Sometimes even _that_ sense begins to fade a little bit, and it's just hearts merging, and just a sense of a kind of communion of hearts. And maybe the sense of the other person is gone a little bit, and there's just maybe light there, or just this sense of communion, warmth. Communion of hearts. In that, then there is a sense of oneness. |
| <span class="blockid">15-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Sensing oneness and non-separateness is a beautiful opening\|Sensing oneness and non-separateness is a beautiful opening]]<br/><hr class="cell">And in that communion of hearts, a sense of oneness. Is it really separate? So oneness is actually something different from _anattā_, what John talked about yesterday. But it's still very important. It's extremely important. Our usual sense of things is separateness, is _not_ oneness: "I'm here, you're there - separate things, separate beings, separate selves." And to begin, in a way, opening ourselves, getting a taste of some other sense, a sense of oneness. It's not an ultimate truth, but it's extremely important, an extremely beautiful opening. | <span class="blockid">13-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0125 Expressions of Metta#A sense of merging begins to question our taken-for-granted perception of separation\|A sense of merging begins to question our taken-for-granted perception of separation]]<br/><hr class="cell">Now, oneness - I'll go into this in a bit more detail, too, in another talk, other _talks_ - oneness is not quite the same as not-self, anattā, but it's hugely important. It's hugely important for a human being to open to that sense of oneness in their life. It's a sense that comes and goes, but it begins, potentially, to question the perception, our everyday, taken-for-granted perception of separation: "I'm here, you're there. I'm here, the world is out there." This is our everyday, normal consciousness perception. If - and I'm talking about a lot of practice with mettā - if there is this going in and out of the sense of oneness, a sense of just merging, a communion of hearts, it really does begin to question our taken-for-granted perception of separation. And a person can wonder over time: what actually is the truth? Separation? Oneness? What's the truth? |
| <span class="blockid">15-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#What is true separateness or oneness\|What is true, separateness or oneness?]]<br/><hr class="cell">And again, _can_ be that a person goes in and out of that kind of experience many times. And the more significant thing - rather than staying in a sense of oneness, which is not ultimately true - the more significant thing is actually the question, "What is true?" Typical, unenlightened consciousness assumes separate self to be true. It's just - it's a given! It's obvious! Or then we might assume oneness to be true. What's true? |  |

Through the change of perceptions that is possible sometimes, we question our perceptions, and in that, beginning to go deeper into truth. |  |
