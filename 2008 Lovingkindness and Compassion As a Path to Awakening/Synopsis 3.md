| <span class="blockid">1-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#What helps what blocks loving-kindness\|What helps, what blocks loving-kindness?]]<br/><hr class="cell">So we can cultivate, develop, expand the heart's capacity for loving-kindness. That is possible for us, and in the process of doing that we need to be asking, well, what helps that process? What feeds that process? How does that expansion come about? How does the heart grow in loving-kindness? We need to be asking those questions and also asking, what blocks it? What starves it? What gets in the way? |  |
| <span class="blockid">1-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Faith in reconditioning mind and heart by just repeting the phrases; samadhi\|Faith in reconditioning mind and heart by just repeting the phrases; samadhi]]<br/><hr class="cell">And so very broadly speaking, just the repetition of the phrases, on the cushion, in the walking meditation, just having faith in that level of reconditioning the mind, reconditioning the heart - hugely significant. And just over and over again, we are retraining the intentionality in the mind and the heart. And sometimes, when the _samādhi_ itself is there, that, too, is a way in which the heart's capacity increases. |  |
| <span class="blockid">1-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Body sensitivity allows samadhi to go deeper\|Body sensitivity allows samadhi to go deeper]]<br/><hr class="cell">There are many ways this happens. Some are on the cushion in full meditation and some informal. So how we act, how we speak, what we choose, how we are in our interactions - that's feeding the _mettā_ as well. And we need to inquire into that - as important what happens outside of formal meditation as it is inside. And then, within formal meditation, sometimes it feels like it's going well, okay? It feels good. There's the _samādhi_ there - great, lovely, and put a lot of emphasis on this, inclining towards that. So this is why we keep saying about the body, the body sensitivity. And you drop a word in or a phrase, and it has some resonance in the body sensitivity, or the body feels peaceful, there's a feeling of peace around, there's a feeling of warmth, of happiness - actually connecting with that in the body, feeling it, feeling just a sense of comfort in the body, just a vague, unremarkable sense of well-being. That connection with those kinds of feelings in the body helps the _samādhi_. It allows the _samādhi_, the unification to go deeper. And in so doing, the _mettā_ kind of gets into the cells, becomes, in a very deep way, part of the habit, a habit for the being, a habit for the consciousness via the body and via the _samādhi_. |  |
| <span class="blockid">1-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#If it doesn't feel to be going well just keep having faith\|If it doesn't feel to be going well, just keep having faith]]<br/><hr class="cell">And sometimes, it doesn't feel to be going well. It feels like there's no feeling, I'm even irritated or whatever, aversive, there's fear around, whatever it is - doesn't feel like it's going well. That's fine too. And what we said right at the beginning: just keep having faith in this planting of the seeds with the phrases, just planting the seeds of intention. Not to jump too much into judging one's practice, by whether it feels like it's going well or whether it feels like it's going badly. There's too much going on, so to speak, underneath the radar, in the darkness of what is not conscious, and we have to kind of respect that and have some faith in the process. |  |
| <span class="blockid">1-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Simile gardener having faith that the seed grows underground\|Simile: gardener having faith that the seed grows underground]]<br/><hr class="cell">I can't remember if I said this already in here, but when a farmer or a gardener plants a seed, the germination of that seed, the nourishment of that seed goes on underneath the ground, in the darkness, invisible. And it's very similar with the _mettā_ practice. There's a lot going on at levels we don't actually have access to. To trust that. So there is certainly the fact of the _mettā_ deepening and expanding through the _samādhi_, but also deepening and expanding through just this patient faith in the planting of the seeds. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#As we practice metta insight comes with that\|As we practice metta, insight comes with that]]<br/><hr class="cell">What I want to go into today is the relationship of insight and the deepening of love and the deepening of compassion. So on this retreat, what we talk about - and we've already started, and it kind of gets more and more as it goes on - is the way that the practices of love and compassion actually bring insight, as part of what they bring. They bring a liberating insight. They bring insight that frees. This is not the usually understood way of understanding love and compassion, but it's there. And as we practise loving-kindness and compassion, insight comes with that - _can_ come with that. It's a possibility. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#It works the other way around as well insight feeds loving-kindness and compassion\|It works the other way around as well: insight feeds loving-kindness and compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">What I want to talk about today is the other way round: how it might be that insight feeds loving-kindness and compassion. So I'm talking about the ways loving-kindness and compassion can be fed: in our lives, in our interactions, in the _samādhi_, through the patient planting of the seeds, and now just this piece about insight leading to love and compassion. | <span class="blockid">1-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#What is going on in this retreat here how insights can lead to love\|What is going on in this retreat, here: how insights can lead to love]]<br/><hr class="cell">So through this practice, in this retreat, a number of things are going on, hopefully. And one is the cultivation of the mettā. We could say the awakening of the heart, the awakening of a different way of being in the world. One could say that. And the development of the mettā, the deepening of the mettā as a gift, as a healing for ourselves and for the world. And all the benefits that that brings, and all the beauty that that brings. And we've talked also about the samādhi, and the development of that and the benefits of that. And in this retreat in particular, how love develops insight. How love itself and the development of love leads to insight. We'll be talking more about that. But in _this_ talk, what I want to go into a little bit is how insights can lead to love, how the process of insight can feed and nourish the process of mettā and compassion. So nourishing love through insight. |
| <span class="blockid">2-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Are we creating metta or are we uncovering it\|Are we creating metta or are we uncovering it?]]<br/><hr class="cell">Sometimes we can be doing this practice, and we feel as if we are creating the _mettā_. You're sort of sitting and huffing and puffing and squeezing and ... [laughs] And if you're lucky, you know, a drop of _mettā_. It feels like it's something fabricated, created, which it _is_, on one level. But sometimes we might ask ourselves a question: is love something created? Now, actually it _is_, but are _we_ creating it? What's actually going on there? Or is it maybe the case that love and compassion may be the natural state and a natural expression when the heart, when the consciousness is not entangled or obscured or clouded by clinging and by delusion? It's much more as if one is _uncovering_ love and _uncovering_ compassion. So that's an interesting question: what's actually going on here? Are we creating it? Or are we _uncovering_ it? Are we _allowing_ it? | <span class="blockid">1-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Metta is fabricated but it's also the natural state\|Metta is fabricated, but it's also the natural state]]<br/><hr class="cell">It can seem at first that what we're doing in this practice is we're putting in lots of huff and puff, and building up some mettā, creating some mettā, creating love. And in a sense, that's true. Mettā is a fabrication, it's true. All things are fabrications, and mettā is a fabrication. But what can also seem to be the case - and it can move towards this becoming clearer - is that perhaps love, mettā, compassion, is the natural state, the natural expression when the mind, the consciousness is not clouded by clinging and ignorance. When the clinging is relaxed, the mettā is there, the compassion is there and the love is there. And as ignorance, as this misunderstanding of the nature of the self, the nature of the world, the nature of things, as that begins to dissolve a little bit, in the moments when that's not there so strong, then the love is there as a natural state and a natural expression. |
| <span class="blockid">2-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Insight is any kind of understanding that releases clinging and thus suffering\|Insight is any kind of understanding that releases clinging and thus suffering]]<br/><hr class="cell">When we talk about insight and insight meditation, it's a very good question to ask: what does that mean? What is insight? What is insight meditation? Insight is an understanding - so either intellectual or intuitive, any kind of understanding - that releases clinging, and in so doing, releases suffering. So that the mark of insight is this release of suffering. That's how you know that what's going on is an insight. Suffering either goes completely or just lessens to some degree because of some way of seeing or some way of understanding. Insight releases clinging, and in releasing the clinging, the struggling, the pushing away, the pulling, the holding on, the identifying - any form of clinging - insight releases the clinging. And because it releases the clinging, suffering is released. | <span class="blockid">1-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Insight is that which releases clinging\|Insight is that which releases clinging]]<br/><hr class="cell">When we talk about insight, oftentimes we use this word, and we say 'insight meditation,' and sometimes it's sort of, "I wonder what's actually meant there?" Insight, to me, is that which releases clinging. Okay? So there's clinging, there's constricting ourselves around something inner or outer, pushing it away, pulling it towards us, holding on to it, struggling with it. And clinging brings with it suffering. Insight is that which, either through intellectual understanding, through reflection, just an intuitive sense, some very organic sense, at any level at all (fairly easy or superficial, right down to the depths of understanding), releases that clinging and therefore releases suffering. So that's what insight is. The Buddha's enormously interested in this, and he's interested in ways of seeing, ways of seeing ourselves, our lives, the moment, ways of seeing and relating, that bring this release. And with the release, with the release from clinging, comes love. So ways of looking that bring a release of clinging and bring with that love. |
| <span class="blockid">2-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Insight from not doing much or doing nothing at all\|Insight from not doing much or doing nothing at all]]<br/><hr class="cell">When the Buddha talked about insight meditation, there's a number of ways of interpreting it. One way would be that it's just kind of sitting around, or watching what's going on, and trying not to _do_ much. [laughs] And hopefully out of that, _budoom_, up comes an insight, which is perfectly valid, to an extent. [laughter] But sometimes we might find, you're watching your breath, or just, you know ... [huffing and puffing] "In, out, in, out, arising, falling, arising, falling," and _hoping_ that out of that, insight cracks into the being. Or just trying to sit there doing nothing, and again the hope, the assumption is that in that 'doing nothing,' an insight will be born. There is definitely something to that, and in a way - I'm not putting it in very attractive terms, but it's actually a very beautiful approach to practice. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Alternative practice ways of looking that bring release\|Alternative: practice ways of looking that bring release]]<br/><hr class="cell">Oftentimes, though, the Buddha talks about another approach, which is more, "Can we practise ways of seeing and ways of relating?" So what he means when he talks about insight meditation or insight is _practising_ certain ways of looking at experience in the moment, _practising_ ways of looking that bring release, that let go of the clinging. So we typically look in ways that actually lead to clinging, lead to suffering. That's what we do all the time. The Buddha said, "Can you learn to look in different ways that bring release?" Release of the clinging brings release from suffering, and that brings love. That brings love. | <span class="blockid">1-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Constrictions block our capacity to love\|Constrictions block our capacity to love]]<br/><hr class="cell">And so what I want to go into a little bit is perhaps a possibility of incorporating some of that into the mettā practice and the practice of compassion. So we can see in our lives (and hopefully this should get more and more clear as our understanding deepens): when there is clinging or aversion, there's less love. So a very obvious one is fear. Fear is a kind of clinging, it's a kind of aversion, a kind of constriction. When that's around, it kind of blocks love. It blocks our capacity to love, our capacity of openness of heart, of connection. And we can actually see that love and fear have a kind of inversely proportional relationship, as the mathematicians say: more fear, kind of the less accessibility to love. And love has a way of actually dissolving fear, can do. Conversely, we can see in ourselves, certainly, and in the world and in others, how much when there's a lot of fear, oftentimes there's a lot of anger right there, a lot of violence right there, and we just have to open a newspaper to see a lot of that. |
| <span class="blockid">3-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#This talk is about incorporating some of those ways of looking into metta practice\|This talk is about incorporating some of those ways of looking into metta practice]]<br/><hr class="cell">So insight, practising ways of [seeing] - I'll go into what I mean. I'm talking a little bit abstractly. I realize that it might sound a little abstract right now. I'll explain what I mean as I go through today. Practising ways of seeing and relating that bring freedom, release, and love. And what I want to go into today is, is it possible (and these are just possibilities) that we can incorporate some of those ways of looking, some of those practices, into the _mettā_ practice itself, so that we've kind of got a refining of the _mettā_ practice that's possible, and the compassion practice that's possible? I'll explain what I mean. |  |
|  | <span class="blockid">2-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Baba Amte\|Baba Amte]]<br/><hr class="cell">A little over a couple of years ago, I had the good fortune to meet someone in India. Not a spiritual person at all. He didn't regard himself that way, very sort of humanist person. I and some friends, about ten or twelve of us, had gone out to work at a leprosy community in Maharashtra in India, and spent about a month there. And met the guy who started this community. His name is Baba Amte. His story is quite remarkable, and it kind of illustrates this relationship between fear and love. |
|  | <span class="blockid">2-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#"If you want to understand someone you have to step into their shoes for a while"\|"If you want to understand someone, you have to step into their shoes for a while"]]<br/><hr class="cell">He'd grown up very rich, one of these very wealthy Indian, almost aristocratic [families], and got a job as a lawyer at some point, and then met Gandhi when he was a young man. And somehow moved towards representing the disenfranchised in India. So he was, I think, living in Calcutta and representing the people, the workers who clean out the sewers in Calcutta. So you can kind of imagine what conditions they were living in, and was trying to represent them legally. And Gandhi said to him at one point, "If you want to understand someone, you have to step into their shoes for a while." |
|  | <span class="blockid">2-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Finding a dying man in the sewers of Calcutta\|Finding a dying man in the sewers of Calcutta]]<br/><hr class="cell">So he took that, he took Gandhi at his words, and he got a job down there cleaning the sewers in Calcutta. You can imagine. He decided to do that for a year. And one day, he was coming home at night in the dark from a day's working in the sewers, and he tripped over something in the road. He looked down, and he saw that it was a man lying in the road, abandoned and dying of leprosy in its final stages. He saw this man there and was so horrified that he ran home. Immediate kind of knee-jerk response, and he ran to his home. And when he arrived home, kind of out of breath, he got there and then he realized, "Oh, what have I done?" And he sort of gathered himself, went back, found the man, picked him up, took him home, and nursed him in the days until he died, and was with him in that period. |
|  | <span class="blockid">2-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Maharashtra\|Maharashtra]]<br/><hr class="cell">He had already seen this kind of relationship between fear and love, and the closing that can come with fear. But he said that was really a turning point for him. So he gave up his job as a lawyer, and he somehow bent the ear of the Maharashtran government to give him a piece of desert scrubland. He and his wife and two baby boys, I think four lepers and a lame cow [laughter], this ragtaggle mob, went to this scrub piece of desert, basically, in Maharashtra. They started, mostly him, started to build this community. And that was, I think, in the early fifties. I went there a few years ago. And amazing what's been built there. Five thousand people or something live there. They're completely self-subsistent in many things. Beautiful place, a lot of joy there. And remarkable to meet this man. I mean, this is kind of extraordinary, you know - most of us, we can only appreciate that. And to meet this man who consistently in his life had chosen love over fear, and that he was 92, and actually has not been able to walk or has not been able to stand up for, I don't know how many years, forty years or something. All he can do is walk a little and lie down. And just the presence that was there through a lifetime of keeping making the choice of love over fear, love over fear, love over fear. Really extraordinary. |
| <span class="blockid">3-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Fear is an aversion that blocks love\|Fear is an aversion that blocks love]]<br/><hr class="cell">In a way, I sort of want to start by going off on a bit of a tangent. But it always seems relevant on this retreat, so I'm going to do it again. And that has to do with - to speak a little bit about fear. So fear actually is an example of a kind of clinging or a kind of aversion. Fear is actually a species of aversion that blocks love. Fear blocks love. And to investigate this in our lives. Is that the case, that when we're afraid there's a kind of closing of the love? And we might notice - if you pay attention, you might notice that love and fear have this kind of inverse relationship. Originally, the Buddha offered the _mettā_ practice to a group of monks who were really, really afraid in the forest. That was his initial offering as an antidote and as a response to fear.^[According to the commentary to the _Sutta Nipāta_, the Buddha taught the _Mettā Sutta_ (Sn 1:8) as a protective discourse to a group of monks who were experiencing frightening visions and sounds produced by hostile deities. See Bhikkhu Bodhi, tr., _The Suttanipāta: An Ancient Collection of the Buddha's Discourses Together with Its Commentaries_ (Boston: Wisdom, 2017), 566-7] But we might notice in our lives that when fear is strong, love is weak. And when love is strong, fear is weak. They have this inverse relationship. And conversely, we might also notice, in ourselves and in the world, when fear is strong, violence - either a psychological or a physical violence - is strong. It goes with fear. You can see this very easily in animals, in beings, in ourselves, in political groups, in ideological groups. | <span class="blockid">2-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Don't push away fear but incline the awareness a bit towards loveliness\|Don't push away fear, but incline the awareness a bit towards loveliness]]<br/><hr class="cell">So I want to just, in a way, actually, now that I mention it, take a little bit of a tangent. Because some people have been saying that fear has been coming up in the practice, and anyway there's this relationship between fear and love. So I just want to say a little bit about working with fear. As I mentioned, I think, in the talk on samādhi, sometimes the mind feels like it's deepening and opening into kind of new states, new senses of openness, or depths. And sometimes, with that, a fear will come up. Some of the time, there are these two things kind of going on at once: there's a sense of the new space and the openness of that and maybe the loveliness of that, even, and the fear. And at the same time, they're there. If the fear isn't that strong - and sometimes there's no fear, but if the fear isn't that strong, it's possible not to ignore the fear, but also just to kind of tip the mind over a little bit, tip the awareness over a little bit to go into the loveliness. Just incline the mind to what's pleasant there, even if it's just very non-dramatically pleasant. Give the mind some sense of enjoyment, of something that it can trust there. Not pushing away the fear or ignoring it. It can be really skilful if that feels like it's going on in the practice. If it feels really strong, then it needs turning to and working with. And sometimes, of course, fear has nothing to do with the practice or whatever. So I just want to briefly go into working with fear a little bit. |
| <span class="blockid">3-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Samadhi can bring up fear\|Samadhi can bring up fear]]<br/><hr class="cell">So I want to say a little bit about working with fear, because often it _does_ come up in the context of a retreat like this anyway for people. And working with fear would usually come under the umbrella of insight meditation, learning to work with that. I mentioned in one of the talks (I think it was the talk on _samādhi_): sometimes in a practice like this - we're sitting, walking - _something_ feels like it's deepening and opening. And maybe just isolated moments, or little stretches of time or whatever, the being, the consciousness, finds itself in territory that's unfamiliar: much more open, perceptions have changed a little bit, the body feels different, the sense of separation feels different, the sense of self feels different, maybe dramatically so, maybe just a little bit. And this can bring up fear. |  |
| <span class="blockid">3-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#When the fear is not that strong you can dip into what's enjoyable and not give so much attention to the fear\|When the fear is not that strong, you can dip into what's enjoyable and not give so much attention to the fear]]<br/><hr class="cell">And very, very skilful to learn, if the fear is not too strong, then actually one has a choice in that moment. With that opening, the opening of the being, the opening of consciousness, there will be some pleasantness with that, alongside the fear. And this fear and the pleasantness coexist. What usually happens is we get sucked into the fear, and like a magnet, we go into the fear. We get pulled into it and spun around by it, with it. Sometimes it's possible just to sit back a little bit and have a look: I've got this pleasant enjoyment in the body, there's openness, there's warmth, etc. There's a letting go, and there's fear. And learn - and this is a skill, it's a practice - learn to incline the awareness towards what's enjoyable in there. So in that openness, there _will_ be something that's enjoyable. It's an acquired taste to learn how to dip in a little bit, dip in. You can be in control of this. You can dip into what's enjoyable and not give so much attention to the fear. You don't have to ignore it, but you also don't have to feed it by getting obsessed with it and worried about it and drawn into it. So this is a practice, but it's actually very important, when the fear is not that strong. |  |
| <span class="blockid">4-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#When the fear is stronger ask what actually is fear Body sensations\|When the fear is stronger, ask: what actually is fear? Body sensations]]<br/><hr class="cell">But sometimes, of course, fear does feel stronger. Or it feels like we're unable to do that. And sometimes we get very strong fear, maybe in the context of a retreat and, of course, outside a retreat. When we look at fear, we have to ask, what actually is fear? What is the experience of fear? It's an interesting one - or anxiety. And when we look, what do we see in the experience? So oftentimes we don't hang out with it long enough to actually unpack it and see what's there. What we notice with fear is usually unpleasant body sensations - in the extreme, the heart is pounding, the tummy is in knots or butterflies. Unpleasant body sensation, and aversion to the physical sensations. We don't like them. We want to get rid of them. That's there alongside the unpleasant sensations. So body sensations and aversion. | <span class="blockid">3-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Fear involves unpleasant body sensations and a constriction of the mind\|Fear involves unpleasant body sensations and a constriction of the mind]]<br/><hr class="cell">So, often we run away from fear, we don't even stop to wait and investigate a little bit: what actually is this that I'm running away from? What actually is fear? If we go into it a little bit more clearly, can see: fear is, one way of breaking it down is, fear involves some unpleasant physical sensations - you know, the heart pounding, or the tummy butterflying or whatever - unpleasant physical sensations, and the reaction to them, their being unpleasant. Usually, not always, some thoughts, which are generally unpleasant, spinning around, and the reaction to them. Body sensations, unpleasant, and reaction; the thoughts, unpleasant, and the reaction. And then something a bit more subtle: a constriction of the mind, a constriction of consciousness. It feels like consciousness kind of shrinks down with fear and becomes very small. And we don't generally like having a small consciousness; we enjoy more a spacious kind of consciousness. And so that constricting of the consciousness is also experienced as unpleasant, and there will be a reaction to that, generally a reaction of aversion. |
|  | <span class="blockid">3-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Piecemeal approach to working with fear\|Piecemeal approach to working with fear]]<br/><hr class="cell">Not to be anal, but that kind of constellation is what makes up fear. And just to mention that, just to go into that in order to have ways in to work with fear, so that we can get hold of a piece and begin working with it, rather than just being overwhelmed by this mass of fear, which is often the case. |
| <span class="blockid">4-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Thoughts also have aversion associated with them\|Thoughts also have aversion associated with them]]<br/><hr class="cell">Thoughts. Often thoughts, and often future thoughts, associated with fear, and unpleasant thoughts about what's going to happen or what might happen. Thoughts associated with fear, as part of the constellation of fear, and again, their unpleasantness, the aversion to them, aversion to that. So there are the body sensations and the thoughts, and in each case there's aversion. |  |
| <span class="blockid">4-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Inner texture of the mind shrinks when there's fear around\|Inner texture of the mind shrinks when there's fear around]]<br/><hr class="cell">Third factor, a little more subtle, with fear is the kind of climate of the mind, the inner texture of the way the mind feels. And when there's fear around, it shrinks. The mind shrinks. It gets small. You notice this with fear? The actual consciousness feels like it's constricting. That, generally speaking, is unpleasant. Human beings don't like a constricted consciousness. And so, again, it being unpleasant, there's going to be aversion to it: I want to get rid of it. I want it to go away. So there's the body, the thoughts, and the texture, the climate of the mind, and correspondingly, the aversion to that. |  |
| <span class="blockid">4-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We are afraid of fear but we can be with this which brings confidence\|We are afraid of fear, but we can be with this, which brings confidence]]<br/><hr class="cell">These aversions are very important to investigate, because when we ask, "What's my relationship with fear?" - and this is a fundamental Dharma question, "What's my relationship with _anything_?" - usually the relationship with fear is, we're afraid of it. We're actually afraid of fear. We have fear of fear. This is part of what makes fear _fear_. It's that we're actually afraid of the fear itself. As our meditation practice, in general, develops over time, we learn to - we _can_ learn to accommodate that experience of fear: the body experience, the thinking experience, and the texture of the mind experience. We learn to just bring mindfulness to it and just to be with it. And what we get, slowly, over time, is a sense of confidence that it's just some unpleasant sensations, just some unpleasant thoughts: "I can be with this. Awareness can hold it." What's almost always lacking with fear is confidence. We don't feel confident that we can actually be with the fear and accommodate it, and be okay with it. With practice, bringing mindfulness to all of it, we just see: it's just that, and it's accommodatable. Confidence comes. It's hugely significant. | <span class="blockid">3-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Practice total acceptance of the physical sensations of fear\|Practice: total acceptance of the physical sensations of fear]]<br/><hr class="cell">So what is fear? Beginning to get a handle on it. What is our relationship with fear? Generally, it's aversion, it's unpleasant and we flee it. We have fear of fear. Now, this is very common. There's fear around, and we're actually afraid of fear. It's so unpleasant that we're running away from it. In practice, we can begin working with fear in different ways so that we gradually learn to accommodate fear. And gradually, slowly, over time, learn to have a confidence with fear, with the presence of fear. This is one thing that's lacking. Fear comes up, and we're afraid of it, we don't feel confident with it. If it's possible to actually practise in a different way, even instead of trying to be so mindful of the fear, practising complete - if possible, as complete as possible - a total acceptance of the physical sensations of fear. So that consciousness or awareness feels like it's actually more spacious than the fear. The fear sensations can be there in a spacious awareness, and they're just allowed, they're just allowed. They're welcomed, even. So this really is a practice. |
|  | <span class="blockid">3-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#"I can accomodate this"\|"I can accomodate this"]]<br/><hr class="cell">And over time one of the things that can develop is we really begin to feel like, it's just some unpleasant sensations. Awareness, "I can accommodate this. I can accommodate this." And it's possible for the unpleasant sensations to be there without any constriction of the mind or paralysis or freaking out or anything like that. It's really a practice, but it's a genuine possibility. |
| <span class="blockid">4-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Fear of fear feeds the fire of the fear\|Fear of fear feeds the fire of the fear]]<br/><hr class="cell">So usually our relationship with fear is one of aversion or fleeing. We want to get away from, run away from the unpleasantness of it. But that very aversion and fleeing makes the experience of the fear increase. This fear of the fear, this aversion to the fear, is part of the whole constellation. It's part of the whole mechanism and wheel of fear. It makes it more difficult. When there are unpleasant fear sensations in the body and we flee them out of aversion, out of fear of them, where do we go? Where do we flee to? Straight up into the head! The energy goes away from the groundedness in the body and straight up into the head. There's more energy in the thinking. There are already unhelpful, unskilful, unpleasant thoughts in the thinking, looping around. You've just injected a whole lot of extra energy in there because one is fleeing. And it increases, actually feeding the whole fire of the fear. | <span class="blockid">4-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Fleeing from fear makes the fear increase\|Fleeing from fear makes the fear increase]]<br/><hr class="cell">So usually the relationship, as I said, to fear, is aversion, and it's fleeing the unpleasant. That fleeing actually makes the fear increase. The aversion is not something neutral. This is really important. So our aversion to things is not a neutral element. When we flee fear, which is understandable, but when we flee it, when we're averse to it, it actually makes the fear increase. It makes it feel more difficult. |
|  | <span class="blockid">4-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#When we flee we go straight up into the mind\|When we flee we go straight up into the mind]]<br/><hr class="cell">This fleeing, this aversion, is part of the constellation of fear. When we flee the physical sensations, where do we flee to? We don't like the physical sensations, where do we go? We go straight up into the mind, which is already spinning with thoughts. And that energy goes into the mind, into the thinking, and just adds to the kind of whirlwind up there. The thoughts spiral. They're generally not helpful anyway at that point, and we get an increase in fear. |
| <span class="blockid">5-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Fear needs me to be aversive and reactive to it\|Fear needs me to be aversive and reactive to it]]<br/><hr class="cell">So the reaction that we have to fear is not something separate from the fear itself. They're not two separate things. The reaction is part of the anxiety itself. So you can check this out. They're not two separate things. If we can soften that reaction or take away that reaction somewhat, what we'll notice is that fear cannot support itself. It cannot support itself. So not to take this on authority just because I say it or someone else says it. See if one can experiment with this when fear is around. Fear needs me to be aversive and reactive to it. The reaction is part of the mechanism. What happens when I soften that reaction? Fear cannot support itself without me fearing it, without me reacting to it. | <span class="blockid">4-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#The aversion to fear is part of the fear itself\|The aversion to fear is part of the fear itself]]<br/><hr class="cell">This reaction to fear and anxiety, the reaction to anxiety is actually _part of_ the anxiety itself. It's not that there's anxiety, and now I have whatever reaction to it. The fear of the fear, the fleeing of it, the aversion to it, is actually part of the fear itself. They're not two separate things. If I can learn through practice to really welcome the sensations of fear, I'm actually taking away that reaction of aversion, and I'll see, through practice, the fear cannot support itself. It cannot support itself without my reaction of aversion. It cannot. And not to take my word for it - to see in one's own practice: fear needs my fear of it. Fear needs my aversion to it. Otherwise it cannot support itself. |
| <span class="blockid">5-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Self-judgement is also fuel for the fire of fear\|Self-judgement is also fuel for the fire of fear]]<br/><hr class="cell">Sometimes our relationship with fear is putting pressure - part of the aversion - pressure on it to be different. It's all the same: it's fuel for the fire of fear. So to be aware of these mechanisms, to see, "Can they be relaxed? Can I soften them?" Or judging myself - if I judge myself that fear is around, again, it's fuel for the fire. What am I assuming about myself because there's fear around? What am I assuming about my practice? That I'm a failure, that it's rubbish, that I'm not getting anywhere - just because fear is around? That's also something that we're injecting into the moment that's building the fear. | <span class="blockid">4-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Judging of myself adds fuel to the fire of fear\|Judging of myself adds fuel to the fire of fear]]<br/><hr class="cell">So, to see, when fear is around, because it's very normal, it's very human: am I putting a pressure on it? Am I pushing it away? A pressure for it to be different? Am I judging myself that it's around? "Boy, I'm really going backward now. I'm a crappy meditator, should probably just leave these good people to get on with it and go home." What am I telling myself? What am I concluding about the presence of fear? That judging of myself is putting a pressure on, and that pressure is another factor that will build the fear. It's another factor that adds fuel to the fire of fear. What am I thinking, what am I believing it says about me, that there's fear there? |
| <span class="blockid">5-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Fear is human\|Fear is human]]<br/><hr class="cell">So fear is human. Can we see the humanity of it? Can we bring kindness, again, to meet that humanity, to meet the fear? So when we say, "May _I_ be safe and protected. May _I_ be ..." whatever the other phrases are ... [laughter] When we say that, who is the 'I' in that moment? There's fear around. Who is the 'I'? The 'I' is me with fear. It's not me without the fear, me when the fear goes away, me and idealized fear. You could say, in that moment, you are you with fear, I am I with fear. It's included. We have a tendency - it's all part of the aversion and the almost normal reaction to fear, to want to get it away, and to even exclude that part from the _mettā_. | <span class="blockid">4-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#The actual mechanism of fear is very human\|The actual mechanism of fear is very human]]<br/><hr class="cell">So rather, can we actually shift and see the humanity of fear? That it's such a human thing to have fear, it's actually built into our - I don't know, genetic make-up or whatever. It's built into our biology. It's very human. It's true that a lot of it is unhelpful and irrelevant. But the actual mechanism of fear is very human. Can we actually just open to the fact of the humanity of it? And bring some kindness to ourselves, mettā to oneself. At that moment when I have fear, I'm giving mettā to myself, who is the self right now? Self is with fear. That's who I am. And so it's not the self when this fear goes. It's the self right now with the fear. |
| <span class="blockid">5-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Fear of the future\|Fear of the future]]<br/><hr class="cell">A lot of fear in our lives, in a very general sense, has to do with the future - "What will happen to me? Will I be okay? Will it be all right? Will it turn out okay? What might go wrong?" - on all kinds of levels. You know, basic body level, survival level, but all kinds of other levels, emotionally, in terms of security, in terms of relationships, in terms of possessions, anything, future thoughts: "Will it be okay for me?" | <span class="blockid">4-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Fear of how to take care of the future\|Fear of how to take care of the future]]<br/><hr class="cell">On a sort of larger scale, you know, we think about fear in our lives, and how much of it is actually unnecessary and irrelevant and really not helpful, really just getting in the way. And think how much fear is there because of future thinking, worrying about the future: will I be okay? Will this happen? Will that _not_ happen? Whatever. A huge, really deep part of practice is actually asking ourselves, "I'm worried about the future. I notice fear of the future. Do I actually know, genuinely, how to take care of the future, what that really, really, really means, to take care of the future? What is it that leads to our well-being and happiness, really, _really_?" |
| <span class="blockid">5-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Do I know how to really really take care of the future\|Do I know how to really really take care of the future]]<br/><hr class="cell">One really, really fundamental Dharma question comes up then. Fear about the future and "Will I be okay? How will the future be _for me_?" Fundamental Dharma question: do I really know how to really, really, _really_ take care of the future? What does it mean to _really_ take care of the future? And so, Dharmically, what is it that leads to a sense of security, happiness, well-being, peace in our life? What is it? | <span class="blockid">4-7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#What is it that leads to well-being\|What is it that leads to well-being?]]<br/><hr class="cell">To really understand what leads to happiness, what takes care of the future, to understand that deeply, not just intellectually, in the cells, in the bones, that's, to me, a sign of very mature practice. So, you know, we're inundated with all this advertising, or you need this, you need that. And just the basic things which most of us take for granted, or even want a nice house, or a nice relationship, a nice career and this and that. And just to really understand, _really_, what is it that leads to happiness, what is it that leads to well-being? The Buddha puts enormous emphasis on this question, really understanding and really living this question: what is it that leads to well-being? So all the things that we can get off track with that - what other people think of me, or, you know, it's endless. What other people think of me does not lead to well-being, cannot lead to well-being. No way. It only leads to a repetition of anxiety and tightness. |

'investment portfolio.' [laughter] If you know that term from whatever, stocks and all that stuff. Very actually rare maturity in practice, very rare maturity. Often we can just say, "Yeah, yeah, I know, that's what I need to be happy. I know that I really need to build these qualities. I know that's where happiness comes from." Very rare level of maturity in practice to come across someone who's actually living that out, and putting the investment in that, and not worrying _so_ much about the other stuff. And of _course_, we need to take care of material things, etc. But it's actually quite a mature practice that has come to the point when it's just convinced in the heart, in the being: "I know where to put my eggs. I know what it is that leads to happiness and peace. I know how to take care of the future." And you think how much fear, as well, in this respect has to do with, "What will they think of me? What will people I'm meeting - what are they going to think? Are they going to think I'm stupid, or ugly, or boring, or whatever it is?" How much of our fear is social fear, is around that? | <span class="blockid">5-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#It's the cultivation of beautiful qualities of mind and heart\|It's the cultivation of beautiful qualities of mind and heart]]<br/><hr class="cell">So what _does_ lead to happiness? How _do_ we take care of the future? And the Buddha talks about this. It's through the cultivation of those beautiful qualities of mind and heart. They will be our treasure, our fruit, throughout our life and at our deathbed. So what we're doing here, building love and compassion as habits of the mind and the heart, this is the real treasure. And you know, all the other lists, mindfulness, equanimity, and joy, and this and that. |
| <span class="blockid">6-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We take care of the future by cultivating beautiful qualities\|We take care of the future by cultivating beautiful qualities]]<br/><hr class="cell">When we cultivate beautiful qualities of the heart, beautiful qualities of the mind, they bring with them happiness. And there is enough happiness, and then what people think of me becomes _almost_ insignificant. This is very real, and as I said, it's quite a rare maturity that actually lives that out in one's life, through one's practice. We take care of the future. Fear is fear of the future. How do we take care of the future? Through cultivation. Through the kind of cultivation that we're doing here, and a whole host of other qualities. | <span class="blockid">5-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Cultivation will take care of the future also in relationship to the present\|Cultivation will take care of the future, also in relationship to the present]]<br/><hr class="cell">Cultivation will take care of the future, and also in relationship to the present. We worry about the future, but if the relationship to the present is okay, is open, interested, present, alive, caring, then the future tends to take care of itself. And as I say, I really do think it's a sign of real maturity in practice to really know that and live that. It's quite rare. There's so much else that can distract us and pull us into, "No, I need this. This is what I need. This is the security I need. This is what I need to take care of." So it's really, really some maturity in practice to be clear about this. And it can move to a place where there's just much much less worry about, "Will I be secure when I get old? Will there be enough money? Will I be alone? Will my partner leave? Will they die? Will this, that, that, that, that?" |
| <span class="blockid">6-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Taking care of the relationship with the present\|Taking care of the relationship with the present]]<br/><hr class="cell">And also in the relationship to the present. Is the relationship to the present one of openness, of kindness, of curiosity, of interest, of mindfulness? When the relationship to the present has those qualities in it, the future takes care of itself, just moment by moment. Those two pieces - cultivating what's beautiful, and taking care of the relationship with the present - the future is taken care of in the deepest way. And in a very real way, we come to worry less about, "Will there be enough money later on? Will there be security? Will I be okay in terms of a house? What will happen in terms of, will I find a partner? Will my partner die? Will they stay with me? Will I be alone?" All that stuff, not that it's not important stuff in our lives, but its hold on us, and the fear that oftentimes is around - we don't even realize it's around, running our lives, running our choices. How much of that stuff is actually dictating our choices in our life? And we don't even register it as a kind of fear. And that stuff just begins to get less because of the power of cultivating what's beautiful, over time. And this is something very real. It's not theoretical, and it's not unrealistic. It's something very, very real that can come into the being, into one's life in a very real, very practical way. |  |

I want to offer some possibilities. Really just hear them as that: _optional_ possibilities. So for some people, this will be very interesting, very applicable, and fascinating. For other people, it will just be, "Okay, doesn't really attract me. It doesn't seem to have much to do with me." It's fine, but I want to put them out there. | <span class="blockid">5-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#3 possibilities + anatta\|3 possibilities + anatta]]<br/><hr class="cell">So what I want to look at is, as I said, how to incorporate insight into mettā practice. We can incorporate it and kind of use it as something that feeds and nourishes the mettā in a way as a sort of background to the mettā practice, can bring it in. So when we open up this door, how insight feeds mettā and compassion, it's actually huge. The possibilities are, don't know if they're endless, but there's a ton in there. So I just want to draw out maybe three possibilities, and talk a little bit about this anattā, what John talked about the other day and what we're mentioning quite a lot: this not-self, this emptiness of self, no-self. |
| <span class="blockid">6-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#There can be a sense of oneness opening up\|There can be a sense of oneness opening up]]<br/><hr class="cell">So these are just some of the possibilities, and I think I want to go through - I think there are seven here [**(_i_)-(_vii_)** below]. I mentioned the other day, in the talk the other night, as we do the _mettā_ practice, in a very non-linear way, there can be a deepening. And there can be a sense, at times, of merging, and the heart merging with the heart of another, or a sense of oneness opening up - _can_ be, at times, for some people. When we talk about _anattā_ - and John talked the other day about _anattā_, and I touched on it - when we talk about that, it's actually not the same as oneness. It's something a little bit different. But that oneness is still really important when it comes. | <span class="blockid">5-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Metta practice can lead to the dissolving of the boundaries between self and other\|Metta practice can lead to the dissolving of the boundaries between self and other]]<br/><hr class="cell">Love, the development of mettā - some of you have already mentioned a little bit, but anyway, just as a long-term view - this practice of mettā can lead in the practice to a kind of dissolving of the boundaries between self and other. And there's a kind of, at times, and not to grasp at this, at times, through the practice, through the deepening of the practice, there's a kind of dissolution and a kind of oneness that comes in. And there's just a sense of oneness. Self and other, instead of that separation there's a oneness there. And this is hugely valuable to the practice. I mean, it's a really beautiful thing for the heart to be able to have a sense of and open to, at times. It's not that we will _live_ in a state of oneness, because that's impermanent too. |

There's a little bit, slightly different emphasis in the understanding, and it can be tricky to understand it. The Buddha talks about something called the 'three characteristics,' which some of you may have heard of, and others maybe it might be new. Three characteristics of phenomena, three characteristics of experiences, of things. And they are: **(1)** impermanence, change, **(2)** dukkha or unsatisfactoriness, **(3)** and anattā (not-self, not me, not mine). And I'll go into these a little bit.

Unfortunately, there's a whole current in the teaching that's gone on for about 2,000 years [laughter] and it's still very alive and healthy today, that actually says: "This _is_ bleak, and the more bleak and miserable you get from reflecting on it, the better." [laughter] "If you think about impermanence, and unsatisfactoriness, and this 'not-self' business, and you really feel, 'This is terrible.

The whole existence begins to quake, and there's the renting of garments and the gnashing of teeth, and all this stuff. [laughter] |

They are ways of looking, skills in looking, that in looking bring - _should_ bring, if one's going about it the right way, _should_ bring a sense of freedom and love. They're practices, ways of looking, lenses for looking at experience in the moment that _should_ bring with them freedom and love. And if they're not, if they don't, it means one needs to play with it, tinker with it, until one learns to contemplate that way, contemplate one of the three characteristics, or all of them, in ways that actually bring freedom and love. So it is unfortunate there is this - well, quite a number of strands in the traditions that really feel that one should have a kind of existential angst, or trembling, or fear, or misery, or depression, or kind of _blah_, or whatever.

Sometimes, it's true, contemplating impermanence and things like that, there can be a kind of fear that comes in; sometimes with the not-self, a kind of fear coming. But that's not any end point, and it's not even that it has to be there in a dramatic way. Sometimes people begin contemplating impermanence, etc., and they start getting really frantic about things, and take that as a view that "Wow, my practice must really be going deep now." And actually it's just aversion and fear that's kicked in; it's not really that helpful. |

And if they're not, that's really fine. And one can keep doing the basic practices - absolutely fine. But also want to put out there a sense of how deep these practices of love and compassion can actually go. They're almost - not infinite, but an incredible depth of refinement and subtlety that can come into this practice. And one can just deepen them and bring insight and understanding into that in ways that are very beautiful. It will be attractive to some people. It will seem to fit in with one's previous practice for some people, and less so for others.

So if you're listening and you think, "_Pfff_," you know, that's completely fine. The basic practice, what we're doing, there are no problems with that. You don't have to go complicating it if it feels like this is a complication, or if you're feeling like "I'm not doing it right" or anything like that. What I'm really doing is just offering some possibilities. And in a way, for some people, they will be workable because of previous practice or whatever. For others, it will just be a sense of possibilities for the future; possibilities, maybe a sense of how deep this practice of mettā can actually go, the levels to which it can be taken. I feel like it's important to put out what the possibilities of practice are, even if they don't feel realizable and accessible for me right now, just so that we don't diminish what the possibilities of practice are. So if you're listening and it just feels like, "Interesting, but no, thank you. Forget it," that's completely fine. But also to feel free maybe sometimes to experiment with some of this. |

All of these, there are many ways to go about them. Impermanence. One level of meaning is contemplating, being aware of, remembering, death and the context of our life being so short in the context of the universe and the spans of the universe. So remembering death. Just an aside, but the Buddha was saying, "Monks, you should remember death" or whatever, and one monk said, "Every day I remember death," and he said, "Very good, but not good enough." [laughter] And then another monk said, I don't know, "Every morning and evening I remember death." He said, "Very good, but not good enough," and so it went on. And a monk said, I don't know, "Every time I walk somewhere I remember death." And another monk said, "Every time I exhale I remember death." "Good, very good, but not good enough." And then a monk said, "Every time I inhale and every time I exhale I remember death." And the Buddha said, "Very good." [laughter] |
| <span class="blockid">8-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#a Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life\|a) Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(_i_)** At one level, what the Buddha meant, what he talked about, is **remembering death - remembering death and the unpredictability of life**. So we can be doing the _mettā_ practice, and one's directing, attempting to direct the _mettā_ towards another being and just holding, in the background of awareness, just a light reflection on the fact of their mortality: "They will die. Like all of us, they will die." Now, remember, as I just said, it shouldn't be bleak. It shouldn't be depressing, so only to use this if it feels like it's actually unlocking some love and compassion in the heart. If one introduces it and it just feels like, "Ugh, gosh," a terrible fear, or morbidity or a paralysis comes in, leave it. But you may find that just giving the _mettā_ to the benefactor, giving the _mettā_ to the neutral person, whoever it is, difficult person, and one just reflects, "They are subject to death. They are subject to death." Very likely, they don't know _when_ they're going to die. Not just death, but they're also subject to the whole range of what this word _anicca_ means: uncertainty, change. And our life involves an incredible amount of uncertainty and change. That's the nature, that's the fabric of our existence. And they, like us, are subject to that. So just holding this lightly, this sense of _anicca_ that they are vulnerable to, holding that in the awareness very lightly, as one's doing the _mettā_, can either kick-start the _mettā_ when it feels like it's a little bit blocked or it can't really get off the ground, or deepen it at times when it already feels like it's going. |  |

Another one in relation to death, and it's actually more subtle and perhaps more difficult for people. I'm not sure. Practising - again, all this is practice - **practising learning to see _this moment_ in the context of our death**. So I'll explain what I mean. Science, cosmology, tells us that the universe is 13.7 billion years old - pretty old - and that it will last as least as long. Actually, its future is a little bit uncertain, but ... [laughter] It's either going to collapse back again after about the same amount of time, or keep going, don't know - long, long stretches of time. Our life within that is what? Fifty, seventy, ninety, a hundred years, if one's lucky. And there's a sense - you can practise with, you can play with this sometimes - having a sense of one's life and the lives of others being a very small, a _tiny_ span in the vastness of time, and a vastness of space. And if possible, you can even bring that into the moment. | <span class="blockid">7-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#This moment here is in the context of death\|This moment here is in the context of death]]<br/><hr class="cell">What it's pointing to is wearing some lenses that lead to freedom, through which we look at life. This is what is interesting. It's not just something that, "Oh, yeah, I remember this thing we're supposed to think about, impermanence and death, occasionally." It's actually looking at the current moment through the lens of impermanence. So one meaning of impermanence is death and what I might call vastnesses of time. I think the universe is 13.7 billion years old, which is, you know, just a really long time! [laughter] It's staggeringly vast. Our lives are incredibly short, you know, sixty years if we're lucky, eighty, a hundred if we're really lucky. It's tiny. Can we actually see this moment right now, right now, this moment, through the lens of our death? We don't know what came before. Theories and religious theories aside, we don't know what comes afterwards. This moment here - colour, light, sound - is in the context of death and that kind of vastness. Can you get a sense of the moment through that lens? |

[snaps fingers] What's happening? There's visual form, there's colour, there's sound, there's sight, there's a moment of perception - and it's almost like putting that in the context of this incredible vastness of time. We don't know what came before our life. We don't know what comes after, no matter what all the theories, including the Buddhist theories, say. There's _this moment_ in the context of a massive, almost unfathomably unthinkable unknown. And you can toy with this playing of perception. Something comes: this moment, death, and vastness. And again, instead of unlocking fear, sometimes it can unlock more love. So, things you can play with. |  |

I'm talking about the possibility of taking the whole thing to a whole other level, really. |
| <span class="blockid">8-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#c moment-to-moment impermanence\|c) moment-to-moment impermanence]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(_iii_)** What's most common when we talk about - or in the tradition, when people talk about impermanence and the contemplation of impermanence, is **trying to look, in the moment, at quite a rapid, moment-to-moment impermanence of phenomena**. So every moment, there's something new. Every moment, a thought arises, a moment, a sound, a this, a that. And then when we pay attention to our experience, we see phenomena arising, passing quite rapidly. Now, one approach within that - and remember, we're putting these insight ways of looking in the context of our _mettā_ practice - sometimes you're doing the _mettā_, and you can just open the awareness up a little bit more to this impermanence. These are just possibilities. | <span class="blockid">7-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Impermanence of my self as door into anatta\|Impermanence of my self as door into anatta]]<br/><hr class="cell">So there's death, there's the vastness, there's the contemplation of all of us being subject to uncertainty. When, if through our insight meditation practice or whatever, we're actually contemplating impermanence, we have a current of that contemplation going on, what we can notice is a very rapid kind of impermanence. And this is one of the doors, and for some it's the easiest door, actually, into anattā. When I look at myself, what I call my self and my life, my sense of it at first sight, the sense of the self is something fixed and something that's lasting. I'm the same self that I was yesterday, and that I was twenty years ago, and I will be the same in twenty years' time. But when I look more closely, more microscopically, I actually can't find anything there that stays the same, that doesn't change. Everything is changing. You can get a sense that this self, it's not what I think it is. There's nothing that I could find that's fixed in that way. |
| <span class="blockid">9-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#All I see in the moment is change not a lasting fixed self\|All I see in the moment is change, not a lasting, fixed self]]<br/><hr class="cell">And one notices, all I see in the moment is change. There's just a moment of this [snaps fingers], a moment of that [snaps fingers], a moment - I can't find anything in there that's 'me.' So this is the way impermanence feeds into an understanding of _anattā_ and not-self. The sense of self that one has, almost normally, the natural sense of self is that it's lasting and solid and fixed: "I am the same self I was twenty years ago, and thirty years ago, and I will be, if I'm still alive, in ten, twenty years." We have a sense of a fixed, independent, solid, lasting self. But when I look closely at my experience, what I notice is change, change, change. There's nothing I can find that I can point to and say, "Well, _that's_ what my lasting, fixed self is." All I see is change, and the question is, "_Where_ am I? Who am I?" And when I look at the impermanence of the Present moment, there's a way that the sense of self can become much more permeable, less solid. All I'm noticing is just moments of change. I can't find this solid self. And there's the possibility, in the context of _mettā_ practice, to open up that way. | <span class="blockid">7-7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#The unfindability of a fixed sense gives way for space where metta can come in\|The unfindability of a fixed sense gives way for space where metta can come in]]<br/><hr class="cell">So again, if one's used to contemplating in this way particularly, sometimes in the course of the mettā practice you can just bring in that contemplation. So in a way, one's sitting or walking, doing the mettā, and just a little bit more space to the awareness, including the change that's going on right then, the moment-to-moment change and the unfindability of self, the unfindability of a fixed self. In that space of what opens up, because the sense of solidity of self has given way a little bit, in that space, again, more mettā can come in. It's possible, a whole other level of mettā can come in. Possible to explore, possible to play with. |
| <span class="blockid">9-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Less self less other self to give the love to can deepen the love\|Less self, less other self to give the love to, can deepen the love]]<br/><hr class="cell">And what _can_ happen, again, instead of fear and anxiety and all that, is it deepens the love. It can deepen or kick-start the love - this sense of, "Actually, I can't find anything here that's permanent." Now, you could also contemplate another person, and contemplate, "There's nothing to find _there_ that's permanent." And this is where it starts to get a little strange, because we tend to think of love being between self and other. And as we go into the nature of the self, we find less and less of one. We find less and less solidity. And in that very moment of finding less solidity, instead of the whole love crumbling because we feel, "Well, who's giving love to whom?" [laughter] If I don't find anything here - I don't find any object to give it to - the opposite can happen. And almost paradoxically, there's a deepening of the love. Less self, less _other_ self to give the love to, and somehow, there's a deepening of the quality of the love - _can_ be. Remember, all this is just actually very rapidly painting a whole range of possibilities. That was three, with the impermanence. |  |

So I'm not going in any particular order of difficult or subtle or whatever, but ... point to it. It kind of follows on from the one I just said. If I look at my experience in insight meditation, or even broadening my awareness in the _mettā_ practice - I'm doing the _mettā_ practice, but I just open it up a little bit - and again, what do I see? Change, change, change, change, change. Can't find anything that's not changing. What do I find, though, when I look, and I look for myself? All I see, all I can find, are perceptions. | <span class="blockid">8-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#All I see are moments of perception that are both part of the world and part of me\|All I see are moments of perception that are both part of the world and part of me]]<br/><hr class="cell">Another possibility. I'm just going through a lot of territory very quickly. Really, just to let go of what doesn't feel relevant, and maybe to take a few pieces or one piece or whatever. With impermanence, when I look again at my experience and what I call my self, all I actually see is a perception. A perception of a body sensation, a perception of a sight, a sound. I can't find anything else but perceptions of things. Or a thought or an emotion. All I see - there's nothing else. To have a perception requires some thing to perceive. And I see: I can't find a self, and all I find is these moments of perception. It's almost as if 'I,' the 'I' is nothing else but these moments of perception. Because perception takes a world to perceive, outer or inner, it means that this self, being only perception, is not separate from the world. This is not easy to understand, I know, but all I see is moments of perception. Those moments of perception are part of the world and part of me. I cannot separate. If I can open to that sense of non-separation, in the non-separation comes the love, a whole deeper sense of love, possibility, and of not-self. First characteristic: impermanence and change, death. |
| <span class="blockid">9-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Those perceptions are not separate from the universe from the world\|Those perceptions are not separate from the universe, from the world]]<br/><hr class="cell">That's all I can find: perception of carpet, perception of microphone, perception of Julie, perception of person, perception of sound, perception of body, perception of emotion - all I find in my experience is a series of perceptions. When I look inside, that's all I can find. Can't find anything that's not a perception. It's not possible. Can't find anything that's not a perception. A perception needs the world. So, to perceive the carpet, I need for that to be there. **All I find when I look for myself are perceptions, and those perceptions are not separate from the universe, from the world**. We tend to think of the self as something separate and independent. When I look for it, all I find are perceptions, which are actually inseparable from the rest of the universe. They are inseparable. This is quite a subtle point. It's not an easy point either to understand or to work with in meditation, but I want to mention it. I find nothing but perceptions, and they are inseparable, and in a way, it's seeing - it's a way that this impermanence can lead to an understanding of emptiness. Can't find a separate self. And again, can't find a giver of the love or a receiver of the love and yet, in that, it deepens the love. |  |

But some of you will be attracted and say, "Some other time, I'd like to explore some of this." And just to know what's available, what is a possibility. So there's impermanence. |  |

So this means unsatisfactoriness or suffering in its very broad sense. One reflection is that, again, we're actually all in the same boat with this. We're all subject to dukkha, subject to the difficulties of life, to the struggles of life, to the problems and the sufferings of life. Sometimes just dropping that thought in - so this is much simpler now - you're doing the mettā, and you just drop in the thought of, "We share that. We are all in the same boat with dukkha. It's a factor of life. It's a fact of existence." And just dropping in this sense of, "We are all in the same boat." What does that do to the heart? What will that do to the mettā? |
| <span class="blockid">10-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#e Just to realize suffering is part of life - we are all in the same boat\|e) Just to realize: suffering is part of life - we are all in the same boat]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(_v_)** So now this one is back to a relatively simple way of going about things. Just to realize: suffering is part of life. Okay? Suffering comes into everyone's life, in all kinds of ways and all kinds of levels. This is just a fact of our existence. First Noble Truth, Buddha said: "There is suffering, _dukkha_." There is suffering, and a whole range of it and a whole breadth of it. And sometimes we're doing the _mettā_ - and later on, all this applies to compassion practice as well, and we'll move on to compassion next week - **one is doing the _mettā_ practice, and just to drop in, directing it to someone else, just to drop in, "We are all in the same boat. We are all in the same boat with suffering."** So, this body experiences suffering. That body, this body, experiences suffering, experiences pain, experiences discomfort, experiences illness at times, will experience death. Some of these blend into each other. But just to reflect - you can just drop this in or have it as a light background to help the _mettā_, or kick-start the _mettā_: "We're all in the same boat. We all share these encounters with suffering in our life. We all meet suffering in all kinds of ways - through the difficulties we have in relationship, and circumstance, and life, and experience, internally in the body and the mind." To bring that in as ways of feeding, deepening, injecting some life sometimes into the _mettā_ practice. So we're all in the same boat. (It's not a great phrase, but you know what I mean.) |  |

And it _will_ open and close many times in a day, countless times in our life. Opens and closes. **If you just have a light attention and interest there to when it's open and when it's closed, the heart centre, what you notice is: when there's clinging, guess what? [laughs] Closed, no entry! When we release clinging, the heart centre opens.** Now, you can actually feel this. This is, again, why I keep going on about the sensitivity to the body. You can actually feel this: the heart centre opening and closing. It may not be that dramatic, so we may not be talking about colossal differences of opening and closing, but just little movements, and notice the relationship with clinging. Why did the Buddha go on and on and on and on about clinging? Clinging brings suffering. Clinging closes the heart. Releasing clinging brings freedom; it also brings love. And we can notice this so we're crystal clear about it, and there's just no arguing about it. It's very, very clear to us. We feel it in the heart and in the body. | <span class="blockid">8-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#When there's clinging the heart closes when the clinging goes the heart centre opens\|When there's clinging, the heart closes, when the clinging goes, the heart centre opens]]<br/><hr class="cell">As I mentioned in one of the talks, can also begin to notice something with clinging. So 'clinging' meaning constricting ourselves around something, pushing something away because we don't like it, because it's unpleasant, pulling it towards us. 'Clinging' - that whole thing. Can notice: when the clinging is there, what happens to the heart? So just to notice this. It's like an experiment. When there's clinging, the heart closes, sometimes just a little bit. And you can actually feel that. Sometimes just to put the awareness in the centre of the chest area, just very lightly, and notice: when there's clinging there, there's a slight closing, or a large closing. When the clinging goes, the heart centre opens. Just to notice that. |

By 'clinging,' I mean pushing away what we don't like, over-identifying with things, trying to hold on to things, to grasp at things - all that is clinging. And we can begin to feel that and see this relationship, as I said, with the heart. And that when we release the clinging, the heart opens and love comes. And we can develop over time - it's a gradual process - but we can develop our capacity to become sensitive to when there's clinging around. | <span class="blockid">8-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Doing metta with the awareness of whether there's clinging\|Doing metta with the awareness of whether there's clinging]]<br/><hr class="cell">So another possibility is to be doing the mettā practice or the compassion practice when we move to it, to be in the moment doing that, again, broaden the attention a little bit, and just be aware of if there is clinging to anything - to a body sensation, to a sound, pushing it away, struggling with something, to an emotion, whatever, to a train of thought. Is there clinging there? And if there is, is it possible to actually just relax and release that clinging? And in so doing, the heart opens. So to be doing the mettā practice with actually a slightly larger sense of awareness that's aware of whether there's clinging or not and just releasing. Just keep releasing the clinging as a way of opening the heart. |
| <span class="blockid">11-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Clinging has an enormous range to it\|Clinging has an enormous range to it]]<br/><hr class="cell">So sometimes clinging is extremely obvious. You know, we're literally hanging on to someone's leg: "Don't go! Don't leave me! Don't _leave_ me!" [laughter] This is very obvious. Or, you know, "If you go, I'm going to jump out of the window" or whatever. [laughter] It's obvious that clinging is there. But clinging has an enormous range to it. Again, like all these Dharma questions, it gets extremely subtle, extremely subtle. Part of the good news is that we can develop the subtlety of our sensitivity and be more and more aware of when clinging is there. |  |
| <span class="blockid">11-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#The body sense will indicate when there's clinging around\|The body sense will indicate when there's clinging around]]<br/><hr class="cell">Again, why do we keep going on about the sensitivity to the body? Because in this sensitivity to this region of energy, this energy field, this feeling field, as I develop the sensitivity to that, as I keep the sensitivity and the awareness there, that body sense will reflect to me, will indicate to me when there's clinging around - holding, pushing, struggling, identifying - because some kind of contraction and tension comes into the bodily experience, even if it's very subtle. Even if it's very subtle - in the belly, in the shoulders, in the back, just very, very, subtly in the whole body experience - and that can be our indicator of when there's clinging. And sometimes - even better news - we don't even know what we're clinging to, but just the releasing of the body, the relaxing of the body sense, can release the clinging and open the heart. | <span class="blockid">8-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#The body will reflect when clinging is around\|The body will reflect when clinging is around]]<br/><hr class="cell">So that's, in itself, a practice to do that. The way in usually is to have, again, this sensitivity to the whole body, a subtle sense, a sensitivity to the subtle sort of sense of the whole body. That subtle sense of the body will reflect when clinging is around. It will cramp up or constrict, sometimes in very subtle ways. Can pick up on that in the slightly broader awareness as one's doing the mettā and just relax it. In so doing, the clinging relaxes, the struggle relaxes, and the heart opens. |

And just to be aware, **use the body sense to be aware: "Is there clinging right now? Am I pushing, pulling, struggling with things, experience, in the moment? If there is, can I relax that clinging, let go of it, relax the body, relax the clinging?" See what happens to the love.** Again, it can kick-start the _mettā_ when it feels blocked, or like it's not really getting anywhere off the ground in any moment. Or it can deepen it. And one can actually - all of these, one can stay with them and let the _mettā_ deepen with them and through them. | <span class="blockid">9-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Dukkha depends on the struggle of the push and pull\|Dukkha depends on the struggle of the push and pull]]<br/><hr class="cell">When there's a push and pull of clinging, we're pushing away what we don't like, what's unpleasant, or pulling towards ourselves what we want, what's pleasant, when that's going on there is suffering with what's pleasant or unpleasant. That's the insight of this characteristic. That's the insight of dukkha. The suffering depends not on the thing. It depends on the struggle, on the push or the pull. To feel this and to see it. When there's push and pull there, there's constriction, there's suffering. When we relax that, there is release, there's ease. And you can feel this. And there's also love. There's also love in the absence of clinging. |
| <span class="blockid">11-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#The self-sense is dependent on clinging\|The self-sense is dependent on clinging]]<br/><hr class="cell">Clinging - pushing away what we don't like, pulling towards us and grasping on what we do like - as I said the other day, that builds the self-sense. So the self-sense is dependent on clinging, and clinging is actually dependent on the self-sense. They're mutually dependent. The more self-sense, the more other-sense. Self and other go together - the more separation, the less love. See how this all fits together, and why the Buddha just kept going on and on about this stuff? | <span class="blockid">9-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#With more open space with metta the actual sense of self quietens\|With more open space with metta, the actual sense of self quietens]]<br/><hr class="cell">But as I mentioned the other day, the self, the self-sense, the ego-sense, is empty. It doesn't exist by itself, of its own steam, of its own support. It actually depends on struggling with something, on clinging, on pushing away or pulling. It needs that food. And we can see: as we're in this more open space with the mettā, let go of some clinging if you feel it, if it's possible. Just relax that, the body sense, relax the clinging. The actual sense of self quietens, and the quietening of the sense of self, the quietening of the sense of separation from other, because self and other go together. Less separation, more love. So that would be working on the dukkha angle to come into the anattā, seeing that the self is actually dependent on pushing and pulling. It's empty. |
| <span class="blockid">11-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#3 Anatta not-self\|(3) Anatta, not-self]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(3)** So there's _anicca_, 'impermanence,' _dukkha_, 'unsatisfactoriness' or 'suffering,' or how suffering arises through clinging, and the last one is **_anattā_**. So to say a bit about this, this **'not-self'** teaching - it's really, really important to realize that, in Dharma practice, we're not setting out to destroy the self, to explode the self, to erase the self, even to dissolve the self or to merge the sense of self with some cosmic being or cosmic sense of something. The other day I mentioned oneness in the talk, and the possibility of this sense of oneness. And sometimes there _can_ be a sense of the being opening and merging with something and a real sense of oneness. That's really beautiful, really precious, and really, really helpful. But it's still - it's a little bit different from this _anattā_ business. It's extremely valuable, if and when it happens, to open to that, and have that change of perception, and feel the beauty of that, and feel touched by that. But _anattā_ is something different, and it's _not_ that that is what we're going for in understanding _anattā_. | <span class="blockid">9-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#We are neither aiming to dissolve the self nor merge with the One\|We are neither aiming to dissolve the self nor merge with the One]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(3)** And then we can go into the not-self in a more direct way, this **anattā** in a more direct way, the third characteristic in a more direct way. This is important to understand: we're not trying to destroy the self, like ego destruction, or get rid of the self, or dissolve it in some way, or even merge it into some cosmic sense of something. Sometimes, and in really deep practice, there _can_ be a sense of just merging into a oneness or merging into a kind of infinite love. And at very deep levels, that's possible. That possibility is a treasure. It's something really to be valued and explored in very deep practice. But it's not quite the same as anattā, what we're aiming for, valuable as it is. Rather, we want to understand something. We want to understand something about this self, and understand it in a way that it brings freedom. |
| <span class="blockid">12-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We want to understand something about what the self is and how it is in a way that brings freedom into our life\|We want to understand something about what the self is, and how it is, in a way that brings freedom into our life]]<br/><hr class="cell">_Anattā_ is, really, we want to understand something about the nature of the self, understand it in a way that brings freedom. We want to understand something about what the self is, and how it is, in a way that brings freedom into our life. So going back to fear for a second, fear is based on this self-notion. Without belief in the self, there can't really be fear. Where is the fear going to take root? It's around self. When we begin to understand, deeply and in the heart, this emptiness of self, we realize there's actually nothing real here to protect, to defend, to worry about, and fear gets released at a very deep level in our lives. | <span class="blockid">9-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Understanding anatta takes time\|Understanding anatta takes time]]<br/><hr class="cell">And it's difficult - it takes time to understand this concept of anattā. It's not something that comes easy or simple. Even if we can kind of get it intellectually, to really get it at a heart level where it's making a difference to our lives is something that takes time. Absolutely, it takes time. So not to worry that, "Oh, I'm not understanding this yet" or whatever. It really takes time, anattā. Or "What a terrible practice I have because I don't understand it yet." |
| <span class="blockid">12-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Anatta is difficult to grasp fully\|Anatta is difficult to grasp fully]]<br/><hr class="cell">So we want to understand something about self, and it's actually not easy to understand, this teaching of _anattā_. It's really not easy. I've never encountered anyone who gets it right away. And even if one can get it intellectually very quickly, it takes a long time for the heart and the being to absorb that understanding in a way that's bringing freedom. So it's tantalizing as a teaching. We hear it, and we sort of get it, and we want to understand it, and we get frustrated sometimes. Sometimes we grab hold of the understanding in a bit of the wrong way. |  |

And in that way of looking comes freedom and comes love. And it's really a practice. Again, in this buffet, some of you will be familiar with some of these ways already from particular ways you've approached insight meditation.

He wants you to practise a way of looking. We _can_ **practise a way of looking - regarding our experience as 'not me' and 'not mine,' 'not-self.'** So typically, typical human consciousness, something comes up, something comes into our experience - a thought, an emotion, a body sensation - and we regard it, without even thinking about it, oftentimes, without even realizing that we're doing it, sometimes, we regard it as 'me': "I _am_ that emotion. That's _how I am_. That's _who_ I am." Or 'mine': "That thought belongs to me. This body sensation belongs to me. This body belongs to me." The whole range of it, we identify, either identify or take ownership of. This is going on 99.9 per cent of the time of our waking and dreaming life. An incredible current of habitually identifying with, taking as 'me' or 'mine' our experience, and particularly the five aggregates which John talked about: **(_a_)** the **body**, **(_b_)** the **feeling-tone** of experience, pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, **(_c_)** our **perceptions**, **(_d_)** the whole range of our **mental thoughts and formations**, and moods and mind states and emotions, and **(_e_)** the **consciousness** itself, the awareness itself. | <span class="blockid">10-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#With anatta we are working with the "me-mine" experience\|With anatta we are working with the "me-mine" experience]]<br/><hr class="cell">So with the anattā, again, practising ways of looking that lead to freedom, that lead to release, and that lead to love. With anattā, working with it directly, it's a way of looking at experience. Usually we look at experience, a thought comes up, either we're completely identified with it and we say it's 'me' or it's 'mine.' Or a body sensation is there, it's 'me' or 'mine.' Or an emotion, 'me' or 'mine.' Sometimes we're actually conscious that we're doing that. We're conscious that we're saying, "Yeah, of course it's me and mine. Of course it's my knee. Who the hell else's knee is it?!" [laughter] Or, "Of course it's my thought." Sometimes it's very conscious. Most of the time, it goes on without us even being aware of it. We're just saying me-mine, me-mine, me-mine, me-mine - virtually uninterrupted throughout our life. |
| <span class="blockid">13-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Look at experience through a lens of "it's just happening"\|Look at experience through a lens of "it's just happening"]]<br/><hr class="cell">And - sometimes deliberately, sometimes we realize we're doing it; most of the time we don't - we're saying, "Me. Mine. This is me. This is mine." And the Buddha is saying, can you practise - it's a gradual thing to develop this practice - can you practise seeing it in the moment, as 'not me, not mine'? So a body sensation comes up, and it's 'just happening.' A thought comes up and it's 'just happening.' It's 'not me, not mine.' And one learns to actually look at the experience through a lens - instead of the lens of 'me, mine, me, mine, me, mine' - **look at the experience through a lens of 'it's just happening, it's not me, it's not mine.'** It's a practice. And again, what happens? It may seem paradoxical. What happens? Freedom and love are liberated in that way of relating. I'm talking about very real possibilities for practice. And again, for those with that experience or have got that way of practising already, you can drop that in as a backdrop for the _mettā_ practice. So you open the awareness up and just regard things as 'just happening,' as 'not me, not mine,' and into the experience comes more love. | <span class="blockid">10-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#"Just unhook" is not a metaphysical statement\|"Just unhook" is not a metaphysical statement]]<br/><hr class="cell">So what the Buddha is saying is not so much a sense of making a philosophical statement: "There is a self" or "There isn't a self." And actually, he tended to ignore that question, said it's not the appropriate question. He'd say, rather, can you practise in a certain way? And that way is, can you look at the present moment experience and actually just unhook the 'me' and 'mine'? So 'me' and 'mine' goes and puts its hook of identification into everything. And all the difficulty and all the problem that comes out of that. He says, can you just unhook and regard the moment's experience, the body sensation, the thought, the emotion, whatever it is, as not me, not mine? So he's not making any metaphysical statement about the nature of self or no self or whatever. He's pointing to a way of practising that leads to freedom. And it really is a practice. It takes some time. |
| <span class="blockid">13-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Self-judgement\|Self-judgement]]<br/><hr class="cell">One of the particular areas where we get entangled, and certainly on a meditation retreat, is self-judgment. So something comes up for us, or our practice feels difficult, or we're sitting here doing _mettā_, and then we get irritation, or aversion, or some negative thoughts, and we judge that. We judge ourselves, and we measure ourselves: "How am I doing? How is my practice going?" Very normal. That measuring and judging and comparing is actually part of the nature of what self does. The way self builds itself is through judging, measuring, comparing, and evaluating. | <span class="blockid">10-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#The comparing judging mind\|The comparing, judging mind]]<br/><hr class="cell">So again, a number of people have mentioned, and it's very common because it's very human, a kind of judging mind come in. And often it's judging of ourselves. And the comparing mind comes into, in this case, the retreat situation. In a way, a retreat is just a mirror of what goes on in our lives; it's just we're seeing a bit more closely the kinds of thoughts that we have anyway, the comparing, the judging. |
| <span class="blockid">13-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#With metta you take away the energy from the pattern of self-judging\|With metta you take away the energy from the pattern of self-judging]]<br/><hr class="cell">So to recognize that it's going to be part of the experience. It's going to be part of the experience. The question is, how can I relate to it in a way that's most helpful? That's a whole other subject, but first of all, one of the ways is just to keep doing the _mettā_. And realize that we have a habit of judging, of measuring ourselves, of comparing, of evaluating, and just to keep doing the _mettā_ is taking away the energy from that habit pattern and feeding what's more helpful: the _mettā_, _mettā_ to our self. But also, sometimes, to just see that these thoughts that we're judging, or this state of mind, it's like they arise out of nowhere. They're 'just happening.' They're 'not me, not mine.' We take them to be 'me' or 'mine.' They're like a shooting star in the sky, in the night sky: it just appears out of nowhere and then disappears. The more we can begin to see things that way, the less identification, and the less dragged down we are in self-judgment, self-criticism, comparing, measuring, evaluating ourselves. So this is really a practice that we can develop. | <span class="blockid">10-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#The self-sense gets its energy from measuring comparing judging\|The self-sense gets its energy from measuring, comparing, judging]]<br/><hr class="cell">So we're sitting here, and we think, "God, I bet that everyone else is probably in the 134th jhāna by now." [laughter] "And I'm still struggling away with the hindrances" or whatever. Or, "Actually, they're probably all enlightened, and they could probably all go home. They're just staying so that I don't feel too bad." [laughter] Or whatever. This is very common, you know. And often it's us we put down, or it's others. You know, it's others, and we look at someone, and we say, "Call yourself a meditator?" or whatever. It comes in either way. It's the same deal. Comparing, measurement, judgment - this is part of what the self-sense is. It's like the other side of the coin of the self-sense. It's what self-sense does. In a way, it _has_ to do it. Self, you could say self feeds on measurement. It gets its _oomph_ and its energy from measuring, from comparing, from judging. That's how it actually creates a separation between this and that, "This is me, and that isn't." And it does it by comparing, by measuring. To establish a difference between self and other, I need to compare, I need to judge. So it's woven very tightly into the fabric of what self-sense is and what it is to be human, really. And woven into ignorance. |

So judgment thoughts, comparing thoughts, they're thoughts. And there's a certain groove that the mind gets into, comparing, judging. Mettā is another thought. And gradually, one way of looking at what we're doing is establishing another groove, a much more wholesome and helpful groove to the mind, that's actually about connection and acceptance and kindness, not judgment, not comparison. Slowly, over time, the groove of mettā will be more established than the groove of comparison and judgment and measurement. And that's a real possibility. In the moment when comparison is happening, to kick the mettā practice in, to inject a bit more energy into the mettā practice is also helpful, because it's like using the thinking that's already going on, and just saying, "I'll use the thinking energy because it's already going on, but I'll use it in a wholesome way. And I'll just plug away at that until the comparing and all that begins to lose energy." So really to trust the power of the mettā practice, and the compassion as we get on to it. |
|  | <span class="blockid">11-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Judgement thoughts are not me not mine\|Judgement thoughts are not me, not mine]]<br/><hr class="cell">At a deeper level, though, the judgment thoughts, again, they're not me, not mine. It's like thoughts are just arising out of nowhere and disappearing back into nowhere. It's like having a radio on a very bad radio station, that's just putting out these thoughts. They're not me, not mine. The more, in time, we can practise seeing our thoughts that way, the more freeing. And we can really have a freedom from judgment in life, a freedom from believing or being involved in any of that stuff. Nothing that I'm talking about today is abstract. I'm talking about very real possibilities. It's completely possible for everyone in this room to be totally free of judgment, self-judgment, of the comparing mind, of the measuring mind. It's a very real possibility of practice. |

So again, you're doing the mettā, you can just, if you have a little skill already in this area, or if it already seems to be happening, experiment. You're doing the mettā, you're doing the compassion. A bit more space. What else is happening? Body sensation, thought, whatever, just seeing it as 'not me, not mine.' Including the awareness, because we also will then have an identification with awareness, which is a more subtle identification. We can let go of that identification. And that emptiness that opens up will be imbued with love. If it's not imbued with love, something's a little bit off balance with the practice, a little bit barking up the wrong tree. So with these three characteristics, one of the indicators that they're working properly is that they bring freedom and love, and not a sense of coldness and disconnection or fear, as I said before. |

So again, you're directing the _mettā_ to another being, and just say, "_Their_ body doesn't belong to them. Their feelings, their emotions, their thoughts, their consciousness - it's all ownerless. It's just stuff happening, stuff arising." And again, you get this sense of not much of a giver of love, not much of a receiver of love, and yet it deepens it, can deepen it. | <span class="blockid">11-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[From Insight to Love#Others' experience is also "no me not mine"\|Others' experience is also "no me, not mine"]]<br/><hr class="cell">And similarly, it's actually possible to direct the mettā, the compassion, towards other, another person, and actually regard _them_ as, whatever is happening, their experience is 'not me, not mine' in their case. What we call their 'aggregates,' what the Buddha called 'aggregates,' what makes up their experience, is also not belonging to anyone. You would think, "Well, who is there to give love to?" But somehow, it's possible that that actually just opens up a whole other level of love. |
