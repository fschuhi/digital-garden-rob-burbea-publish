| <span class="blockid">1-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Today we add the compassion to the self\|Today we add the compassion to the self]]<br/><hr class="cell">I was perhaps a little even more long-winded than usual last night, and as a result there were a couple of things I left out, which I just want to touch on today. Today we add the self, compassion to the self. So we keep compassion to the person who is obviously suffering, and we add compassion to the self. I'm going to speak a bit about that, which should have gone in the talk last night had I not been so long-winded. Actually, there's an old Jewish proverb that says, "Why say something in twenty words when you can say it in two thousand?" [laughter]<br/><hr class="cell"><span style="color:red">2007 9-3 to 10-4 is part of [[The Practice of Compassion]], see also [[Synopsis 4]]</span> |  |
| <span class="blockid">1-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#"It seems unfair to give compassion to myself others suffer much more!"\|"It seems unfair to give compassion to myself, others suffer much more!"]]<br/><hr class="cell">When we move on to compassion for the self, very, very common, this is very common: we've just been with someone obviously suffering, and the feeling that comes up or the reaction that comes up, and it's understandable, can be, "But I look at myself, and I just see others in the world are suffering much more. I'm aware of my suffering, but when I compare that to the suffering that I know of in the world, that I read about, that I hear about, it seems unfair to stay with myself and give the compassion to myself." This is extremely common. | <span class="blockid">9-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#When there's metta and compassion for oneself the ego can take its rightful place in the scheme of things\|When there's metta and compassion for oneself, the ego can take its rightful place in the scheme of things]]<br/><hr class="cell">Okay, now the other morning, I talked briefly about compassion to oneself. And again, just reflecting how common it is for us to feel, "Well, there's so much suffering in the world, and I really don't suffer much compared to - I open the newspaper, and I see what's going on wherever it is, in Sudan or wherever." But it's hugely important to give the compassion to oneself, and it's not building ego. You might think, "Well, I'm spending all this time giving to myself. Isn't that just pumping up my ego in some way?" Ego gets pumped up through the _wrong_ kind of attention to oneself, actually through _lack_ of self-love. When there's the lack of self-love, then the ego has to go out and make itself big in the world, and make itself this or that. When there's mettā and compassion for oneself, the ego can just take its rightful place in the scheme of things. And it's tremendously healing, just that simplicity of the compassion practice to ourself. How healing that is to bathe ourselves, our lives, our bodies, our minds, in compassion. |
| <span class="blockid">1-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Story leprosy community in Indea\|Story: leprosy community in Indea]]<br/><hr class="cell">I remember taking a month with some Dharma friends, and working at a leprosy community in India, and having a long conversation on the long train trip down from Delhi with a friend. And she had done a lot of service work from a very young age, and was sort of saying that service was really much more needed in the Third World, etc., and it was pointless relating to sort of white middle-class people in the West, etc. But we had a long conversation, and then going to this leprosy community and actually seeing how much joy there was there - it was quite striking. People with leprosy, and recovering from leprosy, or having recovered from leprosy - a tremendous amount of joy there. And we had this sort of ongoing conversation and comparing that to some of the suffering that's around in the West. I really don't want to polarize East and West here, but sometimes where we think the suffering is isn't always where it is, in the most obvious sense. And anyway, suffering is not measurable. This is something we'll come back to. But suffering is not measurable. |  |
| <span class="blockid">1-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#This suffering here is the one we can be most intimate with\|This suffering here is the one we can be most intimate with]]<br/><hr class="cell">But this reaction, "Others suffer much more" - extremely common. Sometimes it's just a habitual way of viewing, a habitual way of seeing ourselves and thinking. There's something - well, there are a lot of things really crucial about compassion to the self. One of them is that this suffering here is the suffering that we can be most intimate with. And because of that, there's the potential that we can actually learn most from it, in terms of, how does suffering arise? Remember, that's the fundamental question of insight, of _paññā_, of wisdom. So because we're most intimate with this psychophysical organism, that's where we learn the most. And that wisdom then translates and transfers into compassion for others, because we understand the roots of suffering. The more we understand the roots of suffering, the more compassion there can be for all beings. |  |
| <span class="blockid">1-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Compassion for oneself is tremendously healing\|Compassion for oneself is tremendously healing]]<br/><hr class="cell">Compassion for oneself - tremendously healing. Really, really important levels of healing there. And it comes in lots of different ways. It comes, of course, through _mettā_ to ourselves, through compassion to ourselves, but also through the _samādhi_, to whatever extent it's there. Just the calming of the body, the calming of the mind, brings a healing. I can actually feel a healing going on sometimes. And also through insight, as I just said. | <br/><hr class="cell"><span style="color:red">also</span> [[The Practice of Compassion#When there's metta and compassion for oneself the ego can take its rightful place in the scheme of things\|When there's metta and compassion for oneself, the ego can take its rightful place in the scheme of things]] |
| <span class="blockid">2-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#There's also enjoyment in compassion practice\|There's also enjoyment in compassion practice]]<br/><hr class="cell">So this practice of compassion and compassion to oneself - you can actually enjoy it. And like I said last night, it doesn't have to be always heavy. Sometimes it feels, you know, the heart is reverberating with empathy, and it can feel - not heavy, but just poignant, definitely. But there's also an enjoyment in compassion practice that's available. And that enjoyment is very much part of the healing, as much as the being moved and the being touched. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Balance of empathy and giving is so important\|Balance of empathy and giving is so important]]<br/><hr class="cell">This aspect, and I mentioned it, I think - well, definitely last night, and maybe even before - this balancing of the empathy and the giving, this is so important. Do I need to go over it again? I'm really happy to explain it again if people are not quite sure what that means yet. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#"Sympathy" in English has connotations of pity\|"Sympathy" in English has connotations of pity]]<br/><hr class="cell">**Rob**: Okay, maybe that's right. Thank you, Frances. Maybe in English usage of the word 'sympathy' has come to mean something which evokes a sense of pity, which has a sense of distance and somewhat looking down. I don't know whether it originally meant that. Just, you know, 'sym-pathy' - it doesn't imply that. But it's probably come to have been injected a little bit with that. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Biblical origin of "pity"\|Biblical origin of "pity"]]<br/><hr class="cell">**Yogi 3**: I was wondering about our look at this word 'pity,' whether that's something to do with a Western approach rather than the original maybe biblical terms. May have _been_ compassion, but we've interpreted it as something from a distance, you know, something we look at from a distance. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-8</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#"Pity" points to being a bit distant aloof\|"Pity" points to being a bit distant, aloof]]<br/><hr class="cell">**Rob**: Yeah, very possibly. Yeah, and probably originally the word meant something much more like compassion. But that feeling might still have arisen for people. And so I just want to use words to separate out what one might notice in one's practice when one's a bit distant, a bit aloof, a bit almost superior. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-9</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Feeling in the body the loveliness of giving is a way to make the compassion sustainable\|Feeling in the body the loveliness of giving is a way to make the compassion sustainable]]<br/><hr class="cell">But this piece about balancing our empathy, how we're resonating, how we're feeling the suffering, opening to it, taking it in, and balancing that with the giving out. And tasting, feeling in the body the loveliness of what we give out as a way of making the compassion sustainable. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-10</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Different from insight practice in compassion practice one is more interest in what is around the pain not in the center of it\|Different from insight practice, in compassion practice one is more interest in what is around the pain, not in the center of it]]<br/><hr class="cell">When we come to compassion for our self, in a way, this balance and this process still applies. Usually in insight practice, when we have a pain - emotional or physical or mental, whatever it is - the instructions, part of the instructions, are to really go into the pain, and really feel it in a very bare way, open oneself to it, get into the texture of it, be right there with it. And so, quite standard insight meditation instructions - very useful, very powerful, very beautiful. Slightly different emphasis with compassion to oneself, in that one is aware of the pain, whatever it is - emotional hurt, physical pain, whatever - but it's almost as if that's at the centre of something. And one is conscious of it. One's feeling it. One's even feeling the suffering of it. But in a way, one's more interested in what's _around_ that, in the - someone in their note, beautifully put - the _holding_ that goes _around_ the pain. So it's as if this pain is at the centre. And we're not denying it. We're still feeling it, but we're not going right into it. We're more interested in the warmth and the tenderness and the holding that's around it. And the attention is a little bit more even in that. So it's, again, picking up on this quality of what's bathing, what's giving, what's going out. |  |
| <span class="blockid">3-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Compassion to self does not build the ego\|Compassion to self does not build the ego]]<br/><hr class="cell">Another issue that can come up when we give either _mettā_ or compassion to myself is the question, "Am I feeding my ego? If I spend too long just relating to myself with love and compassion, am I perhaps feeding the ego and feeding this sense of self?" Good question. But when we look carefully, we actually see that the ego-sense is dependent on the _wrong_ kind of attention to the self - on an obsession, or judgmentalism, or criticism, or that kind of thing. A wrong kind of self-attention feeds, builds the ego and builds the self-sense, whereas an attention that's full of compassion, full of tenderness, full of acceptance and care, full of insight into questioning, "How is it that this suffering has come about?" - that kind of direction of the attention towards self does not build the ego, will not build the ego, will actually soften things, will actually allow things to become looser and more spacious. | <br/><hr class="cell"><span style="color:red">also</span> [[The Practice of Compassion#When there's metta and compassion for oneself the ego can take its rightful place in the scheme of things\|When there's metta and compassion for oneself, the ego can take its rightful place in the scheme of things]] |
| <span class="blockid">3-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Compassion is a lighter energy than metta so phrases can be used more lightly\|Compassion is a lighter energy than metta, so phrases can be used more lightly]]<br/><hr class="cell">And as I said before, when there's a lack of self-love, we tend to look out for nourishment. We look outwards, in a way, too much, in an off-balance way. And somehow that actually _also_ feeds the self. So there's a basic practice for compassion to oneself: just using the phrases, using the intention, feeling that energy. And just a word here in response to someone's note, actually, to repeat something I said: compassion, I feel - not everyone will feel this, but some people will definitely feel this - compassion is a lighter energy. It _can_ be a little more subtle. So what that might mean is you might want to really back off on the phrases. Some people don't want to use any phrases at all with compassion, because it's more delicate. Some people just use the phrases much more lightly, and this allows the sense of drawing close to the suffering, of empathy, and also of giving. So play with that. Play with how heavily and tightly you hold the phrases. |  |
| <span class="blockid">3-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Two more possibilities\|Two more possibilities]]<br/><hr class="cell">Okay, so there's the basic practice of compassion to oneself and all the lovely healing, the beauty of the healing that's involved in that. There are two more possibilities I just want to put out there. Again, some of you will be interested, and some, it's fine to just let these go. But I want to put them out. |  |
| <span class="blockid">3-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#1 Use the climate of compassion as a lense\|(1) Use the climate of compassion as a lense]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(1)** Sometimes we're directing the compassion towards our self, and we're actually not feeling much suffering in that moment. There's nothing particularly dramatic going on. There's no big suffering in the here and now. But **because of the practice, there can be a _climate_ of compassion**. It's as if there's a softness and tenderness come into the inner climate, and some degree of _samādhi_, of settling - it doesn't have to be a big deal - some degree of settling. And perhaps one's gone down to one word or one phrase and just really simplified and lightened the practice. There's no particular, dramatic suffering, but something quite powerful is potentially possible here. You can **use that whole climate and the practice as a kind of lens to look at one's experience in the moment, and to see any kind of suffering, any kind of subtle suffering, and to unhook it**. | <span class="blockid">9-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Cultivating a climate of compassion\|Cultivating a climate of compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">And then, as I mentioned briefly the other day, and just to mention them briefly, possibilities of other, sort of more _insight_ openings through compassion to oneself. When we're doing the compassion to oneself, and there's not a particularly strong suffering there - so not when there's really a lot of something difficult going on; one's just going about in one's usual, humdrum meditative day. [laughter] And there's nothing particularly dramatic going on. I'm in the here and now, giving compassion to myself, and I'm just not too absorbed in the feeling of compassion. So it's _there_, maybe, or just the phrases are there, or whatever, but there's a little bit more wideness to include what I see, and the sounds, and what I'm feeling emotionally, and the thoughts and the body sensations. Just a little bit more wideness. There's a climate of compassion, and some degree of samādhi, which may mean that the phrases have got very sparse, or not using the phrases, or it's just one word or whatever. |
| <span class="blockid">3-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#The lens of compassion is used to tune into any subtle manifestation of suffering\|The lens of compassion is used to tune into any subtle manifestation of suffering]]<br/><hr class="cell">So one's actually using a kind of insight practice through the lens of compassion, in a way that the lens of compassion is tuning one into any subtle manifestation of suffering. And what can happen because of the compassion is one sees these subtle sufferings, and it just unhooks organically. One sees what one's doing, what one's clinging to right there and then, and it just can unhook it - because there's this attunement to suffering, because of the compassion practice. And there's a natural letting go, can be a natural letting go. | <span class="blockid">9-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Looking at the present experience through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering\|Looking at the present experience, through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering]]<br/><hr class="cell">In that climate of compassion, with a little bit more broad awareness, it's like a lens of looking at the present moment, the present experience, through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering, in the moment. So we begin to see little sufferings, little ways that we're creating suffering. And organically somehow, because of the compassion practice, we can just unhook. It just unhooks. _We_ don't really need to do it; it's just organically unhooked. You _may_ find this. You may find it. |
|  | <span class="blockid">10-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#We feel the contraction in the climate of compassion\|We feel the contraction in the climate of compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">We become conscious of what we're clinging to in the moment. And it could be, "Oh, when is this walking period going to end?" It could be we actually feel ourselves, the consciousness, move out of the here and now, and we feel with it the kind of contraction and the subtle suffering of that, in the climate of compassion, in the awareness. And it just, "May you be free." And we realize where the freedom is. It's _not_ from moving out of the here and now. And we let go of that impulse. Or we may just realize the heart is closed down a bit, and that's not where the freedom is, that's not where the healing is. And it's almost like we're not really thinking about it. It's just happening. And the heart can open again when we see it. There can be a natural letting go there. Or something we're grasping at, or we're aware of how we're building things with the self-story. So there's actually some suffering, and then we're piling on, you know, decades of history and decades of future, and mother and father and grandparents and everything. It's all piled on there, and suddenly we've got this huge conglomerate of suffering. And we're actually seeing that in the moment: "Oh, this is what I'm doing." And I'm saying, "May you be free," and we see the freedom is actually just to let go of that, and just to be with the pain - which is probably considerably less than this whole mass of built-up stuff. |
| <span class="blockid">4-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Somehow in the seeing and the softness it just unhooks\|Somehow in the seeing and the softness, it just unhooks]]<br/><hr class="cell">This can be a very, very beautiful and powerful way of practising. It tends to kind of consolidate whatever insights we've already had. So one might have - I mean, it can be anything - just the insight that when I get too involved in story, and I build up my suffering through the story, I'm actually creating more suffering. We've all seen how consciousness can do that. We get too - we drag in the past and the future and the story, and we build suffering. So in this climate of compassion, relatively calm, one sees the beginnings of that. And somehow in the seeing and the softness, it just unhooks. It just unhooks. | <span class="blockid">10-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Giving compassion to oneself can consolidate any insight practice\|Giving compassion to oneself can consolidate any insight practice]]<br/><hr class="cell">But it could be any level of insight. So, you know, it could be one's been working with emptiness a lot, and one sees: "Oh, I've just, I've moved back into making things seem really real. I'm out of the emptiness." Or "I'm giving things solidity in time." Whatever it is. Doesn't matter. This way of practising can have a way of, I feel, kind of consolidating whatever insight feels fresh. So we feel like, you know, you're on retreat, and I'm understanding this or that about how suffering gets created, and this way of practising can actually keep it being used, keep it active, keep it fresh, consolidate it. |
| <span class="blockid">4-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#This way there is a bit more openness in the compassion practice\|This way there is a bit more openness in the compassion practice]]<br/><hr class="cell">It consolidates our previous insights of seeing that story-building is _usually_, not always, but usually unhelpful. Or could be just we sense we've moved out of the here and now, we've moved out of an immediate presence. So in this way of using compassion practice, there's a bit more openness to what's actually going on in the moment. It's not just tunnelled into the phrases in the compassion. It's a bit more open, and the compassion is embracing the experience in the moment. Could be we just sense we've closed down, the heart's just closed, and we don't need to. And again, the climate allows it to open. Or we feel we're grasping at something. And we're just aware of the grasping. And again, the lens of compassion sees it and can just let it go. But it can be any range of insights. Identification - we see that we're identified with something. If one has the practice, we see, "Ah, I'm not seeing the emptiness of something. I'm believing in something's inherent existence, whatever it is" - can be a whole range of subtlety here. It's all there, possible. |  |
| <span class="blockid">4-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Beautiful mix of insight and compassion practice\|Beautiful mix of insight and compassion practice]]<br/><hr class="cell">So again, just putting this out as a possibility. As a way of practice, it's actually a very beautiful kind of mix of insight practice and compassion practice, very lovely way to go about doing insight practice, and a way of deepening and expanding the compassion practice. |  |
| <span class="blockid">4-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#2 Compassion to self is compassion to mind moments\|(2) Compassion to self is compassion to mind moments]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(2)** Second possibility - and it's just a possibility - giving the compassion to the self, and as the calming deepens or in moments of calmness, we look inside at what we're giving the compassion to, and it can sometimes seem, or sometimes becomes clear, that this is really **compassion to mind moments**. So when I give compassion to myself and there's suffering - big suffering or little suffering - what I'm really encountering is moments of mind, moments of awareness with something going on in them. Not a self - I don't ever encounter a self. What I encounter is moments of mind with something happening in that mind moment, moments of awareness. Or you could say the self that I encounter is just really mind moments. It's just mind moments. | <span class="blockid">10-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Seeing mind moments of experience\|Seeing mind moments of experience]]<br/><hr class="cell">So that's one possibility, and you don't have to go anywhere near that if you don't feel like it, but I'm just putting it out there. And the second one that I mentioned the other day was also: compassion to self, there's some degree of calming that happens, and in the calmness there's a little more sense of just inner space. And I begin to see - don't even ask - "Who is this self I'm giving the compassion to?" And I just see mind moments of experience. A moment of an emotion, a moment of a thought, a moment of a sight, a moment of a feeling, a moment of whatever it is - suffering, a moment of ease. That's all I can find, mind moments. I actually can't find anything else. |
| <span class="blockid">4-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#This frees up the sense of self which frees up more compassion\|This frees up the sense of self, which frees up more compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">What this can do, what it _does_ do when we see this, is it frees up the sense of self. Again, instead of a solid sense of self - my independent, fixed, solid self - it frees it up in a way that's very spacious, can be very spacious. And in so doing, it frees up more compassion. The more spacious this sense of self, the more compassion. And once we've seen that in ourselves, we can actually do that to another. So we're giving compassion to someone else. Who am I giving compassion to? There's no one there. It's just mind moments, with something happening in the mind moment. | <span class="blockid">10-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Giving compassion to mind moments\|Giving compassion to mind moments]]<br/><hr class="cell">And so the compassion practice, as it calms, can begin to feel like I'm just actually giving compassion to these mind moments. There's nothing else there. There's a mind moment, and it's being touched with compassion. So this really does begin to free up the sense of self, and free up the compassion with it. Less sense of self, more compassion. And then we can take that level of insight and actually do it the same with others. I see there's nothing _here_ but mind moments, nothing _there_ but mind moments. We give compassion to someone else and, again, the calming, we see: "I'm just giving compassion to their mind moments" - in a way, their _ownerless_ mind moments. There's no owner. They're just mind moments arising. Can give a real sense of softness and space, and emptiness, too, in the practice. This is bringing the anattā in. |
| <span class="blockid">4-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Giving compassion to ownerless mind moments\|Giving compassion to ownerless mind moments]]<br/><hr class="cell">So in a way, we're giving compassion to ownerless mind moments, mind moments that have no owner. This is another way into the _anattā_, this not-self business. And the paradox is there: the less the receiver of compassion, and the less the giver of compassion, the more compassion there is. How odd! |  |
| <span class="blockid">5-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#"If you want to dig a well for water dig one hole and dig it deep\|"If you want to dig a well for water, dig one hole and dig it deep]]<br/><hr class="cell">But these are just suggestions, and take them on if you want to explore. By all means, take them on if they feel useful. Otherwise just let them go. File them for another time, whatever. It's fine. The Buddha has a phrase: "If you're digging for water, if you want to dig a well for water, dig one hole and dig it deep. Don't dig lots of little holes - you're not going to get enough." So the same with all these possibilities. Just take one or two things that seem, "Ah yeah, maybe I can work with that," and dig deep with them. See what happens. Keep the rest for another time. |  |
