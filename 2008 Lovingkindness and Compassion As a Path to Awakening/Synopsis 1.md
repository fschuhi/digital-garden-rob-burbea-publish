| <span class="blockid">1-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#This talk is an orientation for the whole retreat\|This talk is an orientation for the whole retreat]]<br/><hr class="cell">So what I would like to talk about today is _samādhi_. This is a word some of you will be familiar with and some less so. It's a Pali word, _samādhi_. I particularly want to talk about it, in a way, and set up, hopefully, a little bit of an orientation or of an intention for the whole three weeks here, for the whole retreat, a little bit. | <span class="blockid">1-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Metta develops the heart insight and samadhi\|Metta develops the heart, insight and samadhi]]<br/><hr class="cell">So I'd like to talk a bit today about samādhi, which is a word some of you may be familiar with. It's a Pali and a Sanskrit word, samādhi. And go into the meaning of that and the development of that and some different aspects and implications of it. When we were thinking about this retreat, we thought, one of the primary questions was, "Well, is it going to be helpful to people? Is it going to be worthwhile for people?" And I reflected on it a little bit, and I thought, "Well, people will develop mettā, which is a lovely thing. They'll develop that quality of heart. And then, hopefully, there'll be the exposure, the chance to open to the kind of insights that come from mettā practice. And then also there'll be the opportunity to develop samādhi." So three possibilities, any of which, or any amount of which, are all completely worthwhile, would make this time here worthwhile to someone. |
| <span class="blockid">1-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#What is our relationship with samadhi "concentration"\|What is our relationship with samadhi ("concentration")?]]<br/><hr class="cell">So this word _samādhi_ is usually translated as 'concentration,' and that will do as a sort of first translation. It's usually translated as 'concentration.' And it's interesting - as one of the factors of the path that we're interested in developing in, what is our relationship with the development of concentration, of _samādhi_? And often it's an area where we just kind of assume, "Oh, I'm rubbish at that," and we kind of think, "Well, all right, there's other stuff in the path, too, so all right." Or we have a relationship with it where it's a bit fraught, or even a lot fraught; it's an area where we tend to judge ourselves and judge, "Well ..." Or there's a lot of anxiety around whether we're developing it or how well we're developing it. So I want to really explore this whole area, particularly its relevance in terms of this retreat of _mettā_ practice, and as I say, set up an orientation for the whole retreat. |  |
| <span class="blockid">1-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Three major fruits from this retreat\|Three major fruits from this retreat]]<br/><hr class="cell">When a few years ago we were kind of conceiving of this retreat, one of the factors that really convinced me that it was a good idea to do it was that there are basically three major fruits to get out of a retreat like this. **(1)** And the first is **the development of loving-kindness and compassion, developing those qualities in the heart**. And that's a beautiful thing; it's an indispensable and lovely thing for a human being to develop that. **(2)** The second was this piece about **understanding how that leads to awakening, actually using loving-kindness and compassion to move towards awakening**, and understanding emptiness and that kind of liberation of the heart, liberation of the mind. **(3)** And the third one is **the development of _samādhi_**, the development of concentration. And when I was sort of thinking about it, I realized, well, basically, at least some of that is going to happen for everyone, and you can't lose on this retreat. [laughs] It's a win-win-win situation, because all of that's there, and it's available. |  |
| <span class="blockid">1-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#It's good to develop loving-kindness and compassion and that practice leads to concentration\|It's good to develop loving-kindness and compassion, and that practice leads to concentration]]<br/><hr class="cell">Traditionally, in the tradition - actually in the commentaries from the tradition - these practices of loving-kindness and compassion are just regarded as: first of all, it's a good idea to develop loving-kindness and compassion, so something lovely to develop; but secondly, as something that leads to concentration. And this whole factor of awakening was kind of, was reckoned that that wasn't part of what was going on. The thrust of this retreat is actually finding a way back in, of that. |  |
| <span class="blockid">1-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#"Concentration" doesn't give enough breadth to the meaning\|"Concentration" doesn't give enough breadth to the meaning]]<br/><hr class="cell">So _samādhi_, this word - in other traditions it has different meanings, but usually in this tradition it's translated as 'concentration,' as I said. And that's a fine translation. It doesn't give enough of a breadth of what it really means, enough either breadth or depth, this word 'concentration.' When we hear the word 'concentration,' either we tend to think kind of making the mind small and cramming it into a small place and sort of shoving it there and keeping it there, or you tend to think concentrated laundry detergent, so a lot of stuff in a very small space. Or this sense of _keeping_ something _with_ something, so I'm concentrating _on_ the breath, or I'm concentrating on that, just 'keeping it with.' And certainly that 'keeping with' is very much a part of what _samādhi_ means, staying steady with something. But it's not all of it, and in a way, it might be better to keep the word in its original language to get more of a sense of the breadth of what it means, and actually the beauty of what it means. Something very, very beautiful in it. | <span class="blockid">1-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi is often translated as "concentration"\|Samadhi is often translated as "concentration"]]<br/><hr class="cell">So this word samādhi in different traditions actually means different things. I'd just like to use it in quite a particular way. Traditionally - rather, in the Buddhist tradition - not maybe what the Buddha meant, but what has come out of that is actually that mettā practice is something that's pretty much only good for samādhi. I'll explain what that means. Also what's come to us through the tradition is that this word is usually translated as 'concentration,' and with a particular meaning to the word 'concentration,' meaning the way sort of laundry detergent is concentrated. [laughs] You know, it's like a lot of it in a very small space. [laughter] In other words, a very _narrow_ focus of the mind, a kind of microscopic - looking at experience through a microscope. And that has come to be implied in the word samādhi. |
| <span class="blockid">2-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#"Steadiness" "collectedness" "unification" of the body and the mind\|"Steadiness", "collectedness", "unification" of the body and the mind]]<br/><hr class="cell">So we could throw some more words out: certainly 'steadiness' of the mind with something. 'Collectedness' - there's a real collectedness. The mind, the awareness, feels collected, not scattered, collected. 'Unification' is a really good word, so particularly unification of the body and the mind - and in this case, the body, the mind, the heart. There's a real kind of sense of the body and the mind unifying, coming together, being _one_ as the _samādhi_ develops. 'Depth' of meditation is a word one of my teachers used to use a lot, and I actually quite like that. There's a real sense of deepening into something as we develop this. | <span class="blockid">1-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Better "collectedness" even better "unification"\|Better: "collectedness", even better: "unification"]]<br/><hr class="cell">Now, there is some benefit to being able to make the mind small and narrowly focused like that. There's a certain amount of power in it. But if one goes back to the Buddha, and looks through all the volumes of what he said, you can't actually find anything implying anything like that at all. For some reason, that's what's come to us. So rather, I would like to use samādhi in what I feel is more the Buddha's sense of the word, which is more something like 'collectedness': collectedness of mind, collectedness of mind and heart and body. Something maybe even better: 'unification.' Because there's a sense - as John was talking last night - you know, often we're kind of out of contact with the body, a little distant from the body, or the mind and the body feel like two very separate things, disjointed. Or the mind is just scattered here, memory, planning, worry, whatever it is, obsession. And so samādhi is this unification of the mind - unification of the mind, the body, and the heart. |
| <span class="blockid">2-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#The conciousness is becoming more and more refined\|The conciousness is becoming more and more refined]]<br/><hr class="cell">One of the other factors with _samādhi_ is refinement, so the consciousness actually being refined, and this is kind of an interesting one. If we take the other extreme, what's on the other extreme of _samādhi_? Well, something like a tantrum. Put it that way - it's about as far on the other extreme as you could get, a tantrum. It's not a very refined state of consciousness. Things are pretty gross, usually pretty black and white. It's not very refined. Letting go of that, the mind can move into more and more refinement. And one discovers, as one deepens in _samādhi_, more and more refinement to the mind, the consciousness. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#A continuum of deepening unifying refining\|A continuum of deepening, unifying, refining]]<br/><hr class="cell">So we certainly can talk about discrete states of depth of _samādhi_ and this _jhāna_ and that _jhāna_, and I'm actually not going to go into that today. Rather to regard it as a kind of continuum, that the mind can move in this continuum of deepening, of unifying, of refining. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#This is a lifelong exploration\|This is a lifelong exploration]]<br/><hr class="cell">And this is a lifelong exploration. It's something that there is actually no bottom to it, I don't think. We can just keep deepening and refining this. And to me, to be alive on the path and have that aliveness on the path, it's actually lifelong. We keep exploring this. Something very lovely there. Keep exploring the potential depths of consciousness. This is available to us as human beings, as meditators, to just go on this journey into the depths of consciousness. | <span class="blockid">1-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#It's a continuum of depth and a lifelong exploration\|It's a continuum of depth and a lifelong exploration]]<br/><hr class="cell">One of my teachers uses the phrase, uses the translation, 'depth of meditation,' which I like very much. So samādhi is really pointing to a sense of the meditation process, the mind sinking in a very lovely way into its depths, in the way that the sea is calm in its depths. Now, we can talk about a range of states of samādhi, certainly. We can also talk about a continuum, a continuum of depth, a continuum of unification. And this is, _I_ feel very much it's a lifelong exploration. So it's not just something that's a little bit, then we forget about. It's something that all of us as human beings have the potential to grow into and to explore, and usually it's a very gradual, very slow process of exploring. |
| <span class="blockid">2-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi brings an expansion of perception\|Samadhi brings an expansion of perception]]<br/><hr class="cell">_Samādhi_ also brings with it, as it deepens - and I'm talking really about a very big picture now - but it brings an expansion of perception. So the typical, everyday perceptions that we go about our lives governed by - "I'm here, you're there, sitting in a room together, _da-da-da_," - that begins to be expanded. The usual sense of things begins to be expanded. And through that expansion comes a kind of receptivity, very slowly, very gradually - and sometimes suddenly. A receptivity, meaning the beginnings of an opening to another sense of things. Comes a deep sense of rest as the _samādhi_ deepens. The whole being - the body, the mind, the emotions - the whole being finds a really deep rest. We find that as the _samādhi_ develops - over our _life_, really - that we're actually more available to life and to others and to ourselves. There's more capacity in the being to be available. And there's a real freshness of discovery that comes with it, freshness of perception, that we we're able to look at life in very, actually _radically_, different ways, new ways, uncover different Ways of looking. | <span class="blockid">2-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Perceptions expands when the consciousness deepens\|Perceptions expands when the consciousness deepens]]<br/><hr class="cell">So it's an investigation, a lifelong investigation, exploration of the depths of consciousness, of the depths available in consciousness. Also of the kind of expanded perceptions that come about when the consciousness deepens. And all of this, not to grasp too much at these words or the possibilities, but just to know that there are possibilities, and that we can move in a very lovely and gradual way to explore some of this.<br/><hr class="cell"><span style="color:red">also</span> [[Samadhi in Metta Practice#With samadhi we are maximizing the receptivity of the mind\|With samadhi we are maximizing the receptivity of the mind]] |
|  | <span class="blockid">2-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#We need a sense of deep nourishment\|We need a sense of deep nourishment]]<br/><hr class="cell">And why? Well, because it _is_ very lovely. It's really, really very lovely. Of the lovely things that are available to human beings, samādhi is really up there. But more than that - although that's already quite something - we _need_ a sense of nourishment in life. We _need_ a sense of loveliness, a deep loveliness, deep nourishment. A sense of beauty that comes with that, a sense of rest, and very _deep_ rest that comes with that. This is something we really, really need as human beings. We're generally pretty frazzled, pretty scattered, pretty undernourished on a heart, on a being level. And often we don't even realize that. |
|  | <span class="blockid">2-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#With samadhi we are maximizing the receptivity of the mind\|With samadhi we are maximizing the receptivity of the mind]]<br/><hr class="cell">So this rest then allows us to be actually more available to others, which of course is a big part of what mettā is about; more available to others, more available to ourselves, more available to life. And brings a freshness to life. It's almost like the quality of life actually can begin to feel like, or actually it _does_ increase as the mind learns to settle down that way. Freshness to life, fresh discoveries in life come out of this settledness of mind, this unification. Fresh perceptions. And really a sense of receptivity in that, so that our typical way of being in the world, which is, "I'm here, you're there, we're separate, I'm trundling along in my life," all this, this is part of the human condition, that with samādhi we're actually maximizing the receptivity of the mind to other ways of seeing ourselves, seeing others, seeing life. And it's those other ways of seeing that are potentially liberating. So the significance of samādhi is actually huge. It's huge. |
| <span class="blockid">2-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Usually we keep the mind on one object but one could also have a very open kind of vipassa practice\|Usually we keep the mind on one object, but one could also have a very open kind of vipassa practice]]<br/><hr class="cell">Usually with _samādhi_ - and this word 'concentration,' but let's keep it in the Pali or the Sanskrit - usually with _samādhi_, we think in terms of one object, of keeping the mind with one object. So in our case, the _mettā_. Could be compassion, could be one of the other _brahmavihāras_, could be the breath. We tend to think of the _samādhi_ deepening through staying over and over with one object. But actually, _samādhi,_ the word, is even more general, and one could have a very open kind of _vipassanā_ practice, and there's actually still a lot of _samādhi_ there because there's still that collectedness, unification, deepening, etc. | <span class="blockid">2-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi doesn't have to be with just one object\|Samadhi doesn't have to be with just one object]]<br/><hr class="cell">Usually when people talk about samādhi, they're talking about taking one object, like the breath - which we've now put aside, and working with the mettā - or the mettā is one object. So in the instructions here, we're taking one object, which is the mettā, and just the mind staying with that as much as possible. And that's usually what's implied in samādhi, staying with one object. But actually, samādhi in itself, in the broad sense, is something bigger than that, and it can be that we actually have a very _open_ awareness, and not necessarily staying with one object, but there's a sense of this unification happening because of the non-entanglement with things that come up. There's just a free, open, easy, and wise relationship with what's coming up. And that wise relationship brings the unification, brings the depth of mind. It doesn't have to be just with one object. And perhaps as the retreat - in fact, _definitely_ as the retreat goes on, we'll be exploring what that means to open it up too. |
| <span class="blockid">3-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi is state of non-entanglement \|Samadhi is state of non-entanglement.]]<br/><hr class="cell">Usually, our mind moves in relation to objects of experience, experiences that come up, but it moves in ways that are not that helpful. We move, grasping or rejecting or anxious about something or aversive to something. When the mind is in a relationship to experience that, you could say, is open and non-entangled - and whether that's in working with the breath, or doing a _mettā_ practice, or an open _vipassanā_ practice - when that's what's going on, then that's a state of _samādhi_. It's open non-entanglement. | <span class="blockid">2-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#The mind is moving a lot which is not conducive to calm\|The mind is moving a lot, which is not conducive to calm]]<br/><hr class="cell">Usually the mind moves - even if we're practising, you know, insight meditation, the mind is on this, and then it's on that, and then it's on this. So the mind is moving a lot. And oftentimes, even if we think we're being mindful, the relationship with what we're mindful of is actually not all that skilful. There is some degree of pushing away what we don't like, or trying to hang on or something. It's not that skilful, not that conducive to depth of calm. |
|  | <span class="blockid">2-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Metta is the most skilful relationship to have with what's going on\|Metta is the most skilful relationship to have with what's going on]]<br/><hr class="cell">We'll see as the retreat goes on that actually to have a relationship of mettā, of loving-kindness with what comes up, is actually - well, potentially - _the_ most skilful kind of relationship to have with what's going on. And that skilful relationship brings with it this depth, this deepening, I should say. |
| <span class="blockid">3-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#We have limited energy - - which skills are worth developing\|We have limited energy - - which skills are worth developing]]<br/><hr class="cell">When we think about the possible skills that a human being can develop, I mean, human beings are quite amazing, when we reflect on ... There's an almost infinite range of skills that a human being can develop, and some of them are just breathtaking. You know, you think about what it takes to play a piano concerto really well, or to write a piano concerto. Or David Beckham, when he curls the ball like that. [laughter] Amazing! Amazing. And the range is extraordinary. I don't know if you did this when you were a kid - you can pile coins on your elbow. Did you ever do this? And then do _that_. [swiping his arm down] And you catch them - or you hope. You _try_ and catch them. The world record, I think, is like 104 10p pieces. So it's quite amazing. The person probably really put a lot of time and effort developing that skill. [laughter] Amazing! [laughter] Dharmically speaking ... [laughter] Question is, which skills are _worth_ developing? [laughter] What's really _worth_ developing? So I actually very much appreciate David Beckham. [laughter] But really, for ourselves, in our lifetime, we have limited time in this life, limited time. Our time _will_ run out. We have limited energy. What's worth developing as a skill? What's worth developing? | <span class="blockid">3-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi is really worth developing Guinness Book of Records\|Samadhi is really worth developing (Guinness Book of Records)]]<br/><hr class="cell">So of all the things that it's possible for a human being to understand or master or have some skill in - you know, you can think, I don't know if you all know what the _Guinness Book of Records_ is? It's this sort of big book of weird things that people … [laughter] And they get famous because they can do that more or better or faster than anyone else. And so things like, you can stack coins on your elbow and then do _that_ [moves arm] and catch them all in one hand. And some people stack whatever, sixty coins and catch it. And some of it's pretty amazing, you know. [laughter] But if we really think … And actually, some things are very beautiful - the ballet or musical facility, or you see a great football player or basketball player, there's something, I feel, very deeply beautiful in that. But to really ask, actually: in this life, of all the things, the skills, the crafts that we could develop, what's really worth developing? And this samādhi is something that a human being, it's one of their best friends to have some facility in that. |
| <span class="blockid">3-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#The Buddha "Please develop samadhi"\|The Buddha: "Please develop samadhi"]]<br/><hr class="cell">So we often underestimate the power and the importance and the significance of _samādhi_. The Buddha, if you just open some of the texts, over and over and over going on about, "_Please_ develop _samādhi_. Develop _samādhi_. Develop this. You _can_ do it. Develop that skill." | <span class="blockid">3-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Compared to what the Buddha says we might have sidelined samadhi a bit in the West\|Compared to what the Buddha says, we might have sidelined samadhi a bit in the West]]<br/><hr class="cell">And we often underestimate its importance, and its power, and its significance, but if you look at the Buddha's teachings, I mean, it's hard to just turn a few pages without him going on and on, it seems, just constantly repeating himself about the importance of samādhi. I feel that so far in the West - and the Dharma is very young in the West, but - it seems like we've kind of sidelined the importance of samādhi a little bit. So I'm pretty sure that will change just as the Dharma grows up in the West, but so far we've tended to sideline it. |
| <span class="blockid">3-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi brings with it a tremendous of well being\|Samadhi brings with it a tremendous of well being]]<br/><hr class="cell">I don't know if this is fair to say, but in the West so far in the Dharma - the Dharma's very young, and so far kind of haven't really reached into the potential of this side of the practice, of this area of the practice. It tends to get viewed in the way of having a very microscopic concentration on something, so really being able to look at the fine detail. That's not what _samādhi_ means, and the Buddha never meant it that way. So it's more in terms of this unification, this deepening, this coming together, and collecting of the mind. And with that - again, over a lifetime or over a retreat - as this develops, it brings with it a tremendous well-being. Really, the fruits of _samādhi_ are a very deep sense of well-being. Healing - healing to the body, healing to the emotions, healing to the mind. The quality of life as the mind brightens and unifies - quality of life is actually perceptibly improved. |  |
| <span class="blockid">3-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi brings a sense of steadiness into the life\|Samadhi brings a sense of steadiness into the life]]<br/><hr class="cell">Brings a sense of steadiness into the life. And so if one is involved in long-term creative projects - say, writing a piano concerto, whatever it is - it takes actually a lot of steadiness of the mind, a lot of _samādhi_. You need to show up every day and do that and do that and do that. Any kind of creative project, whatever it is, artistic or non-artistic. Or if one's involved in service and the active expression in one's work or volunteering or whatever it is, or just with one's friends and family, the active expression of loving-kindness and compassion needs a kind of steadiness. And it's _samādhi_, in the long run, that gives us that, gives us that kind of long-term steadiness to stay in there, in terms of service and creativity, etc. |  |
| <span class="blockid">4-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi is the best possible soil for insights to take root in\|Samadhi is the best possible soil for insights to take root in]]<br/><hr class="cell">Also in terms of insights, that there's something about _samādhi_ being the best possible soil for insights to take root in. You've all been on retreat before. How many times have we been on retreat and said, "Ah, I _really_ understood that! I really see the impermanence," or "I really get this pattern that I do over and over. I really see it so clearly," and the retreat ends, and a day later, it's just gone? It's just gone. It was just a memory. _Samādhi_ - it's like good soil for a seed. It can take root and actually grow, and the insights become workable, liveable. | <span class="blockid">3-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi is the soil where insights grow\|Samadhi is the soil where insights grow]]<br/><hr class="cell">Samādhi is important, as I said. It brings this well-being, this healing, on a physical level, on an emotional level, on a spiritual level. It also brings insights. Just by itself, it brings insights. And not only that, but it's like the perfect soil for insights to grow in. So when there's samādhi there, it's really the optimum conditions for insights to occur. When the mind is scattered and not unified, we can think we see something: "Ah yes, impermanence. I understand. Fantastic." Or something about the way - our particular patterns of contraction or difficulty, and we see, "Ah yeah, I see it!" If there isn't that samādhi, what tends to happen is we see it very clear, and then five minutes, five weeks, however long later, it doesn't seem to stick. Somehow it doesn't seem to stick. We've had the insight, but it didn't seem to really make a difference to our life. One of the prime reasons for that is there isn't enough samādhi. The soil wasn't quite right; it wasn't quite rich in the nutrients enough, wasn't quite enough moisture in the soil. |
| <span class="blockid">4-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi gets into the being on some very cellular level\|Samadhi gets into the being on some very cellular level]]<br/><hr class="cell">I think it was the first year we ran this retreat, and at a certain point - two-thirds or three-quarters of the way through or something - one of the retreatants said to me, "It's nice _samādhi_ now. You know, I've been here two weeks," or whatever it was, "And some states of nice collectedness, and brightness, and luminosity, and concentration." He said, "But actually, what I think is that I'd be better off not having good concentration because when I leave here, in my life, my mind is scattered, and I'm busy, and I want to learn how to apply the _mettā_ when my mind is how it usually is. And it's a bit unrealistic to sort of just be in these nice states and expect the _mettā_ to apply." And so, actually there was a lot of integrity in what he was saying, but there's something about _samādhi_ that allows things to take root at a cellular level, as the mind collects. So the _mettā_, too, as well as insight, can kind of _take root_ in the being, permeate the cells, become something that's almost second nature in the cells, as the _samādhi_ deepens. So, yes, to learn to apply the _mettā_ and the compassion when the mind is scattered and it's not settled down, and we feel fragmented and not unified. But there's something about spending time with _mettā_ when the mind _does_ feel very unified. It gets into the being [on] some very cellular level. | <span class="blockid">3-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi goes to the cells and bones\|Samadhi goes to the cells and bones]]<br/><hr class="cell">Sometimes we have insights and they're just on the intellectual level: I see it with my mind. But there's something about samādhi, because it involves the whole body, the whole being, actually the insights really go deep, very deep down, and they stick, almost like they're in the cells or in the bones. |
|  | <span class="blockid">3-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#We have lifelong habits of being scattered\|We have lifelong habits of being scattered]]<br/><hr class="cell">How do we develop samādhi? How does it come? We have, as I'm sure you're all aware in just being a day or two on retreat - if you've forgotten, it becomes quite obvious - again, we have lifelong habits, basically, of being scattered, of being entangled in things, of not being collected and calm and unified. And that's really a lifelong habit. And so, first of all, to have some compassion for that. This is - as I said, I think, in the opening talk - it's just part of the human condition. |
| <span class="blockid">4-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#The steadiness of showing up\|The steadiness of showing up]]<br/><hr class="cell">Now, someone pointed out today, we show up on retreat, and (as I said this morning, actually) what we notice is the opposite. We want to focus the mind, and I'm all over the place - the mind's drifting here and there, and I'm off. This is normal. This is very normal. We have a lifetime habit of not paying that much good attention, and that's okay. It's okay. But we can begin to change that and begin to work on it. So just the steadiness of showing up for sitting, for walkings, for sittings, for walking, the steadiness, the continuity of the practice - can you see that that's already the beginning of _samādhi_, that the steadiness itself in the outer form is a kind of _samādhi_? Do you see? It's expressing a steadiness. That steadiness begins to percolate down into the being. And so the mind itself, the heart, the being begins to be more steady. It's the beginnings of _samādhi_. Just show up - _however one feels_. | <span class="blockid">3-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Importance of steadiness\|Importance of steadiness]]<br/><hr class="cell">On the most sort of basic level, though, just the steadiness of practice is really what begins to give life to the samādhi. So that means there's the schedule - just coming to every sitting, just doing every walking. Don't underestimate the power of something that seems so futile, and not to judge too quickly where it is that our mind seems to be. And this transfers, of course, to everyday life, to have an everyday practice that we do everyday. There's something about the steadiness of the form. So whatever I feel like - I feel great; I feel really inspired about meditation; I feel completely disinterested; I feel like crap - doesn't matter. That steadiness, just the _word_ steadiness, the steadiness of the form, it finds its way inside. It finds its way inside, and slowly, slowly becomes a steadiness of mind, a steadiness of the heart. |
| <span class="blockid">4-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#So strength is also an aspect of samadhi\|So strength is also an aspect of samadhi]]<br/><hr class="cell">So this goes for outside practice. You get up one day, and - you know, not on retreat, or here on retreat - and you don't feel so good: "Oh, I'll skip my sitting this morning. I'm a bit tired," or "I'm not feeling well." Understandable. There's something about the steadiness - no matter how one feels - that gives this steadiness, gives a strength as well. So strength is also an aspect of _samādhi_ - strength of mind, a strength that's pliable. I'm not talking about something rigid or brittle, but a deep strength, a soft strength, in a way. And again, that comes into the being, begins to come into the being, just by virtue of showing up, practising, whatever we feel like. And in the practice, sitting or walking, returning: just returning to the phrases, returning to the body, returning to the object over and over and over. Again, it's embodying that steadiness. It's embodying that strength of commitment. That will find its way into the being. And in time, staying more with the phrases, staying more with the object. | <span class="blockid">4-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi has both softness and pliable strength in it\|Samadhi has both softness and pliable strength in it]]<br/><hr class="cell">And in that steadiness is the beginning of strength. And this strength is a factor that we really need in life. Sometimes we're just swamped and bowled over by what's happening. Or something happens, and we realize, "Gosh, I was so in it, and it seemed so huge." Why did it seem so huge, and later it doesn't seem so huge? It's because the strength wasn't there, and we're just swayed. Samādhi has this strength in it, but it's a very pliable strength. It's like there's a softness to samādhi. And these are indispensable factors of mind for the path, and something that we really need, probably more than we realize. |
|  | <span class="blockid">4-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Stay with metta for a while that's how samadhi begins\|Stay with metta for a while, that's how samadhi begins]]<br/><hr class="cell">So the steadiness of form - the steadiness of the form of sitting and walking - and then the steadiness of just doing the practice. So returning, in our case now, to the phrases of mettā when the mind wanders. And then sometimes it feels like I'm really staying with either a feeling of mettā, and can really let the mind stay with that for a while, or staying with the phrases. The mind's quite steady for a few moments, or seconds, or even minutes. And so, just that, the simplicity of that - this is how samādhi begins. Not to underestimate the power of what seems like the most trivial, basic steps. |
| <span class="blockid">5-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#One of the fruits of samadhi is steadiness study results\|One of the fruits of samadhi is steadiness (study results)]]<br/><hr class="cell">So one of the fruits of _samādhi_ - and I'm talking about long-term and in a lifetime. You will probably notice on this retreat, definitely. Again, please remember, what I'm talking about today might feel like, "Well, I'm nowhere near that." It's the beginning of the retreat. I'm talking hopefully something you can keep in the back of your mind, at least in the back, for the whole retreat. One of the fruits of _samādhi_ is happiness - happiness, joy. And the Buddha talked over and over about this and the importance of it. Recently, in the last couple of years, there was a study done of meditators and found that meditators were actually happier than non-meditators. And there was something - if I get this right - the right prefrontal cortex was more active, which is your positive emotions. And the left was less active, which is your negative. I'm not sure if that's the right way round, but something like that. And interestingly, what they found was, generally, meditators were happier. But meditators who'd done at least 10,000 hours ... [laughs] There's some kind of significant _jump_ in the graph there. [laughter] 10,000 hours and the whole thing leaps. So I don't know how quick you are at arithmetic, but 10,000 hours is quite a lot! [laughs] It's a lot more than you even do on this retreat. But just to say, hang in there! [laughs] But definitely, definitely, and the Buddha, you know, millennia ago, was very clear: _samādhi_ in the long term leads to happiness, no question about it. | <span class="blockid">4-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Happiness is the most significant cause of samadhi\|Happiness is the most significant cause of samadhi]]<br/><hr class="cell">When the Buddha was asked what the most significant cause for samādhi was, he said something that might at first sound a bit surprising. He said, "Happiness." It's the thing that most leads to samādhi. A happy mind can settle itself, can become unified, can sink into the beautiful depths. |
| <span class="blockid">5-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#It works also in the reverse the most important contributor to samadhi is happiness\|It works also in the reverse: the most important contributor to samadhi is happiness]]<br/><hr class="cell">But he said something very interesting as well, and it's kind of the reverse. And someone asked him, "Okay, so _samādhi_ is a good idea. What's the thing that most feeds _samādhi_, that's the most important contributor to _samādhi_?" Without blinking, he said, "Happiness."^[SN 12:23] So that's interesting - happiness _comes_ from _samādhi_, but happiness _feeds_ _samādhi_. And this is very, very significant for us as meditators. We need, and particularly on a retreat like this, we need to take care, as much as possible, of a kind of baseline foundation of our sense of well-being, nourish our sense of happiness. So I'm not talking about any fireworks. I'm just talking about inclining the mind to a sense of well-being, of nourishment. | <span class="blockid">4-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Happiness is both fruit and cause of samadhi\|Happiness is both fruit and cause of samadhi]]<br/><hr class="cell">So happiness is actually a fruit of samādhi: when there's samādhi, the happiness comes in a very natural way, a very organic way, from that collectedness, from that unification. But the Buddha's saying it's also something that is a _cause_ for samādhi. This is quite interesting. And in my experience, it's absolutely, definitely true. So that when people come on retreat, especially if it's for an extended period of time, just to make sure - you know, we usually make sure with them: "Is everything sorted out in your life, as much as possible? Just have you tied up any loose ends and all that?" So this kind of simplicity of being actually lends itself to happiness. |
| <span class="blockid">5-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#There are many things to appreciate\|There are many things to appreciate]]<br/><hr class="cell">So how do we go about that? Can we be on the retreat in a way that's open? Sometimes, very understandably, we come on retreat, and because of what we've heard or seen or just get into a groove, we do _this_, and we kind of shrink down the awareness. And we say, "Right, I'm really going to apply myself," and it shrinks down. Can there be - and please experiment with this - a kind of opening, receptivity, and an inclining the mind towards appreciation? So there are all kinds of things right here, right now, today, in this retreat, to appreciate. Many, many things - we have eight wonderful managers looking after us, cooking for us, taking care of us; we have the beauty of the grounds, the building, the nature; we have the teachings; we have each other. And again, I think Catherine said on the opening talk, you know, we can get very much into this 'eyes down' kind of thing. What would it be - please experiment - to look around? "Who's here? Who am I practising with? Who are these lovely people dedicating themselves, supporting me in my practice? How wonderful!" Because how much more difficult it would be if we were here alone, one was here alone. Have a look around at lunchtime. You know, sometimes you want to be a bit more inner, and it's appropriate to be with one's own experience. But other times, open up. Can there be an appreciation of the beauty of what's going on here and the loveliness of everyone practising together, trying together, supporting each other, in the silence, in the schedule, and all that? | <br/><hr class="cell"><span style="color:red">also</span> [[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Appreciation\|Appreciation]] |
| <span class="blockid">5-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Gratitude loving the Dharma nature\|Gratitude, loving the Dharma, nature]]<br/><hr class="cell">Gratitude - so feeding gratitude, taking a little time in the day to incline the mind this way, to think everything that's helped for you to even be here. Three weeks out of your life to be here - gratitude for that. What else feeds this, kind of nurtures this base level of happiness? Maybe simplicity, and sort of letting go into the simplicity of being here. Love of the Dharma - you know, for some people, this is really strong, just loving to be able to practise, to have this time to practise, to be able to hear the teachings, to be able to be in an environment - brings joy. Nature - I mentioned this this morning. So please do take some time to open to nature. Go out. Take it in. Be nourished by it. | <span class="blockid">4-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Gratitude\|Gratitude]]<br/><hr class="cell">Gratitude - these are the kind of qualities. We have to think about, "How can I feed happiness? What can I reflect on in a way that brings a sense of gratitude? How can I nourish that sense of gratitude so that a sense of happiness can flow out of it?"<br/><hr class="cell"><span style="color:red">also</span> [[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Love of the Dharma\|Love of the Dharma]] |
|  | <span class="blockid">4-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Freedom from remorse\|Freedom from remorse]]<br/><hr class="cell">Freedom from remorse. So that means taking care of our ethical behaviour, that we can feel actually happy and proud about how we are acting with each other. That's really, really important as a basis for practice. |
|  | <span class="blockid">4-7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Appreciation\|Appreciation]]<br/><hr class="cell">Appreciation. Again, this is linked to gratitude, but maybe being at Gaia House, maybe being with a group of people so committed to the Dharma, so committed to loving-kindness, so committed to practice. Appreciation for the people here, the managers who are taking care of us. All this. How can we open the heart in a way that nourishes the happiness? This is something to actually reflect on and take steps towards. Really important as a foundation for samādhi. |
|  | <span class="blockid">4-8</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Love of the Dharma\|Love of the Dharma]]<br/><hr class="cell">Just one's own love of the Dharma. One's own love of practice, one's own love of exploration, one's own love of stillness, of quietness. To allow that in. |
|  | <span class="blockid">5-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Nature\|Nature]]<br/><hr class="cell">Nature. For myself, that's a huge part of - just the connection with nature. And we're in a very beautiful part of the country. Is that something that we're allowing in, to feed the practice, to feed a sense of happiness? So as I said, samādhi is not this sort of, "Okay I'm going to put blinkers on and do this microscope thing." It actually has a beauty, even in the beginnings of it. There's an openness to beauty. There's a width, a breadth to it. |
| <span class="blockid">6-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#It's going to happen in a very non-linear way\|It's going to happen in a very non-linear way]]<br/><hr class="cell">So over time, gradually, the _samādhi_, the collectedness, the unification, the concentration begins to deepen, begins to deepen. This does not happen - ever - in a linear way. In other words, if someone comes into an interview and they just report this steady, smooth assent into the ethereal realms of bliss, without any ups and downs, it's not realistic. It doesn't happen. It's going to happen in a very non-linear way, very up and down, and that's just how human consciousness works. | <span class="blockid">5-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#It's never a linear process\|It's never a linear process]]<br/><hr class="cell">As the mind begins to settle through taking care in the basic ways that I've said so far, what we begin to see is that it's a completely non-linear process. It's completely non-linear. And I've talked to monks who've spent decades living in caves and forests - basically decades of their life, devoted to this exploration of the depth of consciousness, of samādhi. And they say, "Yeah, you know, sometimes it's just really hard. The mind just doesn't settle down." It's always going to be like that, always. And not to expect it to be different. It's never a linear process. It's always got to have these waves to it. |
| <span class="blockid">6-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Learn to expect and accept the hindrances and learn to work with them\|Learn to expect and accept the hindrances, and learn to work with them]]<br/><hr class="cell">So I was talking this morning about the hindrances and the sort of very typical challenges we face. Learn to expect the waves, okay? Just, they're a given. Learn to expect them. Learn to accept them, meaning accept that they're there. To accept them doesn't mean to kind of lie down and let them steamroll over you and dictate the whole course of your consciousness for two or three days. But to accept that they're there. They're a feature of consciousness. Sometimes it's a matter of just seeing them out - just be patient, just keep plugging away, and one sees them out. Other times, we gave a lot of possibilities this morning of ways of working with them, and really being quite active. So sometimes it's just seeing them out, and sometimes really working quite actively - very important though - in the context of accepting them. So learning to work with. | <span class="blockid">5-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Learn to expect and accept hindrances\|Learn to expect and accept hindrances]]<br/><hr class="cell">One of the signs of maturing in practice is actually we've learnt, we're learning, to expect these waves. So the 'hindrances' - some of you are familiar with this word - the hindrances to meditation. To really expect them and accept them. We can learn to see them out, okay? We can also learn to work with them, and this is really important, because it's not going to be this lovely, smooth ascent into the heavens of bliss. It's going to be pretty much a rough ride. [laughter] And pretty much you can expect every time there's a deepening, somehow, for some reason that I don't think anyone's really figured out yet, there tends to be a backlash. So you feel like, "Wow, that's opened to a new level!", and then all hell breaks loose. Don't know why, but that's just the way the human mind unfolds into depth, for some reason. |
|  | <span class="blockid">5-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Aversion\|Aversion]]<br/><hr class="cell">When it's rough, what we can begin to realize is this is just the mind doing the mind's patterns. It's just the human mind doing the human mind's patterns. We don't have to be taken for a ride with it, by it. So for example, I think Catherine's going to talk about aversion tomorrow night. Aversion is one of the hindrances. When I sat down first to do mettā, my very first experience of mettā twenty years ago, "Great! Sounds like a great idea." Sat down, listened to the instructions, tried it. _Fuming_ with rage! [laughter] Coming out of my ears, it was! What's going on? Aversion is what's going on, anger. |

Now, sometimes they're very subtle, and sometimes they're quite strong. The difference, the important thing is, as we get maturity in the practice, we actually realize, "Oh, it's just aversion. It's not _actually_ that the person sitting next to me deserves to be kicked out of retreat or die or something." We tend to think that it's the situation that's a problem. And the maturity is, "Oh, it's just the human mind with the seed of aversion," and that seed of aversion has come and made a little, usually ugly, plant of aversion. And that's just what it is. And to recognize it for what it is. We don't have to get so caught up in the content of what the aversion is saying, or what the greed is saying, or what the restlessness is saying, or whatever it is, or the doubt. |
| <span class="blockid">6-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#No being taken for a ride not taking them personally\|No being taken for a ride, not taking them personally]]<br/><hr class="cell">And the two things, the two general points that I mentioned this morning: **(1)** if possible, **not being taken for a ride, recognizing, "This is what's going on. Ah, it's such-and-such a hindrance. Aha! Okay," and not getting so, in a way, seduced or infatuated by the story** and the content of what it seems that's going on - this craving or aversion or whatever it is, or the doubt. Seeing it for what it is, recognizing it - huge. Half the battle is right there. **(2)** And **not taking them personally**, so not judging oneself because of the presence of a hindrance. This is huge. Once we judge ourselves because a hindrance is there, we're adding fuel to the fire with the hindrance. Not to take them personally. Can we have an attitude of kindness, so that this whole retreat is kind of imbued as much as possible with an attitude of kindness? You know, the hindrances come up, it's difficult, you're in a difficult stretch, a couple of hours that are difficult, half a day that's difficult - how much kindness can we meet that with? Not reactivity, but kindness. | <span class="blockid">5-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Maturity comes from not taking things so personal\|Maturity comes from not taking things so personal]]<br/><hr class="cell">This is a real sign of maturity: "Oh, it's just that. I don't have to be pulled into the story of it." This comes with practice. It comes with a maturity, and it's just, "Oh, okay, just the hindrance. Strap in!", you know. It's okay. It's really okay. Don't have to be sucked into the story. Also with maturity, we don't have to take it so personally: "Oh, doubt again. Oh, sleepiness again. Oh, greed again. I'm such a lousy meditator. I'm such a greedy person, such an angry person. If I were _da-da-da-da,_ then this wouldn't happen." It's the human mind. In the Buddha's words, it's anattā. It's not me, not mine, it's not-self. It's not who I am. It's just the mind has these seeds. Human minds have these seeds, from the day you're born till the day you die, unless you're completely and utterly enlightened. It has these seeds, and they're not-self; it doesn't imply anything about ourselves. |
| <span class="blockid">6-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Objections towards samadhi practice\|Objections towards samadhi practice]]<br/><hr class="cell">Anyone who's doing a practice like this, like a _mettā_ practice, or working with the breath, or compassion, or some kind of cultivation practice, or anyone who _hears_ about a practice like this - maybe not anyone, but 99 per cent of people - will often have at least one of four objections, if not all four. And it can seem like one begins to do a practice like this, and the whole idea of staying with something, and the whole idea of _samādhi_, seems like, "Hmm, maybe it's not such a good idea after all." And it can feel very difficult. So I want to go into this and explore it, and hopefully just look at these with a bit of intelligence and reconsider them. |  |
| <span class="blockid">6-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#1 Tightness\|1. Tightness]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(1)** When we give ourselves to cultivating _samādhi_, oftentimes what comes up is a sense of **tightness**. In the process, we actually feel quite tight - and you may have, probably, discovered that already. Trying to stay with something, you're trying, and it can feel really tight. The very effort to stay with something can feel tight. Tightening. |  |
| <span class="blockid">7-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#2 Working towards a goal\|2. Working towards a goal]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(2)** The whole notion of **working towards a goal**, a goal of deepening my concentration or developing _samādhi_ or developing _mettā_, and "Won't I get into some striving around that?" So these are very legitimate concerns, and I just want to explore them a little bit: tightness, relationship with goals and striving for goals. |  |
| <span class="blockid">7-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#3 Attachment\|3. Attachment]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(3) Attachment** - if this leads to happiness or if _samādhi_ feels good, won't I maybe get attached there, and get stuck there? |  |
| <span class="blockid">7-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#4 Suppression\|4. Suppression]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(4)** And the last one, **suppression**. Is it possible that through this just, you know, repeating phrases to myself, or just staying with one thing and maybe even feeling good in doing that, that I'm actually suppressing some emotion or some issue in the being, in the psyche, that needs to come up? Someone brought that up this morning. |  |
| <span class="blockid">7-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Those doubts wil come up\|Those doubts wil come up]]<br/><hr class="cell">These four: **(1) tightness**, **(2) relationship to goals and striving**, **(3) attachment, the possibility of attachment**, and **(4) the question of suppression - are we suppressing?** So I want to go into this a little bit. These come up. They _will_ come up. They're going to come up, these questions and these doubts. And a lot of people are going to feel put off as that comes up. So we're practising _samādhi_, and something comes up like this, and we think, "Oh I should leave all that. I should leave this _mettā._ I should leave the _samādhi_. And I'll just go to an open practice of 'being with what is' - not trying to do anything, just 'being with what is' or 'just being' or whatever." And this is unbelievably common. I mean, almost everyone who goes about doing a practice like this will have that quite strong inclination at one point: "Too much work," or "I don't really think this is right, let me just - ahh! - just _be_; go to an open _vipassanā_ practice." So I want to go into this. | <span class="blockid">6-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#It's just human stuff have some kindness towards it in meditation\|It's just human stuff, have some kindness towards it in meditation]]<br/><hr class="cell">So can we actually begin to see (and this is part of maturing in samādhi; this is part of the insight of samādhi), can we see it's just stuff? It's just human stuff. It doesn't say anything about me. I am a human. I have a mind. This is what it's going to do. And can we actually begin to look at it that way? It's not me, it's not mine. Don't have to take it personally. Can we have some kindness towards what's difficult in meditation? We'll be talking much more about this as the retreat goes on. Not getting so much into reaction because a certain difficulty is around. |
| <span class="blockid">7-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#ad 2 tightness\|ad 2. tightness]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(1)** First one: **tightness**. How can we do this practice and not get so tight? So softness - in a way the opposite of tightness - softness is actually a factor of _samādhi_. So when we talk about what does _samādhi_ mean, it actually has softness in it; it has a kind of non-rigidity, non-tightness in it; it's part of the quality of _samādhi_. One of the ways that's very important to prevent tightness taking too much hold - and it _will_ come up. You _will_ be dealing at times with tightness. There's no question about it, as you try this practice, no question. One of them is to make the mindfulness a bit bigger, meaning make the range of the awareness a bit bigger. As I said at least once in the instructions, the Buddha says "sensitive to the whole body."^[DN 22, MN 110] Can we have, as very much a part of our practice, an awareness that includes the whole body? And kind of to be anchored in that. And as well, in this breadth of mindfulness, an awareness of, "How am I feeling about the practice right now? What's my emotional relationship with the practice right now? Am I bored? Am I trying too hard? Am I disinterested? Am I striving?" The body sense can reflect this relationship that we have with the practice in the moment. When we get too tight, what happens? We actually feel it in the body. So part of the art of meditation, part of the art of deepening _samādhi_, is to have this kind of background awareness of breadth of the body awareness, and be sensitive to it. It will reflect what's going on in terms of the relationship. | <span class="blockid">6-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Tightness can come from focus but relaxing the latter is only one way to deal with tightness\|Tightness can come from focus, but relaxing the latter is only one way to deal with tightness]]<br/><hr class="cell">In the instructions, we're taking one object, which is mettā, and we're returning to that. So samādhi in that sense, so far. In my experience, both for myself and teaching, it's very common for - quite soon, often - when people take an object, whether it's the breath or mettā, for a sense of tightness to come in. And then, usually, if you're sitting an Insight Meditation retreat, what happens is the instructions move quite quickly to opening out. And then there's a sense of, "Ahh," just being with everything, and not staying with an object like the breath. What happens for most people is that when they open out, the tightness that they felt in trying to stay with one object goes away. And it's like, "Ahh! Lovely!" So the answer is, ditch the trying to meditate on one object, and just kind of relax and open out. And that has a certain benefit to it. But is it possible, actually, that we can find a way of working that doesn't feel tight, or doesn't feel uncomfortable, limited that way? |
|  | <span class="blockid">6-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Doing samadhi am I suppressing some emotions\|Doing samadhi, am I suppressing some emotions?]]<br/><hr class="cell">Usually, it's my experience that people shy away from samādhi for a number of reasons. One is this tightness that comes in, very normal. One is the whole notion of seeming to be striving or orienting towards a goal. Very understandable, and I'll go into these in more detail. And one is a question of, "If I'm staying with one thing and getting nice and calm, am I suppressing something else that needs to come up? Am I suppressing some emotions that need to come up? Am I suppressing some part of my being that needs to come up?" That's a very intelligent and important question to ask, and it reflects a kind of integrity and honesty when people ask that question, that they really, you know, "Let's look at what's going on here. Am I hiding from something?" |

It's very important. The body sense is actually crucial, and that's why I keep saying the "sensitive to the whole body." The body is really at the anchor of what we're doing. And as the _samādhi_ deepens, the body sense actually changes. So it gets a little bit more spacious or more refined or more open or less defined. And that's all part of - over time, over time - of the _samādhi_ deepening. But we can work with this tightness, and in the sensitivity to the body, be aware of when it's there, and then just relax the body. Just relax the body. It's part of the big picture, the art of the _samādhi_, of the meditation. So sensitive to the whole body. |  |

I. Be. At. Ease._" [laughter] It's not going to happen that way. It's not going to happen. Best intentions may be there, you know, but there needs to be a real gentleness and relaxation in the approach. Gritting the teeth, you know, _sometimes_ it's appropriate, but more often - it's a real art. All this stuff is a real art. It's very delicate. It's a very delicate art, a very subtle art. | <span class="blockid">6-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Move towards softening the sense of the body\|Move towards softening the sense of the body]]<br/><hr class="cell">So, to unpack these a little bit. How can we practise without this sense of tightness or work with this sense of tightness? Samādhi actually has a kind of softness to it. It's one of the characteristics, one of the qualities of this unification of mind, is actually there's a softening, a softening of the being, softening of the heart, softening of the sense of the body. How to move towards _that_, and not so much of this tightness? |
| <span class="blockid">8-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Can there be kindness inbuing the whole thing\|Can there be kindness inbuing the whole thing?]]<br/><hr class="cell">So again, can there be kindness to oneself in this? We drift off - okay, watch that point. Am I judging that? Am I getting too tight in response to the fact that I drifted off? Can there be kindness imbuing the _whole_ thing, gentleness imbuing the whole thing? And sometimes there's just going to be tightness. There's just going to be tightness, and you _will_ feel, "Ah, I should go to _vipassanā_ practice. Just be open." Sometimes you just have to - you try to relax it, you're being as gentle as you can. It's just, "Okay, just accept the tightness." And just to have that sense of kindness around it and accepting of it, and it will change. | <span class="blockid">6-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Emotion is reflected as a contraction in the body\|Emotion is reflected as a contraction in the body]]<br/><hr class="cell">One way, or one important factor, is actually that - well, we might say the mindfulness, the awareness, has a bit more breadth to it. So as I say, it's not this totally microscopic thing. A bit more breadth to the mindfulness, and an awareness of the body as a whole: how the body is feeling, the sense of the body at any time. And the sense of the emotions at any time. In other words, what's my emotional relationship with the practice right now? Is it tight? Is it disinterested? Is it grasping? Is it striving? And we can actually feel that emotion, and feel it in the body, because that will be reflected as a kind of contraction in the body if the mindfulness has a certain breadth to it and is aware of the body. This breadth is actually a very important factor. When we feel that tightness, can we actually just begin to relax it? So, awareness of the body, the whole body, just seeing if that tightness can be relaxed in the body. And sometimes it _can_, just by becoming aware of it.<br/><hr class="cell"><span style="color:red">also</span> [[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Can we be okay with a sense of tightness\|Can we be okay with a sense of tightness?]] |
| <span class="blockid">8-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#The body reflects if there is too much effort\|The body reflects if there is too much effort]]<br/><hr class="cell">But we can be sensitive to the effort that we put in. In this body sensitivity, you can feel when there's too much effort because the body reflects it - tightness in the shoulders, or the belly gets tight, or something just cramps up a little bit. And be sensitive to that, as part of the practice, and relax it. So part of the developing the art is deepening this sensitivity and subtlety of attention to effort levels. And we learn: "Oh, a bit more, you know, a bit more foot on the gas; a bit off, a bit more off." Part of the art - play with it. Experiment. Bring it in rather than leaving it out. | <span class="blockid">7-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Less effort more subtlety\|Less effort, more subtlety]]<br/><hr class="cell">Samādhi, or moving towards this unification, this deepening, it's not the case that you roll up your sleeves, and you clench your jaw, and you grit your teeth, and "Right, I'm going to go for it!" The whole question of effort is really, really crucial, actually. And it turns out that it's very subtle. It has a lot of subtlety, this question of effort. You can't be too clenched, and you can't just throw the whole baby out with the bathwater, as the phrase goes. |
|  | <span class="blockid">7-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Can we be okay with a sense of tightness\|Can we be okay with a sense of tightness?]]<br/><hr class="cell">First thing: are we coming from a place of kindness to ourself? So we are aspiring to transformation; we are aspiring to opening. Can we just take care of where we're coming from, as much as possible? Coming from a place of kindness. And maybe periodically to check in with where we're coming from, as I said. If there _is_ tightness, sometimes it can be relaxed. Sometimes we may just have to actually accept that that's what's there. Can we be okay with a sense of tightness? Can that sense of tightness be accommodated in a larger awareness? It's really okay. Sometimes it has to go through a sense of tightness. |
|  | <span class="blockid">7-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Accepting that the tightness is there\|Accepting that the tightness is there]]<br/><hr class="cell">I was speaking with someone about their meditation practice a little while ago, and they were struggling with this for a while. We had a conversation, and they went away. And they actually came back and figured out for themselves - I can't remember what _I_ said, but it obviously wasn't very helpful! [laughter] - they came back and said it was just a matter of actually accepting that the tightness was there. And once they had just accepted that, that that's what the quality of the awareness was, there was just some tightness, it actually made a big difference. |
|  | <span class="blockid">7-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Can there be a kindness to the sense of tightness\|Can there be a kindness to the sense of tightness?]]<br/><hr class="cell">As the retreat goes on, we'll be talking about even perhaps going a step further, and beginning to turn the mettā itself _on_ the emotions, on, for instance, a sense of tightness. So we'll really go into that in more detail. But can there be kindness, even, to the sense of tightness? |
| <span class="blockid">8-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Find a balance between too much effort and being too loose\|Find a balance between too much effort and being too loose]]<br/><hr class="cell">So in a way, and particularly in the context of _mettā_ practice, Catherine - I spoke to Catherine last night a couple of times. And she told me she spoke a bit about - to oneself, the _mettā_ to oneself - giving and receiving love. So this is also connected with the effort. Sometimes we might need to move more into a receptive mode, receiving. And that can very much help with the tightness as well, and generally with the _mettā_. If we're too tight, too tight with the effort, too efforting, it can have the opposite effect of what we intend. And the mind is actually squeezed, and - not a particularly great image, but it's a bit like a half-peeled banana, and you're squeezing the bottom end, and the banana ... Well, either it crushes it ... [laughs] Or it flies off. With the best intentions, you're trying to be too tight. You're actually ending up being too tight with the mind, and it has the opposite effect: the mind drifts off more. More thoughts and more following thoughts. Or sometimes we're too loose, and there's just a dullness that comes in, a kind of sinking of the consciousness that comes in. To be aware of this: it's all part of the subtlety, and you can be aware of it, and you can play with it. It's a very delicate process. Okay, so that first objection, tightness. | <span class="blockid">7-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Play with the balance of receiving and probing\|Play with the balance of receiving and probing]]<br/><hr class="cell">There needs to be a growing, deepening sensitivity to the whole question of effort. It's really important for samādhi. It's also very important for insight. It's very important for love too. Sometimes there's more of a relaxed sense, more of a just - let me put it another way: that the awareness might be _receiving_ the phrases, or _receiving_ the breath, if we're working with the breath. And sometimes more of a _probing_ sense. And this balance, it's very connected with effort. When it's more relaxed, there's a less efforted space. Very important to play - important word: play - with this balance. This is something we need to explore for ourselves, and make it very personal, very alive, very meaningful for ourselves. We can actually do _this_ and do _this_, and see, "Ah, what's needed now? How does it feel? What are the effects?" |
|  | <span class="blockid">7-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#We are giving metta to ourselves but we are also receiving metta\|We are giving metta to ourselves, but we are also receiving metta]]<br/><hr class="cell">In mettā practice, this actually has other implications. Already now, we're giving the mettā to ourselves. We're _giving_ the mettā to ourselves, so we're giving, but we're also _receiving_ mettā. So sometimes in doing the practice, you can tune into the sense of what it is to feel that flow of giving, and sometimes tune into the flow, "I'm _receiving_ mettā. I'm _receiving_ that goodwill." And what does it feel like to be in the receiving of it? Both are important. Some of us need practice, actually, at receiving love, not only giving it. Sometimes we, for all different kinds of reasons, we put up barriers and defences to actually receiving love. So sometimes it's good in the practice to really tune into that quality, and feel oneself receiving. |
|  | <span class="blockid">7-7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#The question of effort is connected with a sense of duality which is connected with a sense of love\|The question of effort is connected with a sense of duality, which is connected with a sense of love]]<br/><hr class="cell">If there's too much tightness, it can actually cause the mind to spin off in thinking. It's like a banana that's peeled, and you're squeezing it, and it's like, it might shoot off out the end. Somehow, too much tightness in practice actually causes more thought - _can_ do. Sometimes too much relaxation actually causes kind of sinking, which then just spins off into tiredness. So this is something that's very delicate; this whole question of effort is very delicate. And it's very connected with love at a very deep level, actually. When there's effort, there's a sense of "me being somewhere and trying to get somewhere else." Now, there may be some acceptance in that, but if we talk about a really boundless love, a boundless acceptance, there's a duality there: this and that. I am here, and I want to be there. That duality, that separation, at a very deep level, a very deep level of love, that's exactly what gets ended, that duality - in _all_ things; not just between self and other, but between _things_. So this question of effort is connected, at a very deep level, with a sense of duality, and a sense of duality is very much connected with a sense of love. |

And we could really, gosh, talk all day about this. But sometimes, or quite often, there's the temptation to think, "Goals are not spiritual. There's nowhere to get." And we may have heard that, and it might really resonate with us: "There's nothing to do and nothing to get, nowhere and no one to be, nothing to become," etc. It can be very powerful. And yes, there's definitely something to that, there's definitely a depth that needs to be explored there. But don't be too quick with it. Don't be too quick. And to bring one's whole integrity and intelligence to this question, and honesty. Our life is _full_ of goals. _Full_ of goals our life is! So at 5:30 it will be teatime, and the bell will go, and then my goal is going to be, and probably most of you, is going to be to get to the tea and get some soup down the throat. That's my goal. It's not a big deal! [laughter] Our life is _full_ of goals. Right now my goal is to communicate something about this piece in a way that's as helpful and clear as possible.

There's a lot to learn from playing with effort and really understanding it for oneself in a practical way. People also shy away from the development of samādhi because, as I said, because it seems like a goal-oriented practice. But we have all kinds of goals in life, and maybe we actually _need_ goals in life. Some are very simple. You know, at 5:30 when the bell goes for tea, probably most of us, it will be our goal to go and have a drink and eat tea. Where's …? There's no problem in that. It's very simple. Goals don't have to be a problem. |

In fact, samādhi doesn't really lead to a sense of attachment, contrary to what we might hear. This is something that we can really enjoy. When there's the mind calming down that way, we can really begin to tune into that sense of enjoyment. And that enjoyment, even if it's very quiet, just nothing to really write home about at this point, that is very beneficial and very much what helps the samādhi deepen. So when there is a sense of enjoyment, just letting the being open to that, letting the being be touched by that. |

Be very careful with this area. _Yes_, non-duality - and as the retreat goes on, we'll be talking a lot about this area of non-duality and emptiness and stuff. But to really understand it, to really understand what it means, non-duality - it's hard to really understand at any depth without a depth of _samādhi_, funnily enough. It's actually going through all this, and this efforting, and even a notion of goals with the _samādhi_, that actually brings a whole reorientation in terms of dualities and goals - because usually, people are too quick with saying, "Oh it's all non-dual. There's nothing to get." But they fall back on a default perception, a default understanding of the way things are, and it's still, "I'm here, and this is what's going on for me: the mind is cloudy, or the mind is like this, or whatever. And that's okay, and that's where the non-duality comes." A deeper understanding of non-duality - which can come out of _samādhi_ practice and _mettā_ practice - is that actually, there's no 'way things are.' The mind is _not_ like it appears to be right now, it's _not_ clouded, it's _not_ clear, it's _not_ deep, it's _not_ shallow, I'm _not_ sitting here, you're _not_ sitting there, this is _not_ Gaia House, this is _not_ a meditation retreat. It can be hard to understand that without having gone through the depth of _samādhi_. So there's a depth of understanding non-duality, and I think it's important to uncover that, not to settle for something that's - well, in a way, cheaper. |  |
| <span class="blockid">9-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Our mind is often dwelling in unhelpful places\|Our mind is often dwelling in unhelpful places]]<br/><hr class="cell">I think in the opening talk John mentioned this word _brahmavihāra_. So _brahma_ means 'divine' or 'sublime,' and _vihāra_ means 'dwelling.' So these practices, loving-kindness and compassion, are really dwellings for the heart: the heart, the being, the consciousness dwells in a space, in an inner space, of beauty, of sublimity, of something that feels divine. And more and more, as the retreat goes by, you will get a sense of that, of a real dwelling place for the consciousness, for the mind, for the heart. So _brahmavihāras_ - _mettā_, compassion, joy, and equanimity - they are divine abidings, divine dwellings, _brahmavihāras_. _Samādhi_, too - as the _samādhi_ deepens, it becomes a dwelling for the consciousness. When we think about "Where does my consciousness, my mind, usually dwell?", and we actually look at that, it's often not in the greatest of places. [laughter] Oftentimes it's not really actually dwelling anywhere at all. It's all over the place. It's not dwelling. It's not abiding anywhere. It's literally just pulled here and then pulled there, and whatever it is that's sort of making the biggest impression is where it's 'dwelling.' Very _un_settled, _not_ dwelling. Or, and maybe even worse, is we're actually dwelling in something that's really not very helpful for us - self-criticism, self-judgment, irritability at others, a whole range of difficult states that sadly, but realistically, human beings can kind of make a home out of. We can get so used to this over our life and over the decades, so used to, as I was saying this morning, the groove kind of being one of unhelpfulness and unhappiness. Something not so helpful becomes our dwelling, and it's almost second nature to us. | <span class="blockid">8-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Dwelling in a lovely space\|Dwelling in a lovely space]]<br/><hr class="cell">When the Buddha talked about love and compassion, loving-kindness and compassion, he called them brahmavihāras, which translates as 'divine abiding' or 'divine dwelling.' So this is actually something - to live in love is to live, is to dwell, in what is divine for a human being. Samādhi is also a kind of dwelling. Where is the mind dwelling? Is it dwelling in that depth, in that stillness, in that calmness? In the enjoyment of that? Or oftentimes, you know, as humans, it's not; it's dwelling in what's really difficult. Actually, obsessing is a kind of dwelling. So some problem, some issue, something about ourselves that we don't like or are having trouble with, or in relationship, and the mind just goes round and round and round and round, and just sticks to that, and can't seem to disengage the mind from it. So we're exhausted by the end of the day, and you flop into bed, and you get what's called 'poor man's samādhi'! You spend the night, and hopefully some relief, and then you wake up, and it just starts all over again. [laughter] But this is where we dwell a lot of the time. And so to deepen in samādhi is to actually learn - the mind learns to find a home, the heart learns to find a home, a dwelling, in a more lovely space. Really, really crucial. |

Oftentimes we find ourselves with a lot of thought, and it's oftentimes a lot of self-critical thought, self-judgmental thought, or judging others, or a situation. What if we use that energy of thought (which is already zipping around), and we use the _mettā_ (which is thought; it's thought-energy)? And we're just redirecting the thought-energy, replacing the unskilful thought with skilful thought. |  |
| <span class="blockid">10-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Story metta all the day\|Story: metta all the day]]<br/><hr class="cell">I remember a period - I can't remember how long it was, maybe a year, or two years or something - when I just gave myself just to _mettā_ practice for that time. So all my formal practice, and as much as possible throughout the day - you know, in the shower, walking down the street, whatever it was, just _mettā_, _mettā_, _mettā_. An absolutely wonderful thing to do. At the beginning of that period, what was quite interesting was I would be walking on the way to work, down the street, and would be trying to do the _mettā_, and the inclination that would be there was, "Well, I don't want to kind of fill my mind with that. I want to let my mind be creative and let things come to me spontaneously." And then I had a kind of closer second look at kind of, well, what was coming up in my mind if I just let it be? And it wasn't really that creative. [laughter] You know, most thoughts, you've thought them at least a thousand times before. How many thoughts do you actually have that you've never thought before? How many thoughts do you actually have that are truly helpful? I mean, when you really look at it, it's not that many. And so, once I began to see that, it's like, "I'm fine replacing all that junk with the _mettā_." And the mind actually, slowly, it becomes less enticed by all this other stuff that can feel - we can feel so, "Well, I _need_ to think that, I just _need_ to think that," or "I need to let my mind go in some way." It becomes less enticing. The hindrances, and the seduction of the hindrances, and their story - like I said this morning, what they build up - becomes gradually less enticing as the _samādhi_ develops, very gradually. | <span class="blockid">8-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Metta phrases are more helpful than a lot of the other thoughts we have during the day\|Metta phrases are more helpful than a lot of the other thoughts we have during the day]]<br/><hr class="cell">When we're doing the mettā practice, what we're actually doing is replacing all that mess of negative thought that's so often around, replacing that with actually thoughts that are skilful, that are helpful, that are calming and conducive to calm. It's actually difficult to have the mettā phrases going and be really, _really_ involved in something else. I, some years ago, took on as a practice to do the mettā phrases all day, no matter what I was doing, as much as possible - not if I was talking to someone, but just going down the street, or in the shower, or whatever it was. I think it was a few months I did it for, and to really take it on. At first, I noticed there was, "Oh, well, I'd rather be thinking about (whatever it was)", and then I sort of began to give a closer look to what it was that my mind sort of spent its time thinking about. And generally, it wasn't particularly interesting. I don't know if your mind is anything like mine, but it was really not very interesting! [laughter] It was extremely uncreative. I can't even count how many times I had the same thoughts. Very unoriginal, not at all helpful generally. And so very shortly into this time of sort of ongoing mettā practice, I just thought, "Actually, to have the mettā phrases is just way nicer, way more helpful, just a much better thing to have, a much better inner environment." |

And if the mindfulness is there, you can catch this moment of wanting to see: "Who's that? Who's arriving? Who's going? What's happening?" [laughs] And if the mindfulness is bright enough, is present enough, you can just say, "I don't need to know. I don't need to know." Does it really matter what kind of car is coming up the drive?

And it really is for most people an acquired taste. It _sounds_ great. I don't know, maybe you're listening and thinking it sounds really boring.

Is it really ... is there going to be that much payoff from thinking it?" So as it develops, you can begin to catch this and just let things go, just let things go. _Samādhi_ and letting go are two sides of the same coin. They're two sides of the same coin.

Does it make much difference to my sense of well-being that I know it was a red Ford Escort that went by? Or whatever. Or it was so-and-so that came through. It really doesn't make any difference. And so we learn. The compulsion of things that we're so addicted to, it begins to just lose - in a very real way, a very in-the-moment way, not in an abstract way: not interested.

So that's why I'm mentioning this. But again, saying some things today that will apply for the whole retreat. For some people, the _samādhi_ develops, and something begins to (how to put it?) _arise_ in the experience, and it's called _pīti_. So some of you may have heard this word; it's another Pali word, _pīti_. And it really means any pleasant physical sensation that arises, you could say, from meditation. So anything at all - could be just a feeling of warmth or comfort, or sometimes tingling, or lightness, or pleasure, or heart-opening, or sort of a rising feeling, opening, expanding. It can be all - a whole range of what it actually is in terms of experience, but also a range of how strong it is. So sometimes, for some people, its _unbearably_ strong; it's really like a lightning bolt of ecstasy, just "_Pleugh_, it's _too_ much!" I don't know how common that is, you know, statistically. I don't know, but it can happen. And the other extreme is something really not that remarkable, that you're not going to be rushing to write a postcard to your friend saying, "Guess what happened to me today?" It's just some nice feeling of comfort and well-being and pleasure in the body. But all of that is _pīti_. | <span class="blockid">9-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Piti\|Piti]]<br/><hr class="cell">Okay. As this collectedness begins to deepen in the being - probably not for everyone, but for some people at some time - there can arise what's called pīti in Pali. That's usually translated as 'rapture.' And this goes back to what I was talking about, if there's a feeling of enjoyment in the body, no matter how subtle or quiet it seems, how 'not so much of a big deal.' Sometimes this pīti, this feeling in the body, can be extremely strong, so strong that it's uncomfortably strong. The whole body starts shaking with it, and just really off-the-scale ecstasy. It's quite rare, but it certainly does happen. And there's a whole range. |
|  | <span class="blockid">9-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#The range of piti\|The range of piti]]<br/><hr class="cell">So basically I'm just talking about - and again, not to grasp all this stuff, but just to introduce -there's a whole range of what's available in this word, pīti, from just a very quiet sense of pleasant feeling in the body (and that may be located in the body; it may be throughout the body), to really strong, overwhelming waves of ecstasy or bliss. And it's a whole range. It could be like a kind of tingling, or it could be a feeling of lightness, a very pleasant lightness, or expansion that feels very lovely, or warmth. |
|  | <span class="blockid">9-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Centre the practice around the nice feeling which comes with metta\|Centre the practice around the nice feeling which comes with metta]]<br/><hr class="cell">Not to grasp at this, but just to know that this, when it comes - and again, this is not permanent; it can't stay forever, but if it comes and when it comes, to open to that as much as possible. Even if it's very quiet. And usually it _is_ very quiet. But just to really allow that in, and actually let the mind go there, and let the mind go into that. So in the mettā practice, it might be typical for a nice feeling to be in the heart area, centred around the heart area. And so, to really let that nice feeling be part of the practice. In a way, to centre the practice around that nice feeling, _in_ that nice feeling, in that pleasantness, in that enjoyment. To centre it in it, and also to open the being to the enjoyment. Sometimes the enjoyable feeling, as I say, it may be in the heart area, or maybe the face, in the head. Maybe it fills the whole body, and we can sometimes _allow_ it to fill the whole body. |

It's really an art, and it's a lifelong art. So please, not to grasp at any of this. It's part of the whole terrain, and sometimes it's a little strange to hear about things if we haven't experienced them, and we think, "Oh, I should have," or "When will I?" or "That's the only thing that's important" or something. But just to paint a bit more of a big picture. And to be okay with having a sense of where things may unfold. That's just the beginning, and really there are infinite depths of samādhi. It's really an infinite journey into depth, and a whole range of states and states of consciousness that can open up. |
| <span class="blockid">11-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Piti arises from the mind rubbing against the object\|Piti arises from the mind rubbing against the object]]<br/><hr class="cell">Sometimes it gets translated as 'rapture,' sometimes 'ecstasy' (which is a little strong, but can be), 'bliss,' whatever. It arises partly from the _samādhi._ You can think of it as the mind just - this is not a very good analogy, but the mind rubbing against the object over and over, so rubbing and rubbing against the _mettā_, against the phrases. And there are kind of _sparks_ that comes from that. As the mind is less scattered, it's like it's actually, literally, _throwing out_ less energy. When we go, "Tomorrow, yesterday, worried about this, worried about _da-da-da-da_," you're throwing away energy all the time. The mind gets less scattered, and it's actually _collecting_ energy. And that energy begins to manifest. It begins to manifest physically - for some people. I'm just mentioning this as something that _may_ come into your experience. Not a big deal if it doesn't at all. Not a big deal if it doesn't. Not a big deal if it does. But it's worth knowing about. | <span class="blockid">10-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#1 Piti is a kind of energy\|1. Piti is a kind of energy]]<br/><hr class="cell">So what allows this pīti, this rapture? What allows that? What encourages that? One of the ways, and the sort of most traditional way, is that the mind is _with_ its object - either the breath or the mettā or the phrases - and it's sort of, in one way of thinking about it, it's like rubbing, two sticks rubbing against. The mind is rubbing against the object, and the friction causes the sparks, and the sparks are the pleasant feeling. I think that's traditional - I hope I didn't make it up! [laughter] So that's the traditional way: the mind, instead of being scattered, it begins, because of the collectedness, to actually gather energy. When it's scattered, the energy is being pulled. Pīti, that pleasantness, that rapture, is actually a kind of energy. And so, with the collectedness there, the mind begins to gather energy in a very organic, natural way. And then that energy expresses itself as pleasantness. |
| <span class="blockid">11-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Interest; openess\|Interest; openess]]<br/><hr class="cell">Sometimes it comes out of interest. When the interest is there, when we're really interested in this moment of _mettā_, or this moment of experience, it can lead to this. Sometimes just comes because there's energy there, and there's just energy, and it's beginning to express. _Pīti_ also comes - it has a lot to do with openness, openness of being. So usually, we tend - in the tradition, it's tended to regard _pīti_ as coming out of concentration, and certainly it does. The more steady we are - it _can_ come out of that. But actually, _pīti_ is - interestingly, it has more to do with openness of being. And so that's why some people, when they listen to music, there's openness of being, and something happens. Or you're in nature, and you're just there, and you're open, and there's a feeling coming in - sometimes. | <span class="blockid">10-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#2 Interest\|2. Interest]]<br/><hr class="cell">Interest is very related to pīti. When we're really interested in the meditation, interested in the feeling, interested in the phrases, that interest lends itself to pīti. Sometimes the word pīti is translated as 'interest.' So they're very related. And we can notice this even outside of meditation: when we're really into something, actually, if you check, there's a feeling of pleasantness. "Ahh," really interested. Usually it's very quiet outside of meditation, but there's that feeling of pleasantness. And so to tune into and allow and enjoy. |
|  | <span class="blockid">10-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#3 Openess of being\|3. Openess of being]]<br/><hr class="cell">Openness of being. Openness of being is really very, very conducive to this rapture. So what does that mean? Finding what that means. Just that the energy is open, the life is open, the receptivity is open. This is why nature and everything that I talked about earlier is important. It brings an openness of being, as if the channels are then open, and those channels can allow this movement of pīti. |
| <span class="blockid">11-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Non-entanglement\|Non-entanglement]]<br/><hr class="cell">'Non-entanglement' is a good word. So when the mind, when the consciousness is not so entangled with things, then that allows this _pīti_ - _can_ allow _pīti_. When there's _mettā_ there, it's actually a state of non-entanglement. There's kindness there. We're not embroiled in experience in the moment in an unhelpful way, and it can allow this. Now, if we're talking about _samādhi_ on a retreat like this, you actually want to encourage that. So any kind of comfortable, pleasant feeling - and this may seem like, "Wow, that's never going to happen," on your third, second day or whatever it is of the retreat. It's like, "I don't know _what_ you're talking about." Again, I'm pointing at something for the whole retreat. But it's actually something you want to encourage. So any kind of pleasantness, sense of well-being, sense of comfort, pleasure in the body, physical, you want to encourage. It's part of the practice, and you want to kind of mix it in with what's going on. And _pīti_ is actually just the first stage of other stages - of joy and peacefulness and stuff. We won't go into that. | <span class="blockid">10-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#4 Non-entanglement with things\|4. Non-entanglement with things]]<br/><hr class="cell">When we get down to it, it's actually a non-entanglement with things. That's the fundamental cause for arising of pīti. When the mind is not pushing, pulling, obsessing, grappling with things, then there can be that pīti. And again, that has very much something to do with mettā, because mettā is a non-struggle. Mettā towards experience is a non-struggle with experience. And as I said, we'll be going into that aspect of mettā as the weeks go by. |

It actually _doesn't_ lead to attachment in the long term. It might if one just has one or two isolated experiences, but as one develops it over time, it does not lead to attachment. The pleasure of meditation does not lead to attachment. It does not lead to attachment. So if there's any kind of - even if it's unremarkable - sense of enjoying the practice, really let yourself enjoy it. See if you can bring that in and mix it in with what's going on.

Go ahead and _get_ attached to it. _Get_ attached." And I'd never heard anything like this before, so I was like, "_Really_?" [laughter] And of course he proved totally right. It's actually fine to get attached to this. The being matures, the consciousness matures, and it lets go of that attachment. Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Enjoy it if there's something to enjoy. Oftentimes the people that make a big fuss about getting attached to pleasure in meditation don't seem to make too much fuss about all kinds of _other_ attachments that are in their life - you know, great food, a nice house to live in, you know, whatever else it is. And that goes unchallenged, and yet the attachment in meditation gets challenged a lot. I think that's a little backwards. Not to mention all the unhealthy stuff inwardly, the self-criticism, etc., that we can get attached to. |  |
| <span class="blockid">12-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Fear can come up\|Fear can come up]]<br/><hr class="cell">Sometimes we - and please keep a lot of this in ... As I keep saying, for the whole retreat, just keep it in mind as possibilities. Sometimes there's a sense of opening up and deepening in the meditation - and pleasure, even. And it's unfamiliar, and fear comes up. And this is very, very common. Sometimes we're meditating, and the fear is really strong. We're in very unfamiliar territory, and it's like, "_What_ is going on? Bring back normality, please." That's okay. When that happens, just go to the fear and work with the fear in terms of being with the fear as you probably all know how to do in terms of _vipassanā_. But sometimes, what happens is a kind of interesting in-between state: there's some degree of opening and enjoyment, and we feel like, "Oh, I'm opening into something new here," and there's pleasure, and the fear as well. And we're sort of - got both things going on. Unfortunately, how often the mind gets pulled like a magnet into the fear. And does it have to? If the fear's not that strong, it's possible - just take a step back, say, "I've got two things going on," not push away the fear, but just incline towards what's pleasurable, what's enjoyable in the experience, and just lean that way. And the very enjoying of it will help the fear to just subside. It's a matter, again, of an acquired taste, of getting used to it. So, slowly, slowly it's like just learning that we can trust that in meditation. | <span class="blockid">10-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#There can be some fear in there\|There can be some fear in there]]<br/><hr class="cell">So this pīti when it's there, it's very much to be encouraged. Very much to be encouraged this openness, this interest, this everything that allows pīti. For some people, for _many_ people, actually, when the mind begins to settle in samādhi, or even also this pīti when it comes, it can actually bring fear. It can be quite fearful. The Buddha, one of the five most prominent fears that the Buddha listed was fear of unusual mind states. [laughs] It _is_ unusual. When the mind begins - we're just not used to it, the mind settling down. And so there can be some fear in there. And just to know that's really okay. And if there's a breadth of awareness, we can be, "Ah, the mind is settling," I'm aware of that, and I'm also aware, as I said, of my emotion about the practice. Maybe it's fear. Can I then, without pushing away the fear, just very gently incline the mind towards the pleasantness of the depth? Just very gently. We don't need to push anything away. And so the mind gets slowly, slowly used to the new terrain. |
| <span class="blockid">12-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#We might also fear to losing one's self\|We might also fear to losing one's self]]<br/><hr class="cell">Sometimes that fear comes up because there's a softening as we do the _mettā_ and as the _samādhi_ goes. The self softens; the sense of self actually softens and begins to - not completely dissolve, but just get less defined. There's less of a sense of a 'doer.' And sometimes the fear that this brings up can be very strong - fear of death. It's very related to losing one's self at death. Very common, very important as part of the practice. And we're learning different experiences of the self. We're learning to let go of the rigid way we've bound ourselves to a self-view, both through the _samādhi_ and through the _mettā_. And this happens, and it's very important. | <span class="blockid">11-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#It's a lifelong exploration\|It's a lifelong exploration]]<br/><hr class="cell">Everything I'm speaking about today, samādhi, it's really speaking about this whole retreat. So some of it may not seem relevant on the second full day of a retreat. That's fine. It's for the whole retreat, and actually the whole of our life. As I said, this is a lifelong exploration. So just to hold it as something for now and for always. |
|  | <span class="blockid">11-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Quality of softness\|Quality of softness]]<br/><hr class="cell">Samādhi, as I said, has this quality of softness to it. One of the things that begins to soften with samādhi is the sense of the body, the body softening. The boundaries of the body begin to soften, _can_ begin to soften. What can also begin to soften is the sense of self. Usually we have a very fixed, rigid kind of sense: "I am _here_, I stop _here,_ and you begin _there,_ and this is _not_ me." The whole sense of self, or self-image, is quite fixed, rigid, and set. |
|  | <span class="blockid">11-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#The softening of the sense of self can be an existential fear\|The softening of the sense of self can be an existential fear]]<br/><hr class="cell">As the samādhi and also the mettā deepens - both, both together - the sense of self can begin to soften, can really begin to attenuate some more. There can be less of a sense of a 'doer,' a 'meditator.' And this, too, may bring up a lot of fear at times. It can be a fear, an existential fear of disappearing, similar to a fear of death. This is not at all uncommon. Some people don't get it at all, and then it's fine, not a problem. But some people do. But again, it's okay, and we can gradually work with this. It doesn't have to be a problem. |

Instead of just one view of self that we have and we're stuck there, and this is where it is and it's rigid, we begin to let go of that and open up to different ways of seeing the self. Who am I, if I'm not caught in some issue, caught in some views or thinking? Who am I when the thinking - if it calms down, am I still me? Am I the same me that I thought I was? |
| <span class="blockid">12-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Love comes from doing samadhi practice\|Love comes from doing samadhi practice]]<br/><hr class="cell">Okay, I'm just ... almost finished. As this happens, the _samādhi_ deepens, and there's less of a fixed, less of a sort of defined sense of self - there's actually more love that's coming out of the _samādhi_. So _samādhi -_ you know, love comes from doing _mettā_ practice. Love _also_ comes from doing insight practice, if you're doing it well, and right. Love also comes from doing _samādhi_ practice. So as the _samādhi_ deepens, the self softens. Love comes out of that, and it _should_ come out of that - love for the self, love for others, love for nature, for all things, for all beings. That's a kind of mark of _samādhi_ as it deepens. And I _have_ known, occasionally, people to be able to go into deep states of _samādhi_ and actually do it without this sense of openness and receptivity and love, and what they end up with is something that's very fragile. So in one case I'm remembering, a person that was on retreat long-term - I wasn't working with them - and they were here long-term, doing this kind of practice, but in a way that wasn't really receptive and open, didn't really have a lot of love in it. And then they hit a quite ... definitely a very challenging health crisis, and it all, the whole practice just went out the window, just completely crumbled. And partly, the reason was it didn't have this softness in it, didn't have that love and that receptivity in it. They were actually going about it in the wrong way. But generally, the _samādhi_ naturally has the love in it. | <span class="blockid">11-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi should have love in it\|Samadhi should have love in it]]<br/><hr class="cell">So when the sense of self attenuates, this has a lot to do with the sense of love, because when there's too much of a separation between self and other, that's perhaps the primary block to love flowing. Love, in a way, is that coming together, communion. Samādhi, anyway, should, I very strongly feel, it should have love in it. Somehow when the mind collects, calms, deepens like that, there should be a quality of love in it: love for oneself, love for others, love for nature, love for all things. |
|  | <span class="blockid">11-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Receptivity and an openess to some kind of wonder in being\|Receptivity and an openess to some kind of wonder in being]]<br/><hr class="cell">There should also be this quality of receptivity that I was talking about, just an openness to some kind of wonder in being. Occasionally I've come across people where that isn't the case. Somehow the mind is really, really, really settling down, getting very focused, getting very still, very deep, and there aren't those qualities of love, of receptivity. A person is moving around, and there's no sense of openness to nature, a connection. There's no sense of connection with the people practising around one. And what I've seen is that that doesn't really bear the fruit. It doesn't really bear the fruit. And in one case, there was someone practising for a long time in this way, without that receptivity and love. And then a situation changed, and there were quite some difficult health issues, very difficult health issues, understandably challenging. But the whole practice went out the window, completely. Not only in terms of as a resource, but actually as a practice. It just stopped. And I feel that for samādhi to really go deep in a way that it's really making an impact deep in the being, there has to be that love and receptivity there. |

It's not to rush to too soon an answer, and assume that I _must_ be suppressing. |

It's very interesting what's going on. So just, can we really bring an investigation to this? I remember at least ten years ago - more. Twelve? I can't remember. I was at an evening class of meditation in the States. And there had been a situation of a person that I knew who had been (what to say?) very criminal, was doing some criminal stuff, and it involved me and some other people. And I was feeling really angry about this, and I had uncovered this over time. There was a lot of anger around, over a period of time, and really trying to be with this anger and work with it. And one evening at this meditation class, I was just meditating, and there was some degree of _samādhi_ - nothing particularly deep or _jhānic_ or extraordinary, but just some degree of collectedness. And into that, the memory of this person, the image of this person came up. And it was very clear. There was a lot of clarity there. I could see: the image came up, and a _moment_ of the anger, a _moment_ of it. But what wasn't there was - it didn't spark into anything bigger. Like usually, [it would be] quite a big anger and a big whole feeling of that. And it just came up, and it was anger, and it just ... nothing came of it. It's like nothing - it was a spark that didn't ignite a fire. | <span class="blockid">12-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Example story because of samadhi there weren't the conditions there for anger\|Example story: because of samadhi there weren't the conditions there for anger]]<br/><hr class="cell">I remember years ago, I had been in a certain kind of relationship with someone. It was actually a teaching relationship with someone, and they were _my_ teacher. It's a long story, but there was a lot of anger there. I felt a lot of anger. The relationship had ended, and there was a lot of anger. And I went to practise one evening at a meditation centre, and got quite calm. There was some samādhi there, nothing particularly deep. The memory of this person came up, and the beginnings of anger. And instead of going off into the whole big production of anger and all the fullness of that, and all the story and everything, because of the samādhi, there was just a moment of anger - no sense of repression - and it didn't actually go into anything else. Because of the samādhi, there was a clarity, and I actually saw: "Ah! This is something very significant." It's _not_ that - the assumption might be that "This is what's happening. We're angry, and the anger is kind of living in me, in my heart, in my psyche, waiting to come out. I _need_ to express this." It was rather that, because of the samādhi, because of the settledness of mind, there weren't the conditions there for that anger to arise in the present - which is a very different understanding, and has huge implications about our emotional life as human beings. It has _huge_ implications. |

It's sort of a story of a non-event, but it's actually a huge impression it made on me. And there was a work retreatant here a while ago dealing with some difficult experiences, and she was also experiencing some _samādhi_ and some calmness, and I said to her, "When the _samādhi_'s around, take a risk: drop in the thoughts of what's difficult. Just remember what it is that's causing you difficulty and anxiety, whatever it is, just drop that into the calmness and the _samādhi_. See what happens." And she came back and she said, "I did, and nothing happened. Dropped it in. Nothing happened." Nothing ignited. Nothing got built up. What I realized, and what she realized from that - something that we take as a given, as something that needs to come up, in this case the anger (I can't actually remember what her emotion was), it needs us to build it up. It needs conditions to be there. And in that moment, when I was in the meditation, it didn't have the conditions to create it. So we _can_ tend to think, "Here is a storehouse of old emotions" - I'm treading very delicately here. I don't want to come down on one side or the other. I just want to expose this area. I'm not saying one of them. I'm just saying, "Have a look at it a bit more clearly." We tend to think of a storehouse of old emotions: "Here's anger. I need to release it. I need it to come up." But it cannot come up unless the conditions in the Present moment are there for it to come up. And sometimes when we're really clear, we can actually see this process, that if we don't feed it in the present, it doesn't come up. It _cannot_ come up. | <span class="blockid">12-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Excercise if calmness is there drop in the thought of a difficult issue\|Excercise: if calmness is there, drop in the thought of a difficult issue]]<br/><hr class="cell">Similarly, there was a work retreatant here a while ago who was experiencing some calmness and also some periods of real struggle with issues.

Just drop it into the calmness like a drop in the still water. And just see what happens. So she did that, went away and did that, and came back. Nothing happened. And she was so shocked almost by that. Why does nothing happen? Because the conditions aren't there. The anger, the issue that we think lives whole, ready inside of us, needing to come up, the conditions aren't there in the moment for it to be there. |

They're empty of inherent existence. They don't exist by themselves. They don't have self-existence. They need me to do something in the present. They're not lurking in there, waiting to rear their ugly heads in fully blown form. It's not how it works. We actually need to see this over and over and over for it to become really clear. | <span class="blockid">12-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Issues are empty of inherent existence\|Issues are empty of inherent existence]]<br/><hr class="cell">It's a very different understanding, very significant. So what that means is the issues that we - we have to be delicate with this; you can't make it a black or white thing. I just want to introduce the question, because sometimes things _are_ there, and they _do_ need to come up. But oftentimes the issues that we think are so real, so compelling and so needing to come up - they don't come up, because the conditions aren't there. And we see this with samādhi. They're, we say in Dharma language, empty of inherent existence. They don't exist by themselves. We usually need to see this over and over. So probably, as I'm saying it, it doesn't sound that significant. But we see this over and over with samādhi, and actually it's something very, very deeply significant. |
| <span class="blockid">14-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Samadhi is actually making less and less self\|Samadhi is actually making less and less (self)]]<br/><hr class="cell">So usually we tend to think of _samādhi_ as, I'm kind of - "Here I am, trying to keep my _samādhi_ together. I'm trying to keep the _mettā_ practice. I'm _doing_ something. I'm _making_ something there." As we go into it, we see that _samādhi_ is actually making less and less. We're doing less and less. It's very, very interesting - it's not obvious at all. As we make less and less, we make less and less self, and there's more and more love coming out of that. We begin to see this emptiness of things. It comes out of the _mettā_ practice and out of the _samādhi_ practice. Begin to see that things cannot be 'things' without me _doing_ something, without me actually faffing around a lot, and putting a lot, and building them up in there. And it's this seeing of emptiness - and you see it in a very gradual way. It's not really a sudden thing. It's a very gradual, over and over - it's this seeing and understanding of emptiness that brings the deepest freedom in life and in our practice. And that's something that _is_ available to us through these practices. | <span class="blockid">12-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#With samadhi we are creating less and less\|With samadhi we are creating less and less]]<br/><hr class="cell">We tend to think of samādhi as we're _creating_ something, we're _creating_ this calmness, we're _creating_ this nice state or whatever. Actually, when we really practise, and we really look at the question of samādhi, you understand it's the opposite: we spend our lives creating things. We spend our lives creating a lot of problems, often, and samādhi, we're beginning to _stop_ creating things. We're creating less and less. |
|  | <span class="blockid">13-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Things that we create cause barriers and with metta samadhi we are creating less\|Things that we create cause barriers, and with metta samadhi we are creating less]]<br/><hr class="cell">As we go deeply into the nature of love, too, we actually see we're creating less and less when we're doing mettā, and it's the things that we create that cause barriers. When we create less and less through the mettā practice, through the samādhi, we actually see: there's love there. It leads to love because we're creating less barriers. |
|  | <span class="blockid">13-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#Awakening to emptiness\|Awakening to emptiness]]<br/><hr class="cell">So this question - I'm just touching on it briefly now - this question of the emptiness of things and seeing that through the mettā practice, seeing that through samādhi, it's hugely significant. I mean, it's probably _the_ most significant thing in the Dharma, actually. When we talk about awakening, that's really what it is: it's awakening to emptiness, and what does that mean, and what's the effect on the being and the effect on the heart. So we'll be talking hopefully as the retreat goes on much more about this and the place of love in discovering the meaning of that. |
|  | <span class="blockid">13-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Samadhi in Metta Practice#The emptiness brings freedom gradually\|The emptiness brings freedom, gradually]]<br/><hr class="cell">But to understand - and it's usually a gradual, slow understanding - to understand this emptiness brings freedom gradually, slowly, and that's the freedom that the Buddha was pointing to. And it doesn't have to be this sudden, you know, lightening strike under the bodhi tree. It can be just a gradual or sudden movement into freedom that's actually very available, very accessible to all of us. It's really a potential for us as human beings in a very real way. |

| <span class="blockid">14-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#The phrases are really a crutch\|The phrases are really a crutch]]<br/><hr class="cell">Rob: Yes, good, good. Yeah. So I'll repeat this anyway at some point, but the phrases are really a crutch. Sometimes you're going to really need the phrases and the fullness of the phrases, and this kind of steadiness of the phrases, and the concreteness of the phrases. And as I've said, at some point yesterday or today, if the mind feels quite scattered, even good to say each phrase twice. You're sort of there for the first one, and then the second one, you're really there. |  |
| <span class="blockid">14-7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Your need for the phrases changes\|Your need for the phrases changes]]<br/><hr class="cell">As the _samādhi_ deepens or the feeling of _mettā_ deepens, you will find that your need for the phrases changes. So sometimes you don't need any phrase at all, and there's a feeling there, and you feel warm, and there's love. Just be with that. Just be with that in the body, and just let the phrases go. But it's a continuum. You can be in this not saying any phrases as long as it lasts like that, as long as you can stay connected. When it fades, come back to the phrases. There's a sort of in-between, when you might find the phrases can be a lot more light and a lot more sparse. In other words, you can - what are the phrases again? "May I be safe." [laughter] "Safe and protected," sorry. Or "May I live with ease." That's one. [laughter] That might become just one word, so instead of "May I live with" or "May I _da-da-da_" or "May you _da-da-da,_" it just becomes "ease ... ease ... ease." And it can become _very_ sparse, even less regular than that. You can be very fluid. This is a very fluid, very responsive practice. One of the skills in _samādhi_ practice, one of the skills in _mettā_ practice, is responsiveness. So what is the way of using the phrases or leaving the phrases that's most helpful right now for you? That's it. In the art of what's going on is this responsiveness to more, less, tighter, looser. Does that answer? Yeah? Good, good. So very important, really important. |  |

So not to kind of rush to a conclusion either way. In what you just said, it was interesting the language that you used. So when there are certain conditions, up it comes. |  |

So in other words, what I'm saying is, anger can't be anger, a behaviour can't be a behaviour, without us building it in the Present moment. |  |
| <span class="blockid">15-9</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Begin to understand what are the conditions that build things in the present moment\|Begin to understand what are the conditions that build things in the present moment]]<br/><hr class="cell">Rob: I think it's just an interesting thing to look at. I mean, so rather than trying to come to a conclusion now, maybe you could just investigate that. I think it's an ongoing question, because sometimes the model of a storehouse and things needing to come up is really appropriate and really important, and very much a skilful way of working. But to deepen in understanding in the Dharma, one of the most central things is actually deepening in understanding what are the conditions that build things in the Present moment. And we begin to uncover that more and more as the practice deepens. Usually, it's not a way we're used to looking, so we don't usually look that way. But to begin to actually tease them out and see, "Okay, so what was actually contributing to that?" It's something that takes time, but you may just want to keep it open right now and just explore. See what you see about it. |  |

And if we can just approach this with a very open, fresh mind, no preconceptions, and just see: "Am I assuming that it's gone into hiding - it's actually there, but I just can't see it? Or is it really not there? Is it really not there? There are times in our life when we are actually repressing things and suppressing things. There's something around that we don't want to deal with, we don't want to feel, and it's pushing it down. But a lot of the times, when things are not there, there's the assumption that they're in hiding or repressed or just out of the range of consciousness. And that's what I'm saying. Can we just approach that differently? |  |

Yeah, and that's, I think, really, really skilful, and a beautiful thing to do. Someone was saying this to me in another retreat the other day, "I just want to put all that self-definition aside and just see what's what," and put it away for a while. Maybe put it away for longer. Maybe you put it away, and it comes back. But if you keep putting it away over and over, maybe when it comes back it doesn't have the kind of total convincingness that it seems to most of the time. In other words, sure it comes back, but we don't automatically just totally believe that about ourselves, that we're like this - either how we're telling ourselves how we are, or how other people are telling us. There's a sense of moving in and out of defining the self, as practice deepens. So of course we live our life defining the self to our self and to others, but we have times when we don't, and those are beautiful times, precious times. You can't stay forever in a state of not defining the self, but if you do it enough and repeatedly enough, when you go back to defining the self, you just know, "Well, this is just a conventional definition," and you're not bound by it. You don't feel wedded to it. Does that make sense? Its believability is that much less. It's just, "Yeah, sure, I'll define myself. I do this, I do that, I'm like this, I'm like that." But it's not imprisoning the being in any way. You understand? So yeah, very beautiful. Thank you. |  |

Over time, what happens, the more and more skilled you become, the more you can actually catch that process of, "Here they are, these little things going out looking, and they're looking for something." Before they've got their teeth sunk in something, you can actually just, "Oh, thank you very much, and we won't be going there." [laughter] But don't feel, if you miss that moment, it's all, "_Ugh_, now I've missed it, missed the train. I have to wait for the next. I have to sit this out." It's not quite like that. And actually, two things happen. |  |
| <span class="blockid">18-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#The knowledge of the process of being created helps to defuse it\|The knowledge of the process of being created helps to defuse it]]<br/><hr class="cell">One thing is, over time, you've seen it enough, and even in the middle of it you know, "Well, this is a process that's (take it lightly) somewhat unreal. It's kind of created. I've made this, somehow. It's not as real as it seems to be." And just that knowledge helps to lessen its impact. Does that make sense? So that becomes stronger and stronger, more and more embedded. We believe less in the stories that hindrances and aversion, etc., are telling us, because we've seen it over and over, how they build things, how they want to make [issues], and we believe it less. So that helps defuse, even if you're in the middle of it. |  |
| <span class="blockid">18-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Alternatively come back to a very simple level of the practice or just be with the unpleasantness\|Alternatively, come back to a very simple level of the practice, or just be with the unpleasantness]]<br/><hr class="cell">Secondly, it's possible, even if you're in the middle of it, to find a way of working that's simpler. For instance, just keeping doing the _mettā_. You're just coming back to a very simple level instead of trying to engage with the complexity of this sort of raging fire or the complexity of all this difficulty that's going on. Instead of trying to address it at that level, trying to address it at a much simpler level, just keeping doing the _mettā_ and staying very simple with that, or possible also to just be with the unpleasantness of what's going on. So once these hooks are in something, they're shaking something, it's probably going to be agitated and unpleasant. You can just feel that energetically, physically, as an unpleasantness, and just stay with that unpleasantness. It's a very simple stratum of experience to be with. If you stay there and just let it be unpleasant, you're not building it any more. Does that make sense? So two ways there. Good? Okay, great. |  |

Because you were talking about the mind tightening up, and I am, as you know, extremely tired, and effort kind of sends me straight to sleep, as people might have noticed. And yet, how to arrive at kind of effortless - I wonder, how can one arrive at effortless effort? In other words, how little can one do and still make enough effort for the practice to work? |  |
| <span class="blockid">18-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Be willing to experiment with the whole range of it\|Be willing to experiment with the whole range of it]]<br/><hr class="cell">Rob: Yeah. Um. [laughs] Golden question. I don't think there's one answer to that, unfortunately. I don't think it's that simple. In the course of practice, and in the course of a retreat like this, it's more like, "How willing am I to experiment with the whole range of it?" Sometimes what really is needed is this, "Right, okay, when the tough get going ..." What is it? "When the tough get going, the going gets ..." [laughter] "When the going gets tough" - thank you. You know, it's really just, you just stick in there, and you just say, "I'm just going to stick with this thing, and I'm just going to see it out," and it pays off. And it really is a question of effort. And that's kind of one extreme. At other times, it's more of just allowing and really non-efforting, and being very spacious and allowing, and _that_ seems to be the ticket. Again, it's this responsiveness, this creativity, this aliveness of response and relationship with the practice. And I think 'willingness' is a really important word - willing to try everything, even when we feel like, "I don't really want to try that end of things," or "That can't be right," you know? It's not the case that one thing is always going to work. It's just not. One day, one hour, one approach will work. The next hour, the very opposite. So it's more in this willingness to experiment, and willingness to sometimes do what you don't feel like doing, and sometimes it's very much the opposite. I wish it _was_ a very simple sort of, "There you are." But I don't think it is. I think it's really the whole range of that. But certainly the allowing the spaciousness, the letting go, is very significant. You can be letting go of a lot of aversion in that. Aversion has a lot to do with tiredness. When there's aversion around, it's just very tiring. So letting go, being spacious, actually allows that to just let go. |  |
| <span class="blockid">19-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Keep that willingness experimentation nurturing around\|Keep that willingness, experimentation, nurturing around]]<br/><hr class="cell">Rob: Okay. Yeah. It's still early days, you know. You've had a lot of challenging stuff in the life coming up. So, you know, you're settling in still. But if you keep that willingness around, and that [experimenting], and take care of the other piece I said about nurturing a sort of base level of happiness and appreciation - that may be as significant as efforting. This is really important. When we think about _samādhi_, the whole picture is important. Taking care of that, nurturing appreciation, gratitude, etc. - very significant. Yeah? Okay. |  |

In a way, as practice develops and deepens, it's a bit like riding currents, like if you see sometimes there are hawks around here, and you see them kind of gliding and riding the air currents. A positive mind state might come up - your child, a loved one, and there's love there. Now, it may be that that feels like a bit of a distraction. But it may be that you can also use that energy as something that feeds back into the _mettā_. |  |
| <span class="blockid">20-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#It's an energy that one can ride and navigate\|It's an energy that one can ride and navigate]]<br/><hr class="cell">Rob: Okay. If there's _mettā_ in it - in other words, it goes back to the phrases as well. If it feels like, "Oh, here in this memory of this person is _mettā_," then go with that. In other words, ride it as a manifestation of _mettā_, or pull the _mettā_ out of it. Does that make sense? There could be a lot of _mettā_ in what you're talking about; it's not just a distraction. Similarly, this morning we were talking about sexual energy and when there's fantasy coming up or whatever, opening to that energy and allowing that, feeling it physically, instead of being so much, "Oh, I need, I need, I want," or so much caught in the fantasy. It's an energy that one can actually ride and navigate. What seems like a distraction can actually be - you can work with it. So sometimes the mind moves, and it _is_ just looking for a distraction. But then it doesn't actually feel that good. So this is interesting. Again, if you have the sensitivity to the body, you can feel when it feels, "Ah, this is actually good. It's helping. It's helping this good feeling." And other times when it's just - it's not really helping. |  |

[laughter] This is England, after all. [laughter] But sometimes, you know, to let yourself do that. See if you can notice when it's coming out of restlessness and distraction and wanting just to entertain, and when it's actually coming out of wanting to look and appreciate. One begins, in time, to discern the difference. Does that make sense? So it may - it _will_ be the case that in _mettā_ positive feelings come up; just see if they can be kind of enjoyed and brought into the practice so that the _mettā_ itself deepens. Is that okay? Okay. Good. Let's have a bit of quiet together before tea. |  |
