But first, in a way, I want to review some of the salient features of what we've been doing so far. So at a very basic level, of course, we've been, we _are_ cultivating _mettā_, loving-kindness, cultivating loving-kindness, and cultivating compassion. And I don't think that I need to persuade anyone of the blessings of that at this point on the retreat. And so we see, through the cultivation, the blessings of doing this that come for self and for other. And if it's not clear yet what comes out towards other, it does get clear as we move into our life, our usual life. | <span class="blockid">1-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#We are cultivating metta and compassion and we can see the blessings that come from that\|We are cultivating metta and compassion, and we can see the blessings that come from that]]<br/><hr class="cell">Okay, so I want to talk a bit about love and emptiness, and pick up on what we introduced today in terms of practice. But first I think just a very brief sort of review of the show so far, sort of thing. And at this point, I don't think I need to sort of sell mettā any more to anyone - at least I hope not. But what are we doing here? We're cultivating mettā and compassion. And we can see, we can feel, here on the retreat and in our lives, the blessings that come from that, the gifts of doing that, for our selves, for our own lives, for our own being, and in the world, for others. |
| <span class="blockid">1-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Planting the seeds of intention to recondition the mind\|Planting the seeds of intention to recondition the mind]]<br/><hr class="cell">So to repeat the analogy that I've used many times, we're planting these seeds, planting the seeds of intention. And we're reconditioning the heart and the mind, which essentially, you could say, is a whirlpool, a web of conditioning, of conditions and habits of conditions. And we're reconditioning it slowly, patiently, gradually, and in that, through that, transforming the heart, transforming our intentions, so that the way we act in the world, what comes out of our mouth, our thoughts, all of that, is gradually, slowly transformed. Remember the Buddha's words: "Drop by drop the bucket is filled."^[Dhp 122] That's a very basic level of what we're doing. | <span class="blockid">1-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#In transforming the heart we're transforming our intentions in life\|In transforming the heart, we're transforming our intentions in life]]<br/><hr class="cell">So one way of looking at what's going on - it's a very helpful way, a very real way of looking at what's going on - is that we're reconditioning the mind and the heart. That's not a very appealing word maybe, 'reconditioning.' But we're transforming, we're cultivating qualities of the mind and the heart. We are planting seeds of intention, of love and compassion, and they bear fruit in their time. They bear fruit. And in transforming the heart, we're transforming our intentions in life. So that gradually, slowly, in a very non-linear way, over time, the way we act in the world, the choices that we make, what we put out into the world, is transformed, is reconditioned. The way we speak, the words we use, what we say, what we don't say, is transformed. And our thoughts and our intentions in life are transformed. And that's a very powerful thing, not to be underestimated. So that's one very important part of what's going on. |
| <span class="blockid">1-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#We are nurturing the best possible climate for our growth\|We are nurturing the best possible climate for our growth]]<br/><hr class="cell">Another aspect, or rather part of that, is that through cultivating loving-kindness and compassion, we're also nurturing and establishing the best possible climate for our growth: so psychological, emotional, spiritual growth. It's the best possible climate. And I know, if I reflect back on my past, trying at times to work very hard on understanding myself or on transforming myself, and yet not holding that process, not holding myself in that process in a climate of kindness. I was barely aware of it at the time. And what happens? Just running into a brick wall. Or it backfires in some way. And maybe there's some transformation. But the fullness of that will not be available. And so whatever growth we're talking about - meditative, spiritual, however - the loving-kindness and compassion are the best possible climate. | <span class="blockid">1-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#Through metta and compassion we are creating an ideal inner climate for growth\|Through metta and compassion we are creating an ideal inner climate for growth]]<br/><hr class="cell">Another part in the sort of big picture of our lives and our practice, what we're also doing is, through the mettā, through the compassion, creating a kind of ideal inner climate for growth. I know for myself there have been periods of time when I've been really trying very hard to grow, to understand myself, to understand life - but there wasn't that climate of love for oneself, wasn't a lot of climate of mettā. And it was like banging my head against a wall, really. The mettā, the compassion, are ideal, the ideal soil. |
| <span class="blockid">1-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Two wings for the path wholesome nourishment and investigation for insight\|Two wings for the path: wholesome nourishment and investigation for insight]]<br/><hr class="cell">When the Buddha described his path, the path that he set forth, it's interesting - he didn't teach that much about technique and meditation technique. There's a little bit, but it's not generally that common. Rather, what he does over and over is encourage us to strive for two things, to work to develop two things. **(1)** One is a **wholesome nourishment**, a wholesome sense of the being, the body, the mind, the heart, being nourished. And 'wholesome' meaning ways that don't lead to our harm or the harm of others. Wholesome nourishment - so what's in that? It's all these qualities: loving-kindness, compassion, generosity, equanimity, etc., mindfulness. And developing these qualities that give the being a really deep, really satisfying grounding in nourishment. It's like there's a reservoir inside. Slowly, slowly, there's a reservoir inside. And that wholesome nourishment is one aspect of what he encouraged. **(2)** And the other aspect is **investigation for insight**. And these two kind of wings of the path: developing what's beautiful for the nourishment, and then the investigation. | <span class="blockid">1-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#In practice wholesome nourishment and investigation support each other\|In practice, wholesome nourishment and investigation support each other]]<br/><hr class="cell">Third thing: the Buddha, in his way of teaching, he actually didn't teach too much about technique, and meditation technique and that sort of - maybe he did, and it hasn't really been recorded. But what he did, one thing that he emphasized over and over and over again, was a sort of approach to practice which was twofold. One part is a kind of wholesome nourishment. So nourishing the heart, nourishing the mind, the consciousness, the being, in the most wholesome way possible. And that's one half of the practice. And the other half is investigation, insight, looking into life, looking deeply and learning. And these two - wholesome nourishment and investigation, insight - support each other and they feed each other. And as an overall principle of what practice is about, that's a very good working model. |
| <span class="blockid">1-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Wholesome nourishment through metta and samadhi\|Wholesome nourishment through metta and samadhi]]<br/><hr class="cell">So, in a way, the _mettā_ is, again, part of that very deep wholesome nourishment. And the more we have of that, in a way, the freer we are in life. We are less dependent on others, less dependent on circumstances. We have enough. We have enough, and it's not cold. It's not uncaring or isolationist. It's just that we have enough, and it can flow over. Part of the wholesome nourishment is _samādhi_. So for me - I don't know how it seems for you - it seems like a long time ago that I spoke about _samādhi_. But I was hoping, talking about it at the beginning, that it would be something that we would keep in our minds, in the sort of back of our awareness for the whole retreat. And it's interesting: we come here for three weeks or longer, or whatever it is, and a lot of stuff happens. A lot of stuff happens in our experience. We go through a lot of stuff. There are a lot of aspects to what we're doing. We talk about love and compassion - there are a lot of aspects to that. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Questioning\|Questioning]]<br/><hr class="cell">One aspect, and I've talked on this, is questioning. So we question: "What is compassion, actually, when I really look at it? How is that different from, say, pity or whatever else? What is my attitude towards that? What blocks it?", etc. So there's a real questioning going on. That's very much a part of what's going on. And at times, as you all know, things come up for us. We find ourself in difficult territory, old feelings come up, or just feelings in the moment come up. We're struggling. Or it's just something charged, not even that much struggle. That, too, is part of the process. So there's the questioning. There is allowing ourselves to feel what needs to be felt at times, feeling the feelings. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Encouragement\|Encouragement]]<br/><hr class="cell">_And_ there's the encouragement, the nurturing, of the _samādhi_, which is actually a quietening of the questioning and a quietening of the turbulence of feelings, which sometimes seem like they really _demand_ to be felt, _demand_ to be looked at. So all that somehow needs to fit into the picture of what we're doing. Sometimes we're more questioning, sometimes we're more allowing what needs to bubble up, and sometimes we're just developing the _samādhi_ and letting things get quiet, developing that journey into the depth, into the stillness, into the subtlety. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Samadhi is one of the factors that allows the love and compassion to come into the cells\|Samadhi is one of the factors that allows the love and compassion to come into the cells]]<br/><hr class="cell">Now what I see - and this is kind of reviewing a bit what I said about _samādhi_ - is that most people that I come across in meditation circles tend not to give as much emphasis or believe as much in the importance of _samādhi_ as perhaps they should. It's almost like we don't quite trust that or give it as much weight. And so partly - I'm just refreshing - that's definitely a factor here for the depth and the depth of understanding, the depth of opening, the depth of transformation, as I said. _Samādhi_ is one of the factors. It's just one. So all the others are important. But it's one of the factors that allows the love and the compassion to kind of come into the cells. Something very visceral almost about it, very deep. But again, they're all important. All those aspects are important. To know what one's tendencies are. Is my tendency to avoid? What is it? |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Cultivation is not about self-improvement\|Cultivation is not about self-improvement]]<br/><hr class="cell">So there's this wholesome nourishment and insight, and we're kind of developing both in a lifetime of practice. With the cultivation of qualities that bring wholesome nourishment (one of which is _samādhi_, and loving-kindness, and compassion, etc.), very important to see that it's not about self-improvement. And how easily the judging mind comes in, the measuring mind comes in: "How am I doing?" And particularly with concepts like _samādhi_ or _mettā_ or compassion, whatever it is: "I have it. I don't have it. How am I in relation to others?" So it's really not about self-improvement, and the whole notion of a self to improve begins to just loosen in time with practice. And yet, we can still be really committed to this process of cultivation, of developing the nourishment, of reconditioning. And yet there's no self at the centre of it. No self at the centre of it, and yet we're totally committed. | <span class="blockid">1-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#We are cultivating qualities of mind and heart but there's no self in it\|We are cultivating qualities of mind and heart, but there's no self in it]]<br/><hr class="cell">So again, through the mettā, through the compassion, we're finding ways in our lives and in meditation of really nourishing ourselves very deeply in a very wholesome way - what the Buddha would call 'wholesome abiding' or 'skilful abiding,' to abide in mettā, to abide in compassion. And again, it's just important to mention (I've probably already said it, but): none of this is really about self-improvement, about me wanting to be a better person because I'm not good enough yet. That's not where it's coming from. We are re-cultivating qualities of mind and heart, and one can be fully committed to that engagement, fully committed to that transformation of the qualities of heart, fully committed to that, but there's no self in it. There's no measurement or comparing or "I should be better than I am." It's just gone. It's just not there as a potent force, and certainly not as a potent force for suffering. But the commitment to the cultivation is still there. |
| <span class="blockid">2-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#"Reconditioning" might be a dry word but it's an important part of what's going on\|"Reconditioning" might be a dry word, but it's an important part of what's going on]]<br/><hr class="cell">So this reconditioning is - it sounds such a mechanical and dry word, but it's actually a very important part of what's going on, as I said. I remember - it was a couple of years ago. I taught a day retreat on compassion in London. And in the question and answer period, a gentleman stopped me. Well, he didn't really - he asked a question. And he said, "Conditioning, conditioning, conditioning!" [laughs] He said, "All this conditioning - isn't it just going round in the circles of what's conditioned? How are you going to move, how is the mind going to move towards what's Unconditioned? And the Buddha talks about what's Unconditioned as the goal of the path. Aren't you just playing endlessly, fiddling with conditions?" [laughter] | <span class="blockid">2-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#The mind is conditions - there's nothing wrong with reconditioning it\|The mind is conditions - there's nothing wrong with reconditioning it]]<br/><hr class="cell">So there's this, whatever we want to call it, transformation, reconditioning. There's the climate for growth. There's the wholesome nourishment to balance with the insight. Some time ago, I think it was about a year ago, I was teaching a one-day retreat, and I was teaching it on compassion. And in the question and answer period, a man asked a question: "Well, okay, that's all very nice, but aren't you just reconditioning the mind? Aren't you just reconditioning? How will you penetrate through to the Unconditioned if all you're doing is recreating the conditions?" So I _think_ he was coming from an earnest place, and it's a good question - the Unconditioned being another word for the goal of practice, of nibbāna, liberation. And I can't remember exactly what I said to him, but we _are_ at one level, as I said, reconditioning the mind. There's nothing wrong with that. The mind _is_ conditions. The mind has these habits and grooves. And it can have a groove of irritability, a groove of judgment, a groove of self-criticism, and they're really deep, and they've been deepened over decades. And one thing that we're doing is reconditioning the mind. And there's every validity in that, if we're interested in a life that's more open, more peaceful, more happy. |
| <span class="blockid">3-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Recondition i e working on a relative level brings well-being and sets up conditions that lead to the Unconditioned\|Recondition (i.e. working on a relative level) brings well-being and sets up conditions that lead to the Unconditioned]]<br/><hr class="cell">I think he was coming from a genuine, caring place. [laughter] I'm actually not sure to this day. But there is, first of all, the importance of just that relative level, of just reconditioning the mind, as I said. At one level the mind, you could say - again, it's not a very glamorous image, but the mind is a web, a mass, a vortex, a spaghetti bowl of habits, of conditioning. And we _can_ begin to recondition that. Tremendous amount of freedom, well-being, peace, joy, etc., come out of that, just at the relative level. And that's absolutely fine and actually crucial. _And_ there is the conditioning, the setting up of conditions, the nurturing of conditions that actually leads to the Unconditioned. And actually in its deepening, and in its unfoldment, leads towards the Unconditioned, what is not conditioned, what is not born of conditions, what is not a condition. That's partly to do with what I'm going to talk about in this talk. I'll come back to that. | <span class="blockid">2-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#There is cultivation but also that we're actually getting out of the way\|There is cultivation, but also that we're actually getting out of the way]]<br/><hr class="cell">But then the Buddha also talks about the "conditioning that leads to the end of conditions." And this is quite important. Some cultivations and conditions actually do not just lead to more conditions - they lead to what the Buddha would call 'unbinding,' a letting go of conditions. So mettā, compassion, samādhi are three such cultivations, three such conditionings of the mind that actually move (over time, and slowly) toward the Unconditioned. So, I think I've already said this, but we can feel like we're here doing this practice, and we're sort of grinding away at the phrases and the mettā, and we're building loving-kindness and we're building compassion, and it's this fragile sort of structure that we're hoping to hold in place. But sometimes, a different sense of it is visible, which is that we're actually getting out of the way. We're doing less and less. And in that doing less and less, we are building less and less, building less and less barriers. And there's the love there. There's the compassion. And in a way, this process just goes deeper and deeper until what we would call the Unconditioned becomes 'visible,' if that's the word for it. |
| <span class="blockid">3-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#This practice softens the boundaries of the self\|This practice softens the boundaries of the self]]<br/><hr class="cell">So this is all still review, but last point. As we do _mettā_ and compassion practice - and many of you will have felt this to some degree, to any degree, any degree is good - that the sense of self can soften at times. And the actual self and the walls of the self, the boundaries of the self begin to soften, begin to be more open, more spacious, more permeable, in a way. And this is hugely important because we get a glimpse of living without this self-constriction, living without binding ourselves and defining ourselves and wrapping us up, wrapping ourselves up so much in the self. We begin to get a sense of perhaps oneness, or a flavour of this not-self, this no-self, this _anattā_. And so loving-kindness and compassion just lead naturally to a less fixed, less rigid, less tightly bound sense of self _at times_. At times it moves that way. And something in that opening, in that softening, begins to shake up and awaken some understanding about the self and the nature of the self. And again, giving compassion and love to oneself - it's not building up the ego. It's not building up the sense of self. And to explore this in our lives and in our practice - the way the sense of self gets built up, the way the ego gets built up, is through a _problematic_ relationship with the self, a judgmental, a critical, a harsh relationship with the self, a rigidly defined relationship with the self. Problematic self-view builds up the ego. And when we have _mettā_ towards our self, compassion towards our self, that actually begins to soften. So there's an easing of the sense of self - at times, at times - with these practices. | <span class="blockid">2-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#The walls that we usually feel in place begin to just dissolve a little bit \|The walls that we usually feel in place begin to just dissolve a little bit.]]<br/><hr class="cell">And then, as we've also talked over the time, through dedicated practice to love and compassion, there is, at times, possible, a sense of the separate self kind of dissolving a little bit to some extent. The boundaries, the barriers, the walls that we usually feel in place begin to just dissolve a little bit. And comes to some degree, into the practice, for a short period of time or a long period or whatever, a sense of oneness - that this sense of me and you, self and other, self and the world that we so take for granted, it just dissolves a little bit, and we have a different sense of life, a different perception of the reality of things. That can come, and it will go. It's a perception that can arise and fade. |
|  | <span class="blockid">2-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#Cultivating love and compassion eases the view of self which leads to an easing of the sense of separation\|Cultivating love and compassion eases the view of self, which leads to an easing of the sense of separation]]<br/><hr class="cell">Through the practice, the walls of the self can begin to soften. In a way, we could say self and ego and all that is built by a kind of problematic self-view, a view of struggling with oneself, in a way. And to cultivate love and compassion is actually easing the view of self. And in that there is an easing of the sense of separation. So there's oneness, and also as we've touched on over the weeks, the possibilities of getting a sense or glimpses of this anattā, this emptiness of self, through the practice, just through the practice of love and compassion. |
|  | <span class="blockid">3-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#So far metta was directed to beings\|So far, metta was directed to beings]]<br/><hr class="cell">Okay, that's a sort of brief bus tour, like I said, of the show so far. This morning we began something different. So everything so far, the first two weeks, has been loving-kindness and compassion towards _beings_, which is of course how we tend to conceive of it: loving-kindness towards self, loving-kindness towards others and all beings. And extending the mettā in that very boundless and universal way. |
| <span class="blockid">3-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Story Programme of Combridge Insight Meditation Center\|Story: Programme of Combridge Insight Meditation Center]]<br/><hr class="cell">Okay, so far, so good, I hope! All _that_ is in the realm of what we could call traditionally understood practices of loving-kindness and compassion. I remember, quite some years ago - I don't remember when it was - I lived in America, and nearby was an urban non-residential meditation centre, Cambridge Insight Meditation Center. And about twice a year, they would publish their programme of speakers and weekend retreats and day retreats, and this and that, and courses. And for a period of about, I don't know, five years at least, every time it would come out, twice a year, it would have a nice picture of the Buddha on the front and a quote. And for about five years, the quote was from the _Lotus Sūtra_, one of the very influential Mahāyāna _sūtras_. And it said: | <span class="blockid">3-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#"Seeing all things with compassion"\|"Seeing all things with compassion"]]<br/><hr class="cell">I remember when I was living in America, and there was an urban centre there. I think twice a year they would publish their brochure, programme. And it would have the list of retreats and all that stuff in it. And for about five years or something, every time, every edition that came out had on the front of it this nice picture of a Buddha statue smiling or something, and this quote from the Lotus Sutra, which is one of the very well-known and well-loved Mahāyāna sūtras. And this quote said, "See all things with the eyes of compassion," or "See all things through the eyes of compassion." And so for five years I saw that on the front and said, "Very nice, okay," and went and saw who were the teachers that were coming, what retreats can I do, etc. And at some point, it dawned on me, "Well, actually it doesn't say, 'See all _beings_ with compassion.' It says 'See all _things_ with compassion,' which is a different thing." So we begin to wonder, what does that mean? Does it mean regard the alarm clock with compassion? What does it mean? |
| <span class="blockid">4-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#"See all things with the eyes of compassion" Lotus Sutra\|"See all things with the eyes of compassion" (Lotus Sutra)]]<br/><hr class="cell">> See all things with the eyes of compassion [or see all things through the eyes of compassion].^[This quotation does not appear in the _Lotus Sūtra_, though the text does include a description of _Avalokiteśvara_ as _sarvasattvakṛpamaitralocano_: "having eyes of loving-kindness for all wretched beings." Also see the translation from Chinese at Tsugunari Kubo and Akira Yuyama, tr., _The Lotus Sutra_ (Berkeley: Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research, rev. 2nd edn 2007), 302, https://www.bdk.or.jp/document/dgtl-dl/dBET_T0262_LotusSutra_2007.pdf: "The pure seer Avalokiteśvara ...

And usually I would just get the programme, and you know, "Who's coming? Yeah, very nice, okay. Which courses do I want to do?" And it took a while, but then at some point I just noticed, "Hold on. It doesn't say, 'See all _beings_ with the eyes of compassion.' It says, 'See all _things_ with the eyes of compassion.'" What could that mean? Does it mean to regard the microphone with compassion? The poor microphone has to sit here and listen to me drone on and on. [laughter] Is that what it means? |  |
| <span class="blockid">4-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Aksayamati Sutra\|Aksayamati Sutra]]<br/><hr class="cell">There's another Mahāyāna _sūtra._ It's called the _Akṣayamati Sūtra_.

And again, this is quite difficult to understand, but we think, "What does it mean?" |
|  | <span class="blockid">3-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#Recap guided meditation - Metta to phenomena\|Recap guided meditation - Metta to phenomena]]<br/><hr class="cell">In a way, we began this this morning: directing the mettā, directing the compassion, towards experience, towards objects of experience, rather than beings. And just to review - we did the guided meditation this morning, but just to review. Whatever way of working with that is helpful to you, is fine. So it could be something's happening in the body or the heart or the mind or whatever, and there's a sense of bathing it, bathing it in love and compassion, directing the flow, the current of love and compassion towards that. May be more helpful to kind of feel or envisage a kind of _holding_ of the experience, of the object, in the mettā, in love or compassion. |
| <span class="blockid">4-8</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#In the Mahayana traditions "compassion" includes loving-kindness\|In the Mahayana traditions, "compassion" includes loving-kindness]]<br/><hr class="cell">So a couple of words, translations: first of all, 'compassion' and 'love,' in a lot of the Mahāyāna traditions, they use it interchangeably. Or rather, they more often use the word 'compassion' to mean both what we're talking about - compassion - and loving-kindness. Here they've done the same thing but with 'love.' Less rigidly different, the terms. So both of those statements, the _Lotus Sūtra_, "See all _things_ with the eyes of compassion" - it means with kindness and compassion. | <span class="blockid">3-7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#Emphasis was on complete acceptance\|Emphasis was on complete acceptance]]<br/><hr class="cell">Should also say at this point, in a lot of the Mahāyāna teachings, they dispense at one level with the words 'love' and 'compassion.' They just use one word, 'compassion,' to mean mettā and compassion. So this morning in the guided meditation, I was actually going back and forth between using those words, and just to - not to confuse anyone. And you can use the phrases if that's helpful, you know. Again, we can go into this sense of consciousness, just awareness, the space of awareness just being a very open door. And there's _complete_ welcoming, _complete_ acceptance. So what's being emphasized here is the love, the acceptance. Absolute, radical acceptance. Not, as in a usual vipassanā practice or awareness practice, the precision, the clarity: "What exactly is going on? Can I see it moment to moment to moment?" |
| <span class="blockid">4-9</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#"Dharmas" here mean things in experience i e objects of awareness\|"Dharmas" here mean things in experience, i.e. objects of awareness]]<br/><hr class="cell">And what is a _dharma_? What does this mean - "love is based on _dharmas_, directed to _dharmas_"? A _dharma_ has a lot of different meanings in the teachings. And one of them just kind of means 'things.' It just means 'things,' but it means 'things' as experiences or objects of awareness. So some _thing_ arising in awareness is a _dharma_. So whatever that is - a body sensation, a thought, an intention, a mood, a mind state, a moment of _samādhi_, whatever it is, compassion - they're all _dharmas_. So it's just a thing in awareness, a thing as an experience. |  |
| <span class="blockid">4-10</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Dharmas are not things on their own\|Dharmas are not things on their own]]<br/><hr class="cell">**Yogi**: Are _dharmas_ never just things on their own? Does it always has to be related to the awareness or the experience? |  |
| <span class="blockid">5-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Recap guided meditation directing the stream of loving-kindness and compassion towards experience\|Recap guided meditation: directing the stream of loving-kindness and compassion towards experience]]<br/><hr class="cell">Now, on one level, at first, this doesn't make any sense logically, and "What on earth is it talking about?" But we saw with the guided meditation this morning, and you've been practising today. Just to review that a little bit. We can, in our practice, direct this stream, at times, when we feel a stream of loving-kindness and compassion, actually direct it towards experience, whatever the experience is, and actually bathe that experience in loving-kindness and compassion, _or_ compassion, or both, or a mixture, or whatever it is. We can _hold_ it in compassion, _hold_ it in love, or _let_ it be held in that water of love. If you're just talking about the techniques now and the ways to experiment with it, we can use the phrases or just a word in the phrases, if that feels helpful. You can experiment with this mode of opening the door of awareness, opening the door of consciousness, and totally, totally welcoming, just opening it up so it can be there. |  |
| <span class="blockid">5-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Emphasizing acceptance not so much precision and clarity\|Emphasizing acceptance, not so much precision and clarity]]<br/><hr class="cell">So emphasizing the love, emphasizing the loving-kindness and compassion, emphasizing the loving-kindness and the compassion and the _acceptance,_ and not so much emphasizing the precise clarity of noticing or noting or seeing exactly what's going on. Oftentimes, when we talk about mindfulness and we practise mindfulness, that's what gets emphasized, is the clarity of what's going on, the clarity of seeing what's going on, the precision of seeing. So it's a different approach when one's _really_ emphasizing the acceptance, which also is talked about as part of mindfulness. But really leaning towards emphasizing the acceptance aspect, the love aspect. Emphasizing a total welcoming, as long as it's genuine. One works in the practice to make it completely genuine, really, really welcoming this experience so that the arising of any experience is completely welcomed, completely held in that love. | <span class="blockid">4-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#With mindfulness practice there's both emphasis on precision and acceptence here more the welcoming of the experience\|With mindfulness practice, there's both emphasis on precision and acceptence, here: more the welcoming of the experience]]<br/><hr class="cell">If we talk about mindfulness practice, both those emphases are there - there's the emphasis on precision and acceptance; oftentimes it's the precision that we tend to emphasize. So there's a reversal of that here. I'm not so interested in the precision, but we're really interested in the flow of kindness, in the holding, in the acceptance, in the welcoming. Really emphasizing as complete as possible, a genuine welcoming of the experience, of the moment's experience of the object in consciousness, for its arising, for its staying, for its passing. |
| <span class="blockid">5-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Arising staying passing - held in love or direct that intentionality\|Arising, staying, passing - held in love, or direct that intentionality]]<br/><hr class="cell">The arising of all experiences, the staying - so an experience of phenomena, a _dharma_ stays in consciousness for a while, short or long - and it passes. And so the arising is held in love, is bathed in love, is completely welcomed. The staying and the passing - completely held and bathed in loving-kindness. So as I said, there are a few different, _slight_ different emphases of approach even within what we just said. One can work in a more _directing_ way - so this is what came up this morning - can _direct_ that stream when one feels it, _direct_ that intentionality. Or it can be much more holding and much more of a kind of relaxing into a space that's imbued or shot through with loving-kindness. Much more receptive mode. One can be directing or receptive. It's fine. | <span class="blockid">4-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#Relaxing back into a space of metta\|Relaxing back into a space of metta]]<br/><hr class="cell">And we can, as I say, we can direct the mettā, the compassion, towards the object. Or, in a way, you can kind of feel like you're relaxing back into a space, a space of mettā, a space of compassion, a space that's imbued with love. And without forcing, the objects of consciousness, whatever arises, is arising in that space. So sometimes in this practice, it will feel like, "Well, I can't feel any love. There's just a sense of resistance" or whatever. But to remember: there can be a sense that there's nowhere outside of acceptance. There's nowhere outside of love. So if we feel resistance, if we feel non-acceptance, if we feel judging, if we feel numb - whatever it is, the love, the space of love, can just be bigger, bigger than that, and see that, too, and embrace that, too, and bathe that, too, in the kindness, in the complete welcoming. And this welcoming has to be, this total welcoming has to be as genuine as possible. So as Ram Dass says, if you're trying to accept something in order that it goes away, it has a way of knowing. [laughter] It knows, he says. So just to check that out. But if there is resistance, that too. Can take a step back and that, too, is included. |
| <span class="blockid">5-7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Whatever is going on the attitude of acceptence can always just expand a little and include whatever it is\|Whatever is going on, the attitude of acceptence can always just expand a little and include whatever it is]]<br/><hr class="cell">At times, of course, what's going to come up is resistance or no feeling or whatever. But there's something about this. It's almost like, whatever's going on, the attitude of acceptance and welcoming can always just expand a little bit and include whatever it is. Any resistance, any "I hate this, I hate ... _da-da-da-da-da_," whatever it is, just expands, so - "That's okay. Welcome, welcome, welcome." So in a way, there's nothing outside the domain, outside the range, of this loving-kindness, this compassion. Nothing is outside it. Whatever's going on can actually be welcomed and included. |  |
| <span class="blockid">6-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Phenomena are fleeting by their nature so they are deserving of compassion\|Phenomena are fleeting by their nature, so they are deserving of compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">In a way, for some people, a way in is, when we look inside, and what we encounter when we look inside is just a _stream_, so to speak, or an endless cornucopia, an endless arising and passing of experience. It's just, whatever arises, it just passes. Whatever arises, it just passes. Everything is so fleeting. And so things, phenomena, _dharmas_ are fleeting by their nature, when we look at them. And in a way, you could say, they're deserving of compassion. They're impoverished. They barely last. You know? So question: what happens to feelings when we do this, when we bathe them in love, when we totally welcome, when we hold them in that? What happens to the feelings? What happens to mental states? | <span class="blockid">4-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#The fleeting nature of experience deserves our compassion\|The fleeting nature of experience deserves our compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">So at first, if you're just hearing this, it might sound a little odd, but hopefully today you've had a little bit of a sense of this practice. It can be also we are opening up to the flow of experience inside, and we're just seeing experience coming and going, and coming and going. In a way, the very fleeting nature of experience, in a way it deserves our compassion. Experience is almost nothing. It's poor. It's impoverished, in a way, and it needs our compassion. You could see it that way. |
| <span class="blockid">6-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The experiences begin to lose their edges fade dissolve\|The experiences begin to lose their edges, fade, dissolve]]<br/><hr class="cell">But anyway, what happens to feelings? What happens to mental states? What happens to body sensations? What happens to our perceptions of things? They can - and this really is a practice, so it might be clear to some people at this point. It might be less clear to others. It's really fine. This is one option in the wealth of Dharma options there are. And one may take to it, or may not take to it. It's fine. And it's a practice. It's a practice that one can develop, and that's really important to see. But it can be, as it's been said, that things, _dharmas_, experiences, phenomena, may soften. They soften. The experience of them actually softens. They begin, can begin to lose their edges. They can begin to lose their definition, to blur. Even, as Jeanette said, they can dissolve, or they can fade, either a little bit, or a lot, or completely. Did people find that generally? Even a little bit? Yeah, okay. Phew! [laughter] | <span class="blockid">4-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#Experience begin to fade\|Experience begin to fade]]<br/><hr class="cell">So a question about this practice. Maybe I can even ask you now: what happens to feelings when they're there and we really bathe them or hold them in love? What happens to mental states? What happens to emotions, to body sensations, to our perceptions of things? So this really is a practice. It's very much a practice as much as mindfulness is a practice. But you may notice and you may have noticed today - I don't know, but you may have noticed today - that there's a way that things can kind of soften. That there's an experience, there's a body sensation or an emotion, and it just begins to soften. Its edges may begin to blur, begin to dissolve a little bit. It loses its definition. It may even begin to fade somewhat. Did anyone notice anything like that at all today? Okay, some people. Good. [laughter] Phew! Otherwise we'd be straight back into [inaudible]. |
| <span class="blockid">6-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The Buddha didn't teach insight meditation but well-being and investigation\|The Buddha didn't teach insight meditation, but well-being and investigation]]<br/><hr class="cell">So, it may be, particularly for someone - well, no. It just may be that we hear this or come across this and think, "Well, hold on here. Let's just hold on a minute. That can't be right. That can't be proper _vipassanā_ meditation. That can't be proper insight meditation." But remember, the Buddha didn't teach insight meditation. And what I said at the beginning - what he taught much more is this wholesome nourishment, wholesome developing of what's beautiful, and the well-being that that provides, and the _well_ of well-being that that provides_, and_ investigation. It's not that he taught a particular technique or you have to do this or that. It's those two together that were taught. | <span class="blockid">4-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#The practice is not about being in the present moment but rather feeding what's beautiful and investigation\|The practice is not about being in the present moment, but rather feeding what's beautiful and investigation]]<br/><hr class="cell">Okay, what's going on here? What is going on here? This is very curious. This is a very curious phenomenon. We could say, "What has this got to do with - I thought Buddhist practice and mindfulness and vipassanā, I thought all that was about being with things as they are, and being in the moment, and being with what is and all that. And here I am doing this practice, and everything is kind of fading or dissolving or losing its definition. That can't be right!" So again, to go back to something I said before, what practice is about is actually not about being with what is. It's not about being with things as they are or being in the present moment. That's not what it's about. It's about - what the Buddha keeps emphasizing - this balance of wholesome nourishment, feeding what's beautiful, wholesome abiding, and investigation. The investigation, investigating into what brings freedom - which may, at times, take the form of "I'm just being with what is, what seems there in the moment." That's one avenue. But that can never be the main point of practice. The main point of practice is moving towards freedom, which is actually something different. |
| <span class="blockid">6-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The route doesn't matter the freedom matters\|The route doesn't matter, the freedom matters]]<br/><hr class="cell">And out of that, out of the wholesome nourishment, the deepening of this inner reservoir of well-being, gradually, slowly over time - _that_, together with the investigation, in whatever form the investigation takes, brings a freedom. That's what he cared about, and that's what we should care about, is the freedom. The actual route to the freedom, whether it fits in the neat confines of our image of some technique or not, that's totally irrelevant. The route doesn't matter, the freedom matters. And the principle is almost always the same for the Buddha: wholesome nourishment, investigation. And of course, in a life of practice, one has different approaches at different times. Of course one does. And straightforward, what we normally understand by _vipassanā_ practice - beautiful, beautiful practice, very powerful, very valid at times. | <span class="blockid">5-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#How we approach freedom doesn't matter - different approaches at different times\|How we approach freedom doesn't matter - different approaches at different times]]<br/><hr class="cell">How we move to that freedom, whether it's through mindfulness or vipassanā or samādhi or mettā, it's actually completely irrelevant and it doesn't matter at all. Different approaches, different times. Some people lean towards one or the other, but maybe one could say that knowing all approaches actually gives a fuller understanding, I don't know. But certainly different approaches at different times. |
| <span class="blockid">7-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#In mindfulness practice the assumption is often that mindfulness is neutral - "things as they are"\|In mindfulness practice, the assumption is often that mindfulness is neutral - "things as they are"]]<br/><hr class="cell">But let's explore this a little more. In mindfulness practice, there's actually an assumption there, quite a big one and often a subconscious one, one that we're not quite fully aware of. Or maybe we're actually saying it out loud. The assumption is that mindfulness is something neutral. The assumption is that there's something called mindfulness that - this came up in a question and answer period a week or more than a week ago. The assumption is that there's something called 'mindfulness,' that what it can do is attend to things and see things in their naked actuality, something called 'mindfulness' which doesn't interfere in any way, and it's just seeing 'things as they are' - that phrase, 'things as they are,' which is a very well-worn phrase in the Dharma, 'things as they are.' And the assumption is that mindfulness, letting go of the story, letting go of my likes, dislikes, and all that, coming close to things, I'll see the bare actuality of what the thing _is_. Or I will see, be in touch with what _is_. And sometimes, even, as I say, more problematically, we can come to take as a view of the path, as a view of the goal, that the goal of the path is 'being with things as they are,' 'being with what is.' And these become very charged concepts: 'what is,' 'things as they are.' But again, that's never, never, never the goal of the path. It's a beautiful way of practising. It's a beautiful way of being - _cannot_ be the goal of the path. The goal of the path is an understanding, a very deep understanding, that brings freedom with it. It brings freedom. It's something gone beyond this 'what is' and these notions. I'm going to fill that out. | <span class="blockid">5-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#With insight meditation there is the assumption that mindfulness is neutral\|With insight meditation there is the assumption that mindfulness is neutral]]<br/><hr class="cell">So with mindfulness practice, that we're, I think, more familiar with - vipassanā and insight meditation - there's an assumption there, that actually teachers are to blame for, which is that mindfulness is neutral. There's something called mindfulness. There are objects in the world - sights, and sounds, and smells, and tastes, and touches, and thoughts, and emotions, and all that stuff - and then there's something called mindfulness which is there, and it sees it as it is. It sees things as they are in a way that's very neutral, very not involved, not active, not influencing. But is that really true? Is there really such a thing? So to think about outside our practice, we can see how much the mind state that we have at any time influences our perception. We have this phrase, "seeing red," when we're really angry. Completely consumed in rage, and we say "seeing red." Actually, the very language is pointing to this insight: that our whole perception is coloured through the anger. Or as I'm sure you've noticed at least a little bit at times on this retreat, sometimes there's just a feeling of mettā there, and then what kind of world do we live in, what kind of world do we inhabit? Sometimes it's so strong it's a heaven realm, it's so much changed the perception. |
| <span class="blockid">7-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Example angers colours the perception and so does metta\|Example: angers colours the perception, and so does metta]]<br/><hr class="cell">Now, let's explore this a little bit. It has to do with the nature of perception. And if we just step back and look at how perception works in our life, we have, all of us, had the experience of feeling angry in some situation. And anyone who wants to kind of grow up and mature psychologically has to admit that anger _colours_ the perception at times. And we even have a phrase in English: one is 'seeing red.' I was seeing red, or he's seeing red; she's seeing red. The very words are implying this colouring of perception. One's looking at the world, at the situation in that moment, through the lenses of anger. And the perception is correspondingly changed - of a person, of ourselves, of a situation. And (some of you may have tasted this on the retreat) other extreme: when the _mettā_ feels like it's going very well, there's a softness, there's compassion, and one walks outside. And one's just having a cup of tea or whatever it is, and the _beauty_ - one feels there's a tranquillity there. It's almost that one is in a deva realm, in a heavenly realm - you know, obviously, just a short period of time. But it's something that can arise. | <span class="blockid">5-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#But the mind is coloroud with anger metta romantic love\|But the mind is coloroud with anger, metta, romantic love]]<br/><hr class="cell">So anger colours the perception, mettā colours the perception. Sometimes when we're angry with someone else, we immediately rush to think, "I need to give mettā to this other person to sort of remedy the anger." Sometimes it's very interesting to actually give mettā to ourselves when we're angry with someone else. After all, we're probably feeling hurt, so we might need it. But it's quite interesting then, because when the mettā to ourself begins to kick in, we can actually notice: there may be a change of perception of the person, of the situation. Why? Because the mind is then coloured with mettā. So anger colours it, mettā colours it, certainly romantic love colours it. Mind always has some mind state. So with mindfulness, there's always _some_ degree of something on the range from complete unconditioned bliss of loving-kindness to rage. The mind will be somewhere along that spectrum. It _has_ to be. |
| <span class="blockid">7-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#With metta towards the difficult person or towards oneself perception softens\|With metta towards the difficult person or towards oneself, perception softens]]<br/><hr class="cell">When there's a lot of love around, how does the perception change? When there's a lot of anger around, how does the perception change? When we are angry with another - and I've probably said this at some point in the retreat - typically when we're doing _mettā_ practice, we think, "Oh, I'm angry at him or her. I should give _mettā_ to them because, you know, anger's bad, and I should kind of wish them _mettā_ instead." Can be really skilful. What happens when, instead of immediately going to give the _mettā_ to the other person that we're angry at, we give the _mettā_ towards our self? Oftentimes we need it because we're feeling hurt. But it can be a very interesting place to start. And what one may find is that the _mettā_ to oneself - things begin to soften. The mind, the heart begins to soften because one's meeting oneself with _mettā - can_ do. Things soften, the mind softens, the _eyes_ then soften, and the _perception_ softens, because perception is dependent on the state of the mind. |  |
| <span class="blockid">7-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#There is always some degree of love or aversion in the mind\|There is always some degree of love or aversion in the mind]]<br/><hr class="cell">So, we could say we have a continuum of - at one end, murderous, homicidal rage. [laughs] And on the other end, beautiful love, beautiful loving-kindness and compassion, and the softness and the openness of that. The mind is _always_ - there's always some degree of love or anger, moving towards an object or away from an object, pushing, pulling. There's always some degree of love or aversion in the mind. There's always some degree. So even with mindfulness, we tend to think, again, there's just this pure thing called 'mindfulness.' But any moment of consciousness has some degree of grasping at experience, wanting to move towards it, pushing it away, aversion, love. It always has some degree, even if it's very, very subtle. |  |

So there's a spectrum, and the mind is always somewhere on that spectrum. Which amount of love reveals the real object, reveals the way it really is? Anyone? [laughter] Who's going to say? There's always some degree there. Which amount reveals the real object? And we're noticing, in the practice, "Well, when there's a lot of mettā there, the object changes." It changes its form, its impression. What's the real object? What's this real world that we're referring to? What's this real moment, this real 'things as they are,' this real 'what is'? Is what is, what is? That's a question I want to ask. [laughter] Is what is, what is? |

Can't. Human beings - actually _consciousnesses_, slugs, sheep, human beings, all of them - believe in real objects. Now, this is where this becomes very interesting. We can say, "No, it's all relative," and everything, and that's beautiful, and insight is being born. And sometimes, though, even if we say that intellectually, we still believe at some level in real objects, internal and external. But as people have said, in a way, there is no real thing. There is no neutral point. There is no real object. There is no object independent. |  |
| <span class="blockid">8-12</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The presence of love and equanimity makes objects less prominent in consciousness\|The presence of love and equanimity makes objects less prominent in consciousness]]<br/><hr class="cell">Now, someone _could_ say, "Okay, well, if it's not mindfulness, then maybe it's that thing, equanimity. I've heard about equanimity." And the word 'equanimity' sounds, you know, _equal_ + _imity_ - whatever _imity_ is. [laughter] Somewhere in the middle, and maybe that's the neutral point, right there. But again, someone practising equanimity practice deeply would notice the same thing - that as the equanimity deepens, objects are changed. There's a change of objects. So love and equanimity - the result of their presence, the result of them being in the heart, in the mind, is that objects make less impression in consciousness. They're less prominent in consciousness. And we can see this in the practice - sitting, walking, on the cushion. Certainly, as some of you have found out, when there's a pain, what happens when we do that? What happens when we do that? When there's an emotion, what happens when we bathe it in love? | <span class="blockid">6-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#Things make less impression on consciousness when there's a lot of equanimity\|Things make less impression on consciousness when there's a lot of equanimity]]<br/><hr class="cell">So we say, "All right, maybe not mindfulness. What about that other word, 'equanimity'? I've heard about that one. That must be the thing that's right there in the middle, at the perfect point. It even sounds like it, _equa_-, equa-something." But again, a deep practice of equanimity, notice the same thing: the perception of the object begins to change. It changes with the degree of equanimity. And there's a similar kind of fading with equanimity. Things make less impression on consciousness when there's a lot of love or a lot of equanimity. So we can definitely see this on the cushion and with this practice that we're doing now. You can see it with body sensations, with painful body sensations, with emotions, with whatever, absolutely. See it on the cushion in a very clear way. Can also see it off the cushion. This applies to our life too. Some situations where they're so pressing or we just can't stop thinking about them, when there's a lot of equanimity, a lot of mettā, I barely register, barely register the situation, or the importance of it anyway. |

So there's a situation that _really_ seems important or is troubling us a lot. And when there's a lot of love, or when there's a lot of equanimity, it barely impacts. Or its importance just doesn't - it doesn't seem so crucial, so pressing. Or the actual fact of it barely imprints on consciousness. |  |
| <span class="blockid">9-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Be interested in developing the skill of easful abiding\|Be interested in developing the skill of easful abiding]]<br/><hr class="cell">There's a lot here. There's a tremendous amount here. On one level, what can be discovered here is what the Buddha might call 'skilful means for easeful abiding,' for wholesome abiding, skilful means to develop ease in life, in a situation. So this is one approach to when there's something difficult: being at ease with that. This is so important. Again, going back to the wholesome nourishment, wholesome abiding - do we know, are we developing in our life, these skills to be able to be at ease more and more? How profoundly important that is to our life, to our whole sense of the quality of life and the ease of our life. Are we skilled? Are we interested in developing that skill of easeful abiding, of having ease? Even when something difficult is going on - one has an illness or there's a difficult situation, or whatever it is - there's the possibility for ease with that. So, skilful means for ease. But also, there are insights here, and they're extremely important and profound. | <span class="blockid">6-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness# "Kindfulness" is a skilful means for ease in the moment\|..."Kindfulness" is a skilful means for ease in the moment]]<br/><hr class="cell">Okay, so, about this practice, someone last year - I actually didn't have a name for it, and someone last year coined the name 'kindfulness,' which is quite nice. [laughter] It might be a little too cute for you; I don't know. It's a shorthand anyway. So what about it? A couple of things. One thing is it's skilful means. It's a real skilful means for ease, for ease in the present. And the Buddha was hugely interested in this, for people to find ways of relating to the present moment, find ways of abiding, and even abiding with what is difficult, or what feels difficult, with ways that are easeful, with a sense of ease. So it's what the Buddha would call a 'skilful means' for ease in the moment. It's really important in our life, really important to cultivate this practice so that there is that skill in means, able to abide skilfully with a sense of ease. So there's that. |
| <span class="blockid">9-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Relationships with dharmas are either of love and peace or of struggle\|Relationships with dharmas are either of love and peace, or of struggle]]<br/><hr class="cell">So the first one is that it's the relationship that is important. It's the relationship with what the experience is; it's the relationship with any object that's important. Oftentimes in insight practice or Zen practice or whatever it is, we're giving attention to objects, giving attention to experience - and understandably; that's kind of what we're told to do. But sometimes we're so kind of transfixed with what's going on, with the object going on, we're giving it so much attention that we don't see what's around that attention, the relationship that we have with the object. Sometimes we don't even realize what that relationship is. Putting it very crudely, you _could_ say, relationship with objects - _dharmas_, experience, phenomena - relationships are basically either a relationship of peace or a relationship of struggle: trying to hang on, trying to get rid of, whatever. So it's either a relationship of peace or a relationship of struggle. When there's _mettā_, love and compassion, in that relationship with whatever's going on - love is peace. Love is a relationship of peace. To have that relationship of love is to have a relationship of peace, basically. | <span class="blockid">6-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#Our relationship with experience is on a spectrum between peace or struggle\|Our relationship with experience is on a spectrum between peace or struggle]]<br/><hr class="cell">But there are enormous insights here. Enormous insights. So the first one, at one level, is that it's the relationship with things, it's the relationship with experience, that is important. So oftentimes, and sometimes in mindfulness practice, sometimes we can be so much attending to the object - to the sensation or the breath or this or that or whatever - so much kind of caught up in the attention to the object that we forget, or we don't actually realize, what the relationship is. So basically - I mean, to put it very crudely - our relationship with experience is either peace or struggle, some degree of peace or some degree of struggle. Basically, that's it, in Dharma terms. We have a relationship of either peace with something or struggle. |
| <span class="blockid">9-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The suffering goes out of experience to the degree that we can soften our struggle with it\|The suffering goes out of experience to the degree that we can soften our struggle with it]]<br/><hr class="cell">And we can see. We can see that when the relationship is non-struggling with what's difficult, it's non-struggling, the suffering goes out of experience. The suffering goes out of experience to the degree that we can soften our struggle with it. To the degree that love comes into that relationship, that peace comes into that relationship, the suffering goes out of experience. This is so crucial. And again, when we struggle with something, we tend to think, "I have this problem," or "This thing going on in my life or this thing going on in my consciousness _is_ a problem." To practise this way and to see, inherently, it cannot be a problem. It cannot. In Dharma language we say it's _empty_ of problem. The problem is empty. The problem is something _we_ bring into it through our relationship with it. In itself, any experience is empty of problem. It's so important, that level of insight. So absolutely crucial. And you can - even as I say it, you get a sense of the immense kind of both potential and responsibility that gives to consciousness. Immense. That's one level, and we can go a bit deeper. | <span class="blockid">6-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#A thing cannot be experienced as a problem unless I am in an unskilful relationship to it\|A thing cannot be experienced as a problem unless I am in an unskilful relationship to it]]<br/><hr class="cell">A relationship of love, of mettā, of compassion with experience is a relationship of peace. It's a relationship of peace with what's going on. And we begin to see that when the relationship is skilful, is one of ease, the suffering goes out of the thing. So it can be what it is, it can be unpleasant, it can be difficult, whatever, but the suffering has gone out. So that's _hugely_ significant, to really, really know this, that some experience, some thing does not inherently have any problem to it. Problems are empty, we say in Dharma language, so a thing cannot be a problem, cannot be experienced as a problem unless I am in an unskilful relationship to it: I'm struggling with it, I'm pushing it, I'm pulling at it, whatever. And to see that: the thing, the experience, the object, etc., inner or outer, is not the problem, cannot be a problem by itself. It's empty of problem. Problem is empty. Huge, huge insight there. |

And so this is what we were talking about before. And people were saying, "There is no real object," etc. Earlier in the retreat, we were talking about moments, at times, that consciousness can open up into this sense of oneness or communion. Sometimes it opens up in a very vast way. Vast sense of oneness - beautiful. Beautiful for consciousness to open up to, at times. But even that is actually empty. It's still a perception that's come into being through the way we are looking, through our relationship _with_. | <span class="blockid">7-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#Even oneness is not how things really are it's also dependend on conditions\|Even oneness is not how things really are, it's also dependend on conditions]]<br/><hr class="cell">Second one, and actually even deeper, is, again, this emptiness of how things are. Even, sometimes - going back to what I said before - sometimes in the practice there are openings or there's a kind of melting going on. There's a sense of oneness. And it can feel relatively nondescript or whatever, but that's rare. Or it can feel completely mystically, cosmically mind-blowing. And again, anywhere on that scale. There's a sense of oneness. But actually, what this insight into emptiness is saying is that even oneness is not how things are. That's a perception. If you remember that note that I read out from the work retreatant about a sort of sense of dark, infinite space of love that was kind of holding everything and accommodating everything that she opened up to - even that sense, beautiful, cosmic sense of infinite, eternal love that's, whatever you want to say, woven into the fabric of the universe - that arises when the conditions are there. When the conditions are not there, it won't be there. Same with the oneness. |

It's born out of conditions, held together by conditions, held together by the way we're viewing and the relationship _with_. |  |

They're not separate. They're not one. They're not however. But I feel it's really, really important to say here: sometimes, often I think, what we hear in teachings is, "Don't get attached to a sense of oneness. Don't get attached to that sense of vast love holding everything, if that opens up, because that's just a perception. It just arises from conditions." And then we say, "Okay, I'll let go of that, whatever." Don't be in a hurry. If this is part of the experience, really not to be in a hurry to let go of that kind of thing. The power of those kind of perceptions to transform the heart and transform the mind over time is enormous, absolutely enormous. And if we hurry through, and just say, "Oh, just a perception. It's just conditions, just a fabrication," where do we go? We actually just go straight back to the default perception, which is "I'm sitting here giving a talk, and you're trying to stay awake" or whatever it is. [laughter] That's the default. Human consciousness is programmed incredibly strongly to go to that default mode. What we begin to see in practice is that default way of seeing is not the reality. If we throw out what I would call the deeper senses of oneness, of an infinite love, whatever you want to call it, if we throw that out too quickly, we just go back to the default, and in a way, we're not challenging that default mode enough. |

And it's funny. Sometimes I wonder - it's not a line that often seems to get extracted much. But if you read the _Mettā Sutta_, and if you just read it with an open mind, it basically describes _mettā_ and the beauty of all that and what one should do, and then says, "This leads to awakening." And what it says here is, it goes through the _mettā_ and says, "This is said to be the sublime abiding." Then it says, "By not holding to fixed views, the pure-hearted one," etc., "gets enlightened."^[SN 1:8] By not holding to fixed views - of how things are, how I am, how an object is, how the world is. By not holding to fixed views - that's where this is going. That's the piece. That's the hinge pin. | <span class="blockid">7-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness# "By not holding to fixed views" - the liberation comes through how ways of seeing are fabricated\|..."By not holding to fixed views" - the liberation comes through how ways of seeing are fabricated]]<br/><hr class="cell">So there's a line. I don't know; it's curious. I'm not sure how many people even notice this - maybe people do, but - this is the Mettā Sutta, and towards the end, it basically is a description of how mettā leads to complete awakening. And so, in the very last paragraph, "By not holding to fixed views," etc., "reaches enlightenment."^[SN 1:8] [laughter] But that line, "By not holding to fixed views," not holding to the fixed view of separation, the default everyday view, our normal view, which six and a half billion people agree to. Not holding to that view. Not also holding to the view of oneness. Not holding to the view of infinite space of love. And there are other views too. This is the power of mettā practice, that one goes in and out - at a very deep level, if one gives months and months and months to this practice - one _will_ go in and out of various states of consciousness, and then one just says, "Well, which one is real?" "By not holding to fixed views" - the liberation comes through understanding something about how perceptions, views, ways of seeing, are fabricated. |

The truth of them, in a way, is not that they exist, really, or that they don't exist. They exist dependent on our relationship _with_. So in this teaching of emptiness, it's called 'the Middle Way': a middle between saying things exist and saying they don't exist. It's called 'the Middle Way,' neither existing - and it's not sort of, "Well, they exist kind of half of the time," or something like that. [laughs] It's something that's beyond those. To say things don't exist is clearly not true. But to see that they don't exist in any way independently from the way I am looking, independently from the relationship with. So when it says they don't exist, it means they don't exist independently, inherently. Or as the Tibetans say, they don't exist 'from their own side.' | <span class="blockid">7-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#The Middle Way points to neither existence nor non-existence nor some kind of compromise\|The Middle Way points to neither existence, nor non-existence, nor some kind of compromise]]<br/><hr class="cell">So truth, in a way, all we can say is that the truth of things is that they're empty. To say they exist is a little - you know, when we begin practising this way, it's actually a little bit problematic. To say they don't exist at all is also problematic. So the truth of emptiness is actually something - it's called the Middle Way, meaning it's not existence and it's not non-existence, and nor is it some kind of compromise ("Well, they sort of, half the time they …" whatever). It's something that's a different kind of level: neither existence nor non-existence. |

For example, take a situation like a meditation retreat. And one comes, and one comes on _this_ retreat. Come to Gaia House, three weeks of retreat, and you think, "Great! I'm really going to work on my _samādhi_ and get really quiet and calm," and then one comes into the hall, and it's pretty packed in here, and someone's shuffling next to you or coughing or whatever it is, and irritation arises. And the whole view of the situation, of that person, is seen through the lens of irritation. We've come into the situation with the agenda of 'what I want,' and that's colouring everything. And then the view, the perception, changes. | <span class="blockid">8-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#Example "What I want" colouring the meditation practice\|Example: "What I want" colouring the meditation practice]]<br/><hr class="cell">We can see it in our practice, and we can see it on all kinds of levels. So we can also see it outside our practice. Or one might come to a situation like this, and here we are. You think, "Three weeks at Gaia House, right. I'm really going to get my samādhi together. I'm going to really quieten the mind" or whatever. And then one comes, and someone's fidgeting next to you or whatever, or coughing or whatever it is, and you say, "How am I supposed to …?!" You know, I've arrived at the meditation centre with this view - again, I've said it in another talk - of _what I want_. And then that begins to colour everything. We view the situation through _what I want_. So we can play with this. What happens if I come into the meditation hall, and here are all these, you know, irritating people again [laughs], or one particular person, and one says, "This person is giving me the opportunity to practise patience, to practise kindness," whatever? And see if one can actually genuinely make that shift, and see the situation differently. And then it's a gift, their presence and whatever it is they're doing. |
| <span class="blockid">11-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Play with different perceptions of the situation\|Play with different perceptions of the situation]]<br/><hr class="cell">We can play with this. The beauty of practice is that you can play with all this and experiment with it. Could I change that view in a situation like this or some other retreat? And this person is restless, or whatever it is - could I view that situation, then, as an opportunity to learn patience? Then every time there's some disturbance, it's an opportunity to learn patience. And the whole view has changed. Or if you're super advanced, Vajrayāna ... [laughs] You sit there and forget the _samādhi_, forget everything: "My whole purpose of being here is to love you, just you." [laughs] Play with it. What happens? The view changes and the perception changes. The perception we have of things is dependent on the view, of how we're seeing. | <span class="blockid">8-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#Changing the perception can make the irritability go away from the situation\|Changing the perception can make the irritability go away from the situation]]<br/><hr class="cell">And if you're kind of really adventurous and bold, you can come in and sit down and have a view, "Actually, I'm not here for samādhi. All I'm here to do is to love you. That's all. I'm just here to love you." That's very advanced practice! [laughter] So what we notice is, if we change the view, the perception changes. The irritability goes from the situation. How we see the situation and how we see a person depends on what the mind is bringing to it - mettā, compassion, irritability, what I want, whatever it is. And the mind's always bringing something. |
| <span class="blockid">11-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#With fear the object and the fear are not independent\|With fear, the object and the fear are not independent]]<br/><hr class="cell">So I was speaking about fear some talks ago, and can draw this into that area as well. And fear is a very interesting one because it can be quite clear with fear. We tend to think, we tend to feel, we tend to believe that there's some thing or event going on or about to go on or will go on in the future, and then I have fear about that. I'm afraid of that. And somehow in there is the assumption that the thing and the event and the situation and the fear are separate, they're separate, and that they're independent. There's, again, an object, any object, and there's how I might relate to it. And I could relate with fear or with equanimity or whatever it is, but the object is still the object no matter how I relate to it. And begin to get the sense that that's not really the case. Now, with fear, to a degree, at least intellectually, it's obvious. We can see how fear colours our perception. You know, you're afraid walking at night in the dark, and you see the shadows, and it looks like, you know, a big ... [laughter] And it's not. It's just the shadows coloured with the perception from the fear. | <span class="blockid">8-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#Fear is not existing independently but also dependend on the reaction to it\|Fear is not existing independently, but also dependend on the reaction to it]]<br/><hr class="cell">Okay, we're going to look at this from a different angle. To go back to - I was talking about last week or whenever it was - about fear. When there's fear in the mind, we tend to think, "Here's a thing, an event, or a situation that I'm fearful of. And there's the thing and the event, and then there's my fear." And we tend to view them as separate: the thing, the event, the situation, and the fear. They're separate. Independent, existing independent. And we can see that in any way - there's any kind of object, and the reaction to it. But we can really see - fear's good because it's quite clear, like anger - the fear colours our perception of the object. So we begin to see, you know, an ogre in the shadows when there's nothing there. There's nothing. In a way, that's obvious: fear colours the perception of the object. But we also need reminding of that. |

We're often afraid of something in the future, and the thinking around it is something in the future. Even if it's next few seconds or a long time in the future, whatever, it's future-thinking based. If I believe in 'the present,' if I believe in a present moment, a present situation, as something that has real, independent existence - if I believe in the present, then fear of the future is inevitable. It's just waiting to happen. And to use the Buddha's analogy, "as sure as the wheels of the cart follow the ox that pulls it," if I believe in the inherent existence of the present, fear of the future will come.^[Dhp 1] There will be fear of the future. But we can see, through these practices and others, that the present lacks inherent existence. It's not independent.

If I believe in the present being something real, independent of the mind, there will be fear of the future, because I'm believing in a present. |

[laughter] Or you know, if I think back to my education, my school, my high school, and sometimes I think back, and it was a very pressured environment academically, and a lot of cruelty - I went to boys' school - a lot of, yeah, cruelty. And sometimes I look back in another mood, and I think, "Yeah, we really had a laugh. That was really fun. That was really ..." You know. The present is not independent; the past is also not independent. They depend on the mind state in the present. The future is the same. The future is the same. The future is only going to become present and past. It's dependent. It's not independent. It's empty. When I begin to see this, it's like, I don't really believe in the present; you can't really believe in the future. And if you can't really believe in the future, fear has no footing.

She was a really special one." [laughter] And other times, you look back and you think, "_Pfff,_" y_ou_ know. Or on our education. If I think back on my time in school, sometimes it seems, "God, that was really pressured and there was a lot of cruelty around." And other times, "God, I really had a laugh, you know." Or whatever. The past is coloured by the present mind state. What's the real past? What's the independently existing past? Present is empty. Past is empty. Future is the same. Apart from not actually _existing_ - where is it? - when it becomes present, it will become present, and it will be empty.

It's not even love towards all beings or all things; it's actually without an object. And again, the mind can just be, like, baffled by that.

So this is now what we're doing. "For those who have seen into emptiness, love is not based on anything." I just want to touch very briefly on this. This appears in other texts and traditions. So Rumi, the Sufi mystical poet, has a poem. I can't remember the poem. "Love without an object," and something he says, "is the best kind of love." And in the Tibetan traditions, the Tibetan Mahāyāna traditions and the Vajrayāna traditions, talk about “compassion without any object of reference.” And they talk about this being the very best of all paths, without any danger points. No danger of being disconnected and indifferent towards beings or anything like that. |
| <span class="blockid">12-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Compassion without any object of reference that's the best of all paths\|Compassion without any object of reference, that's the best of all paths]]<br/><hr class="cell">In some of the Tibetan traditions, in the Vajrayāna, they also talk about compassion without any object of reference - same thing - compassion without any object of reference. And it's also said that that's the best of all paths, without any potential pitfalls in it. So just to mention that as a possibility, as something ... oftentimes coming - when one goes deep into emptiness, or there's that kind of opening, one can begin sometimes to get a glimpse of this. |  |
| <span class="blockid">12-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Where are those teachings landing with you\|Where are those teachings landing with you?]]<br/><hr class="cell">In a way, actually, I want to just drop something in here which I may have said before, but I think it's pertinent. I think it's important, when one's listening to teachings and such, to notice one's reaction to what's being said. So often I was talking about this love without an object and very sort of deep teachings or high teachings or whatever. And just interesting to notice what goes on for us when we hear that. There's a whole range of reactions that are possible. Some people hear something like that - and I see this quite a lot - and just turn off, just turn off. Something just shuts down - can't hear it, don't want to hear it. Or you know, I see people picking at their nails and stuff. [laughter] Something goes on - don't want to know, can't handle it. Or we may get _really_ excited. And there's a beauty of that; there's a beauty of Dharma excitement. But sometimes we get so excited that we think, "Where I am now is completely irrelevant and not worth anything. _That's_ where I want to go." Or a kind of intense striving can come into practice. I think it's just important to see where this is landing in the moment, in oneself. And just to notice that. And of course, it can land in a very lovely place of just simple aspiration. But there's a range there, and it differs at different times, and just to see. | <span class="blockid">9-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#Do we close down when we feel something is beyond us\|(Do we close down when we feel something is beyond us?)]]<br/><hr class="cell">And so I just want, very briefly - what does this mean, love without an object? So it's actually gone beyond the sense even of love to all things, to all beings, to all objects. It's actually something on a whole different level. And it comes, glimpses of it come or whatever, when there's very deep opening to emptiness. Or can come then. But I just wanted to mention that as a possibility, and just to drop in - I think maybe it's too late now on the retreat, but it's sometimes interesting, I think, to notice the reaction when someone is talking or you read or whatever and it seems, "Oh, I'm really not there yet. I don't know what that is. That's way beyond me." Just to notice the reaction. Do we close down? Do we turn off? Do we immediately grasp at that and decide, "Well, my experiences I'm not interested in at all. I want _that_"? Or do we think, "Oh, I'm a complete failure"? Just to notice what goes on. |
| <span class="blockid">13-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Tanha vs chanda\|Tanha vs chanda]]<br/><hr class="cell">The Buddha talked about two movements of mind, two energies: _taṇhā_, which literally translates as 'thirst' - this never ... unfulfillable, endless wanting, wanting, wanting, craving. And another energy called _chanda_, which - they're both kind of 'desire.' You could translate them both as 'desire.' But _chanda_ is more 'aspiration,' 'will to do.' It's actually the fuel for our practice. And where do teachings land? Does _taṇhā_ grab hold of them and make a problem out of it? Or does _chanda_? Do they land in _chanda_? And so, there is really a place for healthy, noble, beautiful aspiration in our practice. And we can hear stuff, and it lands in a good place. I think it just needs some awareness, just to notice what goes on. And I don't know where it's from, but the image of walking, wanting to climb a mountain. And there's the mountain in the distance, and one wants to get to the mountain peak, and one has one's vision set on that, but also just the footstep in front of one. And one holds both. And there's a sensitive balance there that's important. | <span class="blockid">9-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#Chanda noble aspiration\|Chanda = noble aspiration]]<br/><hr class="cell">So the Buddha talks about taṇhā, craving that leads to suffering; grasping at things in a way that leads to suffering. And _chanda_, which is more like 'aspiration' or 'will to do': "That's something beautiful. I would like to know that. I would like to understand that. I would like to open to that." And so to have a healthy and noble aspiration - and I think going back to the opening talk, I was talking about that - really important. Really lovely thing. So, you know, the analogy of, there's the mountain, and there's the peak of the mountain, and that's where we're headed, but the step is right here, right now. And we can see where we're going, and pay attention to where we are right now. And it's both. It's finding a sensitive balance of that. |
| <span class="blockid">13-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#In its depth the nature of love is non-grasping\|In its depth, the nature of love is non-grasping]]<br/><hr class="cell">Okay. So this fading, this fading. I want to say more about that. So things can dissolve to some degree, or completely, or fade to some degree, or completely, when we do this, when we let go of - or when we hold them in love. Why? What's going on there? Why is that? Love - love or compassion, whatever word - love, like equanimity, it shares something with equanimity. We can talk about a kind of continuum of love or deepening of love, but in its depths, in the depths of love, it shares something with the quality of equanimity. And that is, in its depth, it's non-grasping. So it's very different then from the typical Hollywood scenario of love; we've moved quite a way since that. And in its depths, the nature of love is non-grasping. Like equanimity, it's non-grasping. And we see - again to reiterate, there are a couple of things here. We see that - John talked about dependent origination, so he probably talked about that link between clinging and craving and then the suffering that comes out of that. And that's one link. Did he talk about this? That's one link that's very available to our scrutiny and experimentation. We can actually learn to relax the grasping and see the suffering go out. It doesn't feed suffering. Equanimity and love, in their depths, are non-grasping - there isn't a pushing away or a pulling towards. Non-grasping. | <span class="blockid">9-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#When there's no clinging and grasping wee feel the suffering go out of experience\|When there's no clinging and grasping, wee feel the suffering go out of experience]]<br/><hr class="cell">Okay, so what about this business of fading? Sometimes we bathe something in love or hold it in love, or there's really a lot of love there, and then the object begins to fade. What is going on here? Why is that? We can begin to see maybe, or get a sense, that love, in a way, has a whole range to it. And in its depths, love, in a way, like equanimity, is non-grasping. It has the quality of non-clinging, non-grasping. So again, the first level of insight, when there's no clinging, non-grasping - and I think this probably goes back to what John was saying about dependent origination - the clinging, the craving, when that's there, the suffering comes, and we can look at that link in the dependent arising, relax the clinging, relax the craving, relax the grasping. and we feel the suffering go out of experience. Really important link in dependent arising. |
| <span class="blockid">13-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Grasping makes the way things and the world appear\|Grasping makes the way things and the world appear]]<br/><hr class="cell">But we can go a little bit deeper with the dependent origination. Grasping _makes_ the way things appear; it is something that _makes_ the way things appear. Also, grasping makes things appear. Grasping makes the world appear. So this is completely counterintuitive. Grasping makes the world appear. We tend to think, "The world is _there_. Objects are _there_." Grasping makes the world appear. | <span class="blockid">10-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#Grasping makes the way the world appears\|Grasping makes the way the world appears]]<br/><hr class="cell">But the understanding of dependent arising is something that goes really, really deep. I mean, it's an extremely profound teaching. And there's, again, a whole other level. What we begin to see is that grasping makes the way the world appears. It makes the way things appear. On an even deeper level, and this is completely counterintuitive, grasping somehow _makes_ the world appear at all. |
| <span class="blockid">13-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The less grasping the less appears at all\|The less grasping, the less appears at all]]<br/><hr class="cell">**Rob**: [laughs] I think ... Well, first of all, to see it in one's experience, that with this kind of practice, when one's emphasizing this approach, the more welcoming there is, basically the less aversion, the less pushing away and pulling towards (we say "less pushing and pulling"; that's less grasping), and what we notice is that the world, the world of experience, appears less. And if there's really very little grasping, it can be that very little appears at all. It just kind of dissolves, dissolves, dissolves. So it's really to see that. And to conclude from that, there's something about grasping that's actually building experience. I don't know that one can explain it any more than that. | <span class="blockid">10-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#The appearance of something depends on the grasping\|The appearance of something depends on the grasping]]<br/><hr class="cell">So when we're practising mettā at a very deep level towards objects, there's this non-grasping, and there's a fading, because objects, for their existence, need to be grasped at. They need to have some kind of tussle going on with them, either for or against or whatever. So this is completely counterintuitive. We tend to think, "Well, of course an object exists. It doesn't need me to do anything to it." But we begin to see: the appearance of something depends on the grasping. So there is no _thing_, there is no _real thing_ that is independent of grasping, of clinging, of what the mind is doing with it. No thing, no problem. If a thing isn't real, it can't be a real problem. |
| <span class="blockid">14-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#I can't grasp without anything to grasp at\|I can't grasp without anything to grasp at]]<br/><hr class="cell">**Rob**: But the seeing of it is absolutely crucial. I mean, if we talk about - what does it mean? What does liberation mean? There's no liberation without seeing that. And then if you really want to turn your consciousness inside out, grasping builds experience. What builds grasping? Experience. I can't grasp without anything to grasp at. Dependent co-origination - the mind cannot get around this. It cannot put it into nice, neat little packets: "There's _this,_ and then there's _this_, and then there's _this_, and this is different. First comes this, and ..." |  |
| <span class="blockid">14-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Dependent origination is a conceptual framework which dissolves itself\|Dependent origination is a conceptual framework which dissolves itself]]<br/><hr class="cell">So dependent origination is a map, a conceptual map that eats [itself], like a snake eating its own tail, a conceptual framework that leads to the dissolving of conceptual frameworks. It's pretty far out. [laughter] Not easy to understand, so I really know that I'm not talking about stuff that's easy to understand. But we _can_ begin to see this. This is the amazing thing: we _can_ begin to see this. And when one sees it, the more one sees it, the implications are totally radical. It turns our basic intuitions about life and experience inside out, upside down, on their head. That's how radical the Dharma is. And begin to see, there is no _thing_. There is no thing independent, independently existing, no separate thing. No thing, no problem! The problems that I make in life are dependent on me relating to things as separate things. |  |
| <span class="blockid">14-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#When there's grasping we are blurring our vision\|When there's grasping we are blurring our vision]]<br/><hr class="cell">So we also see that as we let go of grasping, we notice that grasping is also a factor which clouds our seeing. When there's grasping, we're blurring our vision. We're covering up our vision. We're distorting our vision through that grasping. So, love and non-grasping also lead, bring with them, a seeing more deeply, more clearly. In Dharma terms, what does it mean to see more deeply and more clearly? It means to see things like impermanence and this very emptiness, to see that more clearly. That's what it means. And out of that seeing more clearly comes freedom and actually comes even more love. And the whole thing builds freedom, and builds - or rather, it opens freedom. It allows freedom and love. | <span class="blockid">10-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#Grasping clouds our seeing\|Grasping clouds our seeing]]<br/><hr class="cell">In the depths of love, there is this non-grasping. And we can also see, you know, grasping clouds our seeing. And this is very clear in ourselves and in others. When there's a lot of grasping, we actually don't see clearly. So when there is love and non-grasping, we're actually seeing more clearly, and in the depths what it means to see more clearly is to see more impermanence, more emptiness. |
| <span class="blockid">14-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Emptiness practice should lead to love and compassion\|Emptiness practice should lead to love and compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">Now, it _can_ be that hearing about emptiness, when we first hear about it, it sounds very nihilistic, very destructive teaching, very scary often, teaching. But if our practice of it and contemplation of emptiness is not leading to love and compassion, is not opening love and compassion to some degree, there's something askew in how we're seeing it, in how we're practising it, in how we're viewing emptiness. So by its nature, it should lead to more of a sense of love. If it's not, we need to look again. There's something we're not quite understanding. We're just a bit off balance with it. But it leads to more love, to less of a sense of separation, less of a sense of barriers, less of a sense of fault-finding with oneself, with others, with situations, even - less self-inflating, deflating, etc. And in a way, the path of practice as it deepens is to see that - we begin to see that all things are empty. All things. So selves are empty - my self, another self. Things are empty - so-called 'inner' things, so-called 'outer' things. _Minds_ are empty - what we call 'consciousness' is actually empty, doesn't really exist as something separate, independent. Suffering, too, is empty. Suffering doesn't actually exist independently. And somehow, with all of that, in all of that, mysteriously, even though no selves, no others, no suffering, even, somehow, more love and compassion is coming out of it, in the sort of mystery of the paradox of it. | <span class="blockid">10-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#The indicator for emptiness is love and freedom\|The indicator for emptiness is love and freedom]]<br/><hr class="cell">Seeing more emptiness brings with it freedom and love. It's an inevitable outcome of seeing emptiness: freedom and love. If I think I'm seeing emptiness, but it's _not_ leading to a sense of freedom or relief or love or joy or peace or compassion, then there's something a little askew in the way we're seeing or in our understanding of emptiness. So emptiness sounds very nihilistic, a kind of depressing, dry word, but actually the indicator of it is love and freedom. Seeing emptiness leads to love and compassion, because it's kind of done away with the reality of separation, with the reality of barriers, with the reality of real problems, real faults, with the investment we have in self-inflating or self-depreciation. |
|  | <span class="blockid">10-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#Paradoxically seeing that even that suffering doesn't really exist somehow leads to even more love and compassion\|Paradoxically, seeing that even that suffering doesn't really exist, somehow leads to even more love and compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">And eventually - as I said, we're just beginning here - but eventually where the practice goes is, we begin to see it's all empty. It's all empty. And this isn't nihilistic at all. There's something very beautiful in this. So self is empty, selves are empty, things are empty, inner things, outer things (so-called). Begin to also see minds are empty. And actually suffering is empty too. All of it, all of it, all of it. And somehow, kind of mysteriously, or even paradoxically, seeing even that suffering [doesn't really exist], that beings who suffer don't really exist, somehow it leads to even more love and compassion. |
| <span class="blockid">15-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#This is possible for us\|This is possible for us]]<br/><hr class="cell">And so I want to reiterate, I'm aware that sometimes we hear this, and it just, "I don't know what this is talking about." But this is actually possible for us. This really is possible. So if not through this avenue, through other Dharma avenues. We _can_ open this up, in a very real way that begins to have a very real impact on our lives and the way we live. | <span class="blockid">10-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#It's something that we go deeper slowly gradually in a non-linear way\|It's something that we go deeper, slowly, gradually, in a non-linear way]]<br/><hr class="cell">So listening to that, you know, again, it may sound completely abstract or far removed or whatever. But this is a very real possibility, I'm talking about something very real that's possible for everyone, everyone in the room. We tend to think about awakening, or we hear about awakening, and stories, and people's accounts, and this and that, and we tend to think, you know, one day I'll be either sitting in meditation - or _not_ sitting in meditation, if that's our view, that it never happens in meditation, it only happens in supermarkets or whatever - and then there'll be this thunderbolt and that will be it. And it will just be over in a flash, and bada-bing, bada-boom, end of el problemo! [laughter] I don't know that it works that way. Maybe for a few people, I don't know. Really I think it's something that we go deeper and deeper, slowly, gradually, usually in a non-linear way, into this understanding of emptiness. And little by little, it becomes clearer and clearer, a more and more full understanding, and deeper and deeper. And it is, it is, it is a very real possibility. As a teacher, I'm just not interested in talking about anything abstract. Just, what's the point? So I'm talking about something very real, that's genuinely possible. Even if it feels right now that, you know, "I can't relate." |
| <span class="blockid">15-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The whole spectrum of love is available for us\|The whole spectrum of love is available for us]]<br/><hr class="cell">Just finally, from the _Akṣayamati Sūtra_ and from our practice, we can see that there's a _continuum_ or a _spectrum_ of love, we could say. That's not a very good word. Or _levels_ of love - even worse word. But the human consciousness moves on that continuum. It has to move on that continuum. So sometimes we do not feel love, and we're just sitting here kind of really grinding away at the phrases, planting the seeds of intention. Sometimes we even feel angry, and yet we're trying. And that very trying, even though we're feeling nothing or feeling the opposite, _is_ an expression of love - absolutely. And there's a whole spectrum right from there, all the way through love to self and other and humdrum, "I love my cat, I love whatever it is," all the through to this very exalted-sounding love without an object. And that's all there. And the human consciousness, amazingly, can move on that spectrum. It _does_ move on that spectrum. And that whole spectrum is available for us. And in a way, our very humanity is _in_ that movement. So we can't always be in the exalted realms - no way. Our very humanity is in the movement. And in a way, our very humility is in the movement. It _has_ to move. | <span class="blockid">11-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Love and Emptiness#A continuum of love\|A continuum of love]]<br/><hr class="cell">And so, just finally, when we talk about love, when we talk about the kind of scope and the range of love, we may already very clearly have a sense in our own practice that there are levels of love, we could say, or a continuum of love. And we as human beings, our consciousness, our heart, moves along that continuum. That's the nature of being human. And there's a kind of humility in that, that it _will_ move along this continuum. So sometimes we cannot find a sense of love, we cannot find any feeling there. All we can do is the very basic thing of planting the seeds of intention, planting the seeds of loving-kindness and compassion. And that intentionality is an act of love, even if there's no feeling, it feels dry as a bone, or even angry or whatever. And sometimes it goes through all the levels that I've mentioned, to love without an object. But again, it's not that we're always going to stay in one state or another. It's something about being human, the amazing range of human consciousness. It's staggering, the capacity of the range of human consciousness to move along that whole spectrum. And somehow in that, and in accepting that movement, that's where our humanity is and our humility is. |
