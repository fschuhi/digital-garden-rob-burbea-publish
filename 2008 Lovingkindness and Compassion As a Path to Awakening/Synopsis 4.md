| <span class="blockid">1-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#What does the word "compassion" mean\|What does the word "compassion" mean?]]<br/><hr class="cell">So this morning we introduced the compassion practice, and I really want to, in a way, amplify and extend some of the things I talked about this morning, and to fill that out, to broaden it, and look at what's involved in the practice of compassion, and also the question, what actually _is_ compassion? What does that word mean? |  |
| <span class="blockid">1-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion is the heart's natural response to suffering\|Compassion is the heart's natural response to suffering]]<br/><hr class="cell">So as you know, compassion is the second of the _brahmavihāras_. Loving-kindness, compassion, joy, equanimity - it's the second one. We _could_ say that compassion is the heart's natural response to suffering when not preoccupied with self, or not caught up in a negative self-view. Compassion, perhaps - one way of looking at compassion is the natural response of the heart to suffering when not preoccupied with self, or not caught up in a negative self-view - so it includes _our_ suffering. | <span class="blockid">1-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Compassion is the natural response of the heart to suffering in absense preoccupation with self\|Compassion is the natural response of the heart to suffering, in absense preoccupation with self]]<br/><hr class="cell">Okay, so I want to talk in a bit more detail about this practice of compassion that we're doing. One possible definition for compassion might be something, _something_, like: the natural response of the heart to suffering when that heart, when the mind, when the consciousness, is not preoccupied with self, when it's not kind of contracted around self, _what I want_, including a negative self-view, "I'm terrible at all this" or whatever it is. So when that contraction around self isn't there, the natural response of the heart when it meets suffering will be this compassion. That's one possible definition. |
| <span class="blockid">1-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#It wants to alleviate the suffering\|It wants to alleviate the suffering]]<br/><hr class="cell">And compassion is that quality, that energy, that wants to alleviate the suffering that it meets. It wants to do something about it. It wants to heal it - wants to alleviate, wants to heal, wants to soothe, wants to comfort, wants to free that suffering either in ourselves or in another being, either by changing the circumstance, by comforting, by providing some understanding - in any way at all. And as I said this morning, when the stream of loving-kindness, the stream of _mettā -_ if it's running, when it meets suffering, it turns organically and very naturally into compassion. Loving-kindness meets suffering, and it will become compassion in that moment. | <span class="blockid">1-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#When metta meets suffering it transformsinto compassion\|When metta meets suffering, it transformsinto compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">So compassion differs from mettā in that it's specific to suffering. It's oriented towards suffering. It's a response towards suffering, towards dukkha. And compassion as an energy, it wants to alleviate the suffering. It wants to heal the suffering. It wants to go out and to soothe suffering. It wants to free, it wants to free suffering. We could say, when there's loving-kindness, when there's mettā, and that mettā meets suffering, it kind of transforms into compassion. |
| <span class="blockid">1-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion has many aspects to it\|Compassion has many aspects to it]]<br/><hr class="cell">So we have this word 'compassion,' and it's a great - it's a beautiful word. In a way, 'compassion,' like all these other Dharma words, is a kind of composite. There are many factors and aspects involved in it. It's great to have one word, and it's helpful to have one word, and to know what we mean when we say that. But when we start really looking at what compassion is, it has many, many aspects to it. | <span class="blockid">1-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Compassion involves different qualities e g empathy\|Compassion involves different qualities, e.g. empathy]]<br/><hr class="cell">Again, all these - mettā and compassion and equanimity - they're all just words, but the words can be really helpful pointers of what to cultivate. But in a way, compassion is a kind of composite. It involves a lot of different qualities, a lot of different aspects to it. It certainly includes what we would call empathy, or what I'm calling empathy - meaning the kind of resonance of the heart with the suffering that it touches, or we see suffering, we witness suffering in ourselves and others, and there's a kind of trembling of the heart, I think is the Buddha's words. So we see sorrow in someone, and somehow we also feel sorrow. This is, to me, a miraculous quality of the human heart - maybe some animals' as well; I don't know. The heart has a capacity to resonate, in a very beautiful way, with the sorrow that it encounters in the world. So that's a huge part of compassion. Maybe half of compassion is empathy. |
| <span class="blockid">1-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#It includes empathy and giving\|It includes empathy, and giving]]<br/><hr class="cell">Compassion includes empathy, and I'll speak about that more tonight. It includes giving, so giving is an aspect of compassion. What are we giving? And as such, compassion is something very active. Even if it's just energetically on the cushion, in the meditation, but very much in the world, it's giving something. |  |
| <span class="blockid">1-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion also includes the steadiness of equanimity and wisdom\|Compassion also includes the steadiness of equanimity, and wisdom]]<br/><hr class="cell">Compassion also includes equanimity, this steadiness of the being, steadiness of the mind and the heart. And that's actually an indispensable factor of compassion, if we want our compassion to be sustainable, to be strong, to be open, to last in the world, to be able to bear up, keep open, face up to the suffering that we encounter in this world. Compassion has wisdom in it. And this is really crucial. In a way, as both wisdom goes deeper and compassion goes deeper, they begin to really come together. But compassion as such is not blind. Compassion has in it some degree of understanding of what the causes of suffering are, and in it, a willingness and a wish to uncover the causes of suffering, at as deep a level as possible. So very much has wisdom in it. If we talk about wisdom and insight, that's what that means: we want to understand how suffering comes about, in ways that bring freedom. | <span class="blockid">1-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Compassion involves healing equanimity wisdom kindness acceptance humour listening holding opening joy\|Compassion involves healing, equanimity, wisdom, kindness, acceptance, humour, listening, holding, opening, joy]]<br/><hr class="cell">But compassion also has this very active aspect. It wants to give, as I say. It wants to heal and soothe. It wants to do something. So it involves giving. But it also involves, it needs to have equanimity in it. It needs to have wisdom in it. It has a basis of kindness. It has kindness in it. The mettā is in it. It needs to have acceptance in it. Compassion often has humour in it. You know, it's not this very heavy, dry thing. It has listening in it. Holding. It wants to hold suffering sometimes. There's a quality of opening in it. It also has a quality of joy. Joy is running through compassion. That's quite important too. |
| <span class="blockid">1-7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion has kindness in it and acceptance and listening and a quality of opening and happiness and faith\|Compassion has kindness in it, and acceptance, and listening, and a quality of opening, and happiness, and faith]]<br/><hr class="cell">Compassion of course has _mettā_ in it, has kindness in it. Compassion has acceptance in it, so that's an interesting one. Alongside the wish to alleviate suffering, it also has acceptance of the fact of suffering. Compassion can have humour in it, often _does_ have humour in it. So it's not necessarily a heavy energy; it can be very light. Compassion has listening. Listening is very much a quality of compassion. Sometimes we encounter someone, we're with someone - there's nothing we can do for their situation except listen, except open ourselves in that way. And that's compassion. When in a way one's giving the listening, although it's a kind of receiving, one's giving that, offering that. Opening - compassion has this quality of opening. Compassion actually has joy in it. Happiness is a factor of compassion. Compassion has faith in it - this is a very interesting one - has faith in it. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Like metta compassion is not just a feeling\|Like metta, compassion is not just a feeling]]<br/><hr class="cell">And like we said with the _mettā_ practice, it's not just a feeling. So sometimes we get a definite _feeling_ of compassion and that tenderness and that resonance and that warmth flowing out, that healing energy flowing out. But it's not just a feeling. It's actually much more than that. And if in our life our compassion is restricted to when we _feel_ it, that's too limited. Sometimes in our life we _don't_ feel it, but we act still. We _do_, we _act_ with compassion. We embody that intention. We cannot feel it all the time because feelings are impermanent - same as what we talked about with the _mettā_. | <span class="blockid">1-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Compassion is more than a feeling\|Compassion is more than a feeling]]<br/><hr class="cell">So compassion is all of that and probably more. And again, like mettā, it's not just a feeling. Certainly the feeling aspect of compassion is important, but it's a whole lot more. It's a whole lot more than that. |
| <span class="blockid">2-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#It's easy to see compassion as a kind of burden\|It's easy to see compassion as a kind of burden]]<br/><hr class="cell">Now, most people, if we're honest with ourselves, the relationship to compassion or the idea of compassion is ambivalent. We have a pretty ambivalent relationship to the intention of compassion. Very, very common, and very understandable and easy, to see compassion, regard it as a kind of burden. Here, somehow, am I going to be burdened with the suffering of the world? And everyone in this room is aware of the kind of magnitude and enormity of the suffering in the world. And somehow the idea of opening to that feels like a burden - despite, or alongside, our best spiritual aspirations. | <span class="blockid">1-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Many people are wary that they might be taking on more suffering through compassion\|Many people are wary that they might be taking on more suffering through compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">It's interesting, we all signed up for this retreat, loving-kindness and compassion, and yet I still feel that most human beings have a somewhat ambivalent relationship with compassion. Despite our - everyone _here_, certainly - the spiritual aspiration to cultivate compassion, to want to deepen the heart that way and open the heart that way, there's still maybe a part of us that kind of is a little bit wary and maybe a little bit scared of it. We can tend to think of it or feel it as a burden: "I've already got so much stuff going on here. Now they're asking me to open to the suffering in the world." Or, "I've got so much going on just trying to deal with my own stuff, and now I have to somehow feel burdened by the rest of humanity and beings." But I think as we grow on the spiritual path, we really see that it's not a burden. We're not opening ourselves up to _more_ suffering, actually. We're not _taking on_ more suffering through compassion. Rather, if the heart closes or remains closed to compassion, that's a burden, that's suffering. That heart will be small and dry and preoccupied with self, and there's suffering in that. There will be a burden to that. |
| <span class="blockid">2-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#We fear that compassion will overwhelm us\|We fear that compassion will overwhelm us]]<br/><hr class="cell">We aspire to be compassionate, and yet there's this ambivalence. We also feel, "Well [sighs] ... I don't know. I don't know." We feel, we fear that compassion will overwhelm us, will drown us, will make us unhappy. We _can_ fear that. When insight gets deeper, we realize that actually, lack of compassion, if our hearts are _not_ open in compassion, _that's_ actually suffering. Something about the closed-over heart, the hardened heart - that's suffering. And we could talk about, again - it's not a great word, but this word 'maturity' in practice. Part of maturity in practice is when that insight has got deep enough, that we know that it's more suffering for the heart to be closed and to live without compassion than it might be to feel overwhelmed by suffering. |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Through compassion we are reconnecting with our heart\|Through compassion we are reconnecting with our heart]]<br/><hr class="cell">So there's this ambivalence. And at the same time as this fear or trepidation we might feel, at the same time we have a real intuitive - I think most of us wouldn't be in this room if we didn't - this intuitive love and almost a yearning for compassion. It's like we sense something there. The being, the heart, senses a possibility for itself, senses a depth of possibility for itself, and beauty for itself. And a part of us yearns for that, longs for that, senses that possibility, because I think a part of us realizes that through compassion and in compassion, there's a very deep connection going on. There's a very deep _reconnection_ going on. We are reconnecting to ourselves, some very deep aspect of ourselves, of our being, of our heart. Reconnecting with our heart. Connecting and reconnecting with 'other.' Very much and very deep - the compassion practice has something very deep about that reconnecting, and we long for that. As much as we shore up our own individuality and separateness, we long for this connection that comes so powerfully through compassion practice. | <span class="blockid">2-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Compassion should be an energizing pleasant quality\|Compassion should be an energizing, pleasant quality]]<br/><hr class="cell">So there is, though - I mean, this is a human thing - we are ambivalent, often, about compassion. So we have this kind of unsureness about it, uncertainty about it, fear of it. And we also have this yearning for it. Very, very deep in the heart is a sense that this is something that really is profoundly fulfilling to the heart. The heart's moving out in compassion, opening to compassion, opening to the suffering of others is something almost without which a life cannot be fulfilled. And so deeply we yearn for it because of the connection that it sustains, that it opens with ourselves. Our own heart is deeply connected with its own depth. And the connection, of course, with others. And you may also be having a sense, you know, at times there's a real sweetness even in the compassion. It's a very sweet quality. It can be, it should be, an energizing quality, something of it that's actually sustaining, bright. It should also be - and this may or may not be the case, more or less, but - it should also be a pleasant quality. It's something that the heart can settle into, and actually enjoy compassion. Not a burden, not something to be scared of. The warmth of it, the beauty of it. |
| <span class="blockid">2-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Energizing rather tiring pleasant rather than unpleasant\|Energizing rather tiring, pleasant rather than unpleasant]]<br/><hr class="cell">Sense of sweetness, energizing We may also have a sense of the sweetness in compassion practice. So even though there's this trepidation, we can sense that there's a sweetness there for the heart, a really lovely sweetness. Compassion, too, is energizing. It's actually an energizing quality. I'm going to come back to this later. Compassion should be energizing rather than tiring. Compassion should also be pleasant rather than unpleasant. Even though we're opening ourselves to suffering, we're tuning into suffering, we're looking at it, we're willing to let the heart resonate with it - still, compassion is a pleasant quality. It's a pleasant abiding, a sublime or divine abiding. |  |
| <span class="blockid">3-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#There's lovely warmth in compassion and nobility something to be proud of\|There's lovely warmth in compassion, and nobility, something to be proud of]]<br/><hr class="cell">There's warmth in it. There's lovely warmth in compassion. And as the Buddha would say, it's something that gives the being nobility. It gives the being a very deep and beautiful, organic nobility, a natural nobility to the being. Something of which we can feel proud. When that quality is there, we can feel proud in a very healthy, non-egoistic way. | <span class="blockid">2-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#It's an ennobling quality\|It's an ennobling quality]]<br/><hr class="cell">And again, going way back to, I think, something I said in the opening talk, that compassion is an ennobling quality. It really gives a kind of beautiful nobility to the heart. And this is something which we can be genuinely proud of, our aspiration towards compassion. Perhaps on another level, too, it dissolves the kind of prison of self-interest that is our typical dwelling place. And this, again, is something that we're ambivalent about. So again, oftentimes spiritual practitioners feel the constriction of the self, and that as a prison, and yearn to be free, and yet, "Whoa! Maybe not so fast." It can be a little bit disorienting, or we're actually not sure how much we want to let go of the self-interest. |
| <span class="blockid">3-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion dissolves the prison of self-interest\|Compassion dissolves the prison of self-interest]]<br/><hr class="cell">There's also a sense - we might have this sense with compassion that the movement into the depths of compassion begins to, or _will_ begin to, dissolve the kind of prison of self-interest. So we may feel in our lives, or the more practice - as we begin to practice, we may feel how this self-interest is a prison. We're binding ourselves in it. So we have this sense, this intuitive sense, that as we go into compassion, perhaps that prison of self-interest will be a little dissolved, or a _lot_ dissolved. Now, we may be very attracted to that, but again, we may be pretty ambivalent about it. | <span class="blockid">2-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#We cannot find a really deep happiness in life if we're self-centred\|We cannot find a really deep happiness in life if we're self-centred]]<br/><hr class="cell">But through the compassion practice, it's moving that way, through the insights that come from the compassion practice and the mettā, through the kind of sense of oneness that sometimes opens up there. And slowly, over time, I really think we begin to sense that we cannot be fulfilled, we cannot actually find a really deep happiness in life if we're self-centred. From the centre of self, to go out in the world searching for happiness, is doomed to failure, is doomed to limitation, is doomed to actually create suffering. And as these practices mature, I think, I would say there comes a point for people when one just says, "Actually, you know, I'm just not interested in living a life with self at the centre any more." It's just something has either gradually or suddenly just snapped. And that kind of life with self at the centre is no longer that interesting. |
| <span class="blockid">3-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Gradually the sense of self begins to soften\|Gradually, the sense of self begins to soften]]<br/><hr class="cell">In a way, a fundamental part of the fundamental delusion, Dharmically speaking, is this belief in a separate, independent self. Somehow we're caught up in that belief, and we believe it, and we keep reinforcing it with the self-interest. And through practices like loving-kindness and compassion, and as the insight comes out of those practices, as the _samādhi_ deepens, as the heart opens, there is a sense of that self softening and opening, in a very non-linear way - very gradual, glimpses of it at first, then a bit more, etc. The sense of self begins to soften, can begin to open, and insights into the whole nature of self and other, etc., come with that - _can_ come with that. |  |
| <span class="blockid">3-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#We can't really be fully fulfilled pursuing happiness through self-centredness\|We can't really be fully fulfilled pursuing happiness through self-centredness]]<br/><hr class="cell">But alongside that is a sort of very basic insight, and it's that we begin to realize that we can't really be fully fulfilled pursuing happiness through self-centredness. It just takes time, but eventually the coin just drops. It just drops. This is the pattern we inherit. You could [say], in strict Dharma terms, we inherit if from our previous lives, this self-delusion that's caught up in a way of looking for happiness, searching for happiness, going about it through self-centredness. Something can begin to happen through insight and through compassion: that whole project, we realize, cannot fulfil us. It's backwards, and in fact, searching for happiness through self-centredness actually leads to suffering. And we can all say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know." But it takes a while, it really takes a while to digest this in a way that one's living it out. |  |
| <span class="blockid">3-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#"My religion is kindness My religion is compassion "\|"My religion is kindness. My religion is compassion."]]<br/><hr class="cell">But I would say, and I really would say this, that there can come a point with practices like these - insight and love and compassion practices - it's almost like the consciousness reaches an edge. And one can feel rising in oneself a conviction: "I'm not interested any more in living a life with self at the centre. I'm just" - that whole view and outlook of life which seems so natural, _so_ natural, it just begins to lose its compulsivity or its convincingness. And a person can really reach a point - something's like, "It just doesn't do it for me any more. I'm just not interested in that any more." Something has, you could say, broken in the heart. Something has melted in the heart. Don't want self to be the centre of the stage any more, or the centre of the life stage necessarily. As these practices go on - again, they're very non-linear, but there comes a deeper and deeper commitment to this, a deeper and deeper commitment to love and to compassion and to living less from the self, about the self, for the self. So the Dalai Lama is fond of saying, "My religion is kindness."^[Margaret Gee, _Words of Wisdom: Quotes from His Holiness the Dalai Lama_ (Kansas City: Andrew McMeel Publishing, 2001), 23] So instead of explaining all the complex Buddhist philosophy, etc., he just says, "My religion is kindness. My religion is compassion." | <span class="blockid">2-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Gradually there's a deepening commitment to love and compassion\|Gradually there's a deepening commitment to love and compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">All this happens gradually, but there's a deeper and deeper commitment to love and to compassion. And as I think John said, maybe in the opening talk, you know, the Dalai Lama, someone with tremendous years of practice and commitment says, "My religion is kindness." It's just moved to that kind of place. |
| <span class="blockid">4-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion practice has a lot of cultivation in it but also questioning\|Compassion practice has a lot of cultivation in it, but also questioning]]<br/><hr class="cell">So, like I mentioned - was it the last talk? - we need to be asking questions with this. Compassion practice has a lot of cultivation in it, but it also has a lot of questioning in it. All these practices, there's an aliveness of inquiry. And part of what we're asking is, what is compassion? What does it mean? But we're also asking this other question, or we're asking a _number_ of other questions. And it's important, it's _crucial,_ it's really crucial for a life of practice that we're asking the right questions both of ourselves, of our lives, but of our practice. Are we asking the right questions? It's so important. | <span class="blockid">2-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#How can I develop compassion\|How can I develop compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">For the Buddha, one of the really important things in his own search, in his own practice, and also what he tried to encourage others, was asking the right questions of ourselves, of life, of practice. We may think, "Okay, compassion. All right. I see it's a good idea. How does it develop in my life?" So this asking the questions. How can I develop compassion? How does the heart open more in compassion? Asking these questions - really, really important in life. |
| <span class="blockid">4-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Story Gertrude Stein on her death bed\|Story: Gertrude Stein on her death bed]]<br/><hr class="cell">I only know two things about Gertrude Stein, the writer. One of them is that when she was on her deathbed, she was surrounded by her sort of entourage of admirers. You know Gertrude Stein the writer? [laughter] She was surrounded by this entourage of admirers. She was obviously dying. She was slipping in and out of consciousness, in and out of - I don't know if it was coma or what, but in and out of consciousness, certainly. And it appeared to the people around her that she would sort of go into the 'next world,' so to speak, pass beyond, and then come back. And she kept doing that. And one of her entourage, whose name, I think, was Mildred something or other (I can't remember), because it seemed like she was passing beyond and sort of coming back - "Well, maybe she's coming back with some wisdom and knowledge that she could impart to us of greater things." And so when Gertrude sort of reappeared and had a bit of consciousness, she said, "Gertrude, what's the answer?" And Gertrude sort of opened her eyes. "Mildred, what's the question?"^[Cf. James R. Mellow, _Charmed Circle: Gertrude Stein and Company_ (New York: Praeger, 1974), 468] [laughter] | <span class="blockid">3-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Gertrude Stein "What's the question"\|Gertrude Stein: "What's the question?"]]<br/><hr class="cell">There's a story about Gertrude Stein, the writer. I know very little about her, but she was on her deathbed, in and out of a coma, and surrounded by a sort of group of acolytes - is that the word? Devotees, almost. And she seemed to sort of be slipping into this coma and entering the other realms or whatever, and then sort of coming back to this realm a little bit, in and out like this over a few days. At one point, one of her little entourage, whose name, I think, was Nancy something, said, "Gertrude, Gertrude, what's the answer?" Because it seemed like she was going to some place. So when she sort of emerged from her coma-esque state, she said, "Nancy, what's the question?"^[Cf. James R. Mellow, _Charmed Circle: Gertrude Stein and Company_ (New York: Praeger, 1974), 468.] [laughter] Which I think - well, she was an odd fish anyway. |
|  | <span class="blockid">3-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Sometimes we want answers in life but we're not asking very specific questions\|Sometimes we want answers in life, but we're not asking very specific questions]]<br/><hr class="cell">But in a way, there was some real wisdom in that, because sometimes we have the sense of wanting answers, wanting answers in life, and yet we're not asking very specific questions. If you look back on the Buddha's search, something he was extremely skilful at was asking really particular questions of himself and of others. And when he got asked questions, after his awakening, when he got asked questions that he felt actually weren't really leading anywhere, well, he wouldn't hesitate to tell the person! [laughter] If it wasn't the greatest question, maybe they should rethink their question, or sometimes he would just ignore it. |
| <span class="blockid">4-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Cultivating compassion through Tonglen or through devotion\|Cultivating compassion through Tonglen, or through devotion]]<br/><hr class="cell">And in a way, it's very much ... We're looking for answers, but are we actually clear what the right questions are? What are the right questions in life? One of the questions, a fundamental question is, how do we cultivate compassion? Not just what is it, but how do we go about it? What brings it about? It's very much a part of - we need to be actively engaged in that questioning. And so, as I mentioned this morning, there are many techniques involved, many techniques. We've chosen the phrases. It's fine. It's a good one to start with. _Tonglen_ was mentioned, this Tibetan practice of - literally it means 'giving and taking' or 'taking and giving.' Very similar - we take in the suffering, and we give out the healing, the compassion. A person might wish to tune in, in a devotional way, to the energy of a bodhisattva, Kuan Yin, the bodhisattva of compassion (Avalokiteśvara is the Sanskrit name), Jesus Christ, some being who in an archetypal way embodies compassion, and just tuning the being into those qualities, devoting oneself to that being and the qualities that being brings. | <span class="blockid">3-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Different practices for compassion\|Different practices for compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">So questioning is very important in our practice. And of course, we're dealing very much with the techniques here. And mostly the technique that we're working with is the phrases, and that's fine. That's one option. But there are many techniques. You know, if we just talk in terms of techniques, there are many techniques for compassion. There's _tonglen_, some of you will be familiar with from the Tibetan tradition. There's the taking of a bodhisattva, so Avalokiteśvara, or Kuan Yin, Tārā, Jesus, whatever it is, and just opening to that energy, and channelling that energy. Beautiful way of practising. There is the use of insight, what I talked about a little bit the other day: using the insight to just, in all kinds of different ways, to open up the compassion. But the development of compassion in our life is, of course, not just a formal thing. And we have to ask: "Okay, I'm beginning to understand the techniques. This is working for me. What else in my life, so that it can really be a deep current in our lives?" A question: "What is it that nurtures compassion? What is it that allows it to grow in the heart?" A hugely important question for our life. |
| <span class="blockid">4-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion needs to become a current in our life\|Compassion needs to become a current in our life]]<br/><hr class="cell">Insight practice itself will bring compassion. Why? Because insight is this deep questioning into, "Where does suffering come from?" And so its correlate, or its exact opposite side of the coin, will be compassion. In asking the very question - "How does suffering come about?" - in asking that very deeply, the compassion will come automatically. So one _could_ just give oneself to very deep insight practice, and compassion will definitely come. But of course, developing compassion is not something that we just do in a formal way, like it's not just something we do in formal meditation practice. It, in a way, _can_ become or _needs_ to become a current in our life. There's a current of compassion. What is it to live a life that has that beautiful, deep current of compassion running, in a way, in a very central place in the life? In a way, the life is actually running along, flowing along, carried along on that stream of compassion. |  |
| <span class="blockid">4-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Willingness to open and touch suffering nurtures compassion\|Willingness to open and touch suffering nurtures compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">So what nurtures compassion? What allows it to grow? The sort of simplest piece of it, the most fundamental piece, is a willingness to open and to touch suffering. It's a willingness to allow the heart to open, to be touched by suffering, to draw close, to keep the eyes open, to keep the being open, and touch, witness, feel suffering. That's what the Buddha calls the 'proximate condition' - actually what the _commentaries_ call the 'proximate condition' - for compassion.^[Cf. Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa, _The Path of Purification: Visuddhimagga_, tr. Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli (Onalaska, WA: Pariyatti, 1999), 310] Now, willingness to open and touch suffering - for a lot of people in the world, that's not an obvious choice. There's suffering - "See you later! I don't want to know. I want to get as far away from it as possible. I want to protect myself, protect the heart. I don't want to feel that. I don't want to be hurt. It's too much. I don't want to be bothered" - either one's own suffering or the suffering in the world. |  |
| <span class="blockid">5-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#We need reminding of it that we want to develop the willingness to be touched by suffering\|We need reminding of it, that we want to develop the willingness to be touched by suffering]]<br/><hr class="cell">So it's actually not obvious to human beings that this is necessary. It's not obvious. Maybe for many if not all the people in this room, it does feel obvious by now. But that's probably because you've heard it over and over in Dharma teachings or other - spiritual intuition or whatever. But it's actually not _that_ obvious. We need reminding of it. So even in the context of this retreat, we actually need reminding of it, that we want to develop this willingness to open to suffering and to be touched by it. Guarding, watching out, that we don't go numb through overwhelm. So for instance, watching the news every day, reading the newspaper every day, can actually be too much, and the heart just gets numb. So taking care of that ability to open and be touched. | <span class="blockid">3-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#It has this willingness to come close\|It has this willingness to come close]]<br/><hr class="cell">So we may look, and the first thing, the sort of basis, in a way, is just a willingness to open to and to touch suffering. It's that simple. If we're out of contact, if we're not looking, if we're disconnected from the suffering in the world, there's no way compassion is going to arise, either for ourselves or for others. So it has this willingness to come close, to be intimate, to witness, to see, to feel. And that much may be obvious to people who have been practising a while, but I don't think that if we walk down Newton Abbot high street and took a survey and asked people, "Do you think it's a really good idea to open and to really experience intimately the suffering in the world, your own or others'?", I'm not sure. [laughter] I'm not sure what the survey … So it's not obvious! [laughter] And even if we've been in these kind of circles, we need reminding. That's the thing without which compassion cannot arise, that willingness to come close and to touch. |
|  | <span class="blockid">4-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#With practice we develop a confidence that we can open to suffering\|With practice we develop a confidence that we can open to suffering]]<br/><hr class="cell">And in so doing in our practice, we begin to develop a confidence that we actually _can_ open to suffering, we _can_ be intimate with pain, we _can_ look it in the face, and we can be okay. There's a confidence that comes into the heart, and that's huge. That's really huge. Because probably the reason that - I keep knocking Newton Abbot; it's probably the same - well, I don't know if it's the same in Totnes. Wherever. [laughter] I lost my track of thought. [laughter] Anyway, we develop the confidence by doing this, which is huge, because that's the one thing that would be lacking, I think, without the practice. |
| <span class="blockid">5-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#The confidence in the heart's capacity comes with time; anatta\|The confidence in the heart's capacity comes with time; anatta]]<br/><hr class="cell">Slowly, over time, we develop a confidence that we can do this. We actually develop a confidence in the heart's capacity to draw close to suffering and not be bowled over. That comes definitely with time. We become more confident in our own capacity to do that. So this willingness to open and to be touched by suffering. As I said, insight, and the deeper we go into insight and this question of how suffering arises, that will automatically, _should_ automatically bring with it compassion, particularly this strand of _anattā_ that we keep picking up in this retreat, and going into that. The more we let go of self, the looser - rather, the more we loosen our identification, the more compassion is allowed into the being. It's like literally there is more space in the heart when we're less constricting around self-definition, self-views, ownership, identification. | <span class="blockid">4-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#When there's insight into suffering compassion comes automatically\|When there's insight into suffering, compassion comes automatically]]<br/><hr class="cell">So this willingness. Insight. 'Insight,' meaning, again, how is it that human begins kind of create or co-create suffering? What are we doing that creates unnecessary suffering in the world, for ourselves and for others? That's what insight is - it's understanding how suffering is created, understanding it so deeply that we don't do it any more. When there's that insight, when there's that understanding of suffering, compassion comes automatically. Because we look around us and inside us, and we just see it's going on all the time through clinging, through ignorance, through misunderstanding. And with that insight comes compassion. As the deepening of the understanding of anattā, of this not-self, the emptiness of self, as that deepens, compassion is natural: less to protect, less barriers between you and me, less barriers between me and the world. A natural sense of non-separation. And the compassion is organic in that. |
| <span class="blockid">5-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Action i e putting ourselves in situations of service\|Action, i.e. putting ourselves in situations of service]]<br/><hr class="cell">Action. So, this is an interesting one. Sometimes as meditators we can tend to assume that all I need to do is sit here all day, or enough hours, sit and walk, sit and walk, sit and walk - and _bada-bing, bada-boom_, there it is! [laughs] Maybe, but maybe not. Action. So maybe compassion deepens through acting compassionately, through putting ourselves in situations of service, situations of volunteering, etc., where that's the actual environment. One actually acts on it. So there's certainly a movement from formal practice that flows out into the life, but the other way round as well. The actions in our life will flow back into the heart and the consciousness when we come back to sit. Most things in Dharma work both ways in terms of causality. | <span class="blockid">4-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Spending time with compassionate people and actually doing stuff\|Spending time with compassionate people and actually doing stuff]]<br/><hr class="cell">Also the importance of - the Buddha talks a lot about association with the wise in order to cultivate wisdom; as well as practice, just hanging out with people who are wise, talking with them, being with them, seeing how they live. I would add to that, association with the compassionate. Like really spending time with people who are really devoted to compassion, to service in the world. It kind of has a way of rubbing off. So a willingness to open, insights, the anattā, action. I haven't said that one yet: action, meaning actually doing stuff. We meditate, and hopefully we're transforming our intentions, we're transforming our hearts, so that spontaneously it wants to pour out into the world, it wants to pour its love out into the world, it wants to hold the suffering. We're transforming the heart gradually, reconditioning the heart at very deep levels. And so the movement is from inner to outer. But not to underestimate the movement from outer to inner. We act in the world out of service even when we're not feeling like it. We do something, we put ourselves in situations, and there are all kinds of opportunities in the world to spend some time devoted to service, to compassion. And that somehow transforms the inner as well. So action and association. |
| <span class="blockid">5-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Associate with the compassionate\|Associate with the compassionate]]<br/><hr class="cell">The Buddha has this very lovely piece of advice, and he says if you want to deepen in wisdom, associate with the wise. Basically hang out with people with insight, hang out with people who've gone deep into practice and who are living that understanding. Hang out with them, associate, let it rub off, let yourself learn from that.^[Iti 104] Well, we could say, if you want compassion to grow, associate with the compassionate. Associate with those who have given themselves to service. And there are plenty of bodhisattvas in this world, living out a life of compassion, both in the first world and the second world and the third world and - all of it. And one can seek out these people and be around them. There are a lot of remarkable beings out there. And just to let that rub off. Let something of their compassion, but also, in a way, their _abandon,_ because there's freedom in compassion. And one gets the sense of letting their _abandon_ and their freedom rub off on the being. The being absorbs that. Something very beautiful, I think, in that. |  |
| <span class="blockid">6-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Taking care of happiness allows compassion\|Taking care of happiness allows compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">What nurtures compassion? Happiness nurtures compassion as well. So this is an interesting one too. I have a friend. I think I mentioned her the other day in one of the talks. She suffers from depression periodically. And in those periods of depression she is unable to manifest, to open her heart, to allow to flow out of her what's actually very, very beautiful and deep compassion that she has in her heart. So taking care of our happiness - through all the different ways, cultivating the beautiful qualities, generosity, _samādhi_, _mettā_, all the rest of it, building the happiness gradually over our life - that happiness allows compassion. It's a foundation for compassion. The more happiness, actually, the more compassion. | <span class="blockid">4-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Happiness is a kind of foundation not only for samadhi but also for compassion\|Happiness is a kind of foundation, not only for samadhi but also for compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">And the last one, right now at least, is some degree of happiness, I would say, or well-being, or joy, or something like that, whatever word is okay for you. That when we feel a certain amount of buoyancy it's much easier for the heart to move out, to be not preoccupied with self, not burdened by life. And that happiness is a kind of foundation, not only for the samādhi, as I said, but also for compassion. |

That she would just say, "No, it's not right for you." So this is _one_ piece, but taking care of our happiness is significant. |  |

She's just one of these people that has a natural huge heart. And she has in her, for all kinds of complicated reasons, she has a history of suffering from periods of depression. And when she's in that more folded-in place, her heart just closes down. I think she _wants_ to be available, but she can't. She just doesn't have those inner resources. So taking care of our happiness, our well-being, is actually hugely important. |
| <span class="blockid">6-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Four near enemies of compassion fear anger pity grief\|Four near enemies of compassion: fear, anger, pity, grief]]<br/><hr class="cell">We might ask the flip-side question: what blocks compassion? And this is, again, a very important question. What blocks compassion? If you remember when we were talking about loving-kindness, and we talked about the near enemy of loving-kindness being attached love, love that had strings attached - so there's one near enemy of loving-kindness. There are _four_ near enemies of compassion, which in a way gives an idea of - it's actually a more subtle quality, and it's a richer quality. And in a way, it's a deeper quality. So it's very delicate. So the four are: (1) fear, (2) anger, (3) pity (not _pīti_, but pity), and (4) grief.^[Grief is identified as compassion's near enemy in Buddhaghosa, _The Path of Purification_, 311-2. Pity is identified as compassion's near enemy in Ayya Khema, _Being Nobody, Going Nowhere: Meditations on the Buddhist Path_ (Somerville, MA: Wisdom, 1987), 36. Anger, fear, and grief are listed as near enemies of compassion in Sharon Salzberg, _Lovingkindness: The Revolutionary Art of Happiness_ (Boston: Shambhala, 1995), 91] Fear, anger, pity, grief. And I'll go into these a little bit. | <span class="blockid">5-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#4 near enemies fear anger pity grief\|4 near enemies: fear, anger, pity, grief]]<br/><hr class="cell">We might ask: what nurtures compassion? The flip-side of the same question: what actually blocks it? What's not helpful? What's kind of getting in the way a little bit? And so, remembering with mettā, we talked about the near enemies of mettā, the near enemy being attached love. Compassion has four near enemies. Four things, four qualities, that arise - as human beings, they will arise for us - they can _look_ like compassion, they can be mistaken for compassion, but they're not; they're kind of diversions. And again, not that they're wrong or that we want to judge them or that they shouldn't arise and we expect them not to arise. They're actually part of having a human heart, part of our humanity, part of the learning process. So really not to judge these when they arise, or shun them or anything. Actually to look into what the differences are. So they are - I'll go through them in a bit more detail - fear, anger, pity, and grief. |
| <span class="blockid">6-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Expect them it's part of humanity and how we learn\|Expect them, it's part of humanity and how we learn]]<br/><hr class="cell">But first to reiterate this point that I said in that other talk, I think: it's not wrong that these come up and come into our practice of compassion, either in formal meditation or in our life. They _will_ come. They actually should come. It's not wrong at all to expect them. Absolutely to expect them. It's part of our humanity. It's also part of how we learn, how we learn what compassion really is in its purity. And I remember when I first heard about this, and sort of reflecting on the presence of these qualities in my life, and just actually wondering, "Well, maybe I've _never_ experienced compassion. Maybe I have no idea what it is." And that's probably swinging to too extreme a view, because I think we _all_ know what compassion is, and we have _all_ experienced that. But it's good to bring in this questioning. So this questioning is, as I said, as much a part of learning this practice as the actual cultivation and the _samādhi_ and all that. |  |
| <span class="blockid">6-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#1 Fear\|(1) Fear]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(1) Fear**, first one, fear. Touched on this. We fear opening to suffering. We fear that if I open to this person's suffering, it's going to hurt me. I'm going to feel hurt by it - so common, so normal. We fear that how can little old me hold all the suffering that's in the world, even open to a small fraction of it? How can _I_ hold that? This little sense of self will feel overwhelmed. It will feel too much. There's a real fear of that. Unfortunately, the fear itself is not neutral. And the presence of the fear actually tends to either make us feel overwhelmed, which is what we were fearing anyway, and/or increases our sense of suffering when we are open to the suffering of others. So the fear is exactly doing what we're afraid we would feel anyway. It's having the opposite effect. I'll come back to this one, the fear. | <span class="blockid">5-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Fear only compounds the suffering\|Fear only compounds the suffering]]<br/><hr class="cell">So fear. And oftentimes I've come across people practising compassion and they kind of have this relationship of fear to it. Again, fear of the suffering that they will open to, and it will be burdensome, or that they will be drowning in sadness and drowning in grief. We fear our own suffering. You know, this is very clear to us. There's emotional pain that we have or physical pain, and we have a response of fear to it. But that fear only compounds the suffering. It only adds to it. Now, we need to be very clear about this. Fear is actually not something very helpful in relationship to our own suffering, for the most part. And then in relationship to the suffering of the world, we can feel like little old me is supposed to open up to the, I don't know, maybe infinite suffering of the world, the infinite suffering of beings. And this little sense of self can feel overwhelmed. |
| <span class="blockid">7-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#2 Righteous Anger\|(2) (Righteous) Anger]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(2) Anger**. This is a really interesting one, anger. Now, oftentimes we witness suffering in the world, any form of suffering - social, environmental, political - all kinds of suffering. We just witness one person being cruel and hurtful to another, to animals, etc., to the natural world. How easy it is, and understandable, how easy it is, for the compassion to kind of get diverted, and instead of staying with the compassion, we veer off. The heart veers off into a kind of righteous anger - _so_ common and so, in a way, normal and easy for that to happen. Instead of staying with the suffering and the compassion in relation to that, we veer off into blame, judgment - either of ourselves or another. Or in the case of ourselves, "I shouldn't be feeling this" - and we judge ourselves just for feeling, for experiencing suffering. But often we're pointing the finger at someone else and blaming and getting angry, feeling justified in the anger, and we've moved away from the compassion. | <span class="blockid">5-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Compassion can be diverted into a kind of righteous indignationor judging others or ourselves\|Compassion can be diverted into a kind of righteous indignation,or judging others or ourselves]]<br/><hr class="cell">So there's fear, there's anger. And this is quite common. It's quite a seductive one, the way that we can see suffering in the world and our compassion, what might be compassion, actually gets diverted into a kind of righteous indignation or anger at what's going on. It's extremely common. We blame: "If it wasn't for them, if it wasn't for you, this wouldn't happen." Or we judge others that we see to be causing suffering in the world. Or we judge our own suffering: "I shouldn't be suffering, I'm so stupid! I've been meditating for, you know, weeks or whatever, and I'm still suffering." [laughs] But this is really important: wisdom, and the wisdom in compassion, understands the causes and the conditions that give rise to suffering, understands what the Buddha would call the 'dependent origination' of suffering. |

Anger is complex, and I touched on that also in another talk. But Dharmically speaking, that movement - the blame and the judgment - it's missing an understanding. It's missing the understanding of the causes, of what really, really does _cause_ both suffering and what allows someone to act in ways that cause suffering. It's missing the dependent origination of that, and I'll explain what I mean. |  |
| <span class="blockid">7-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Story Two politicians as difficult persons\|Story: Two politicians as difficult persons]]<br/><hr class="cell">About three or four years ago - I can't remember - I did a couple of months' personal retreat on loving-kindness and compassion. And when I got to the difficult category, I had one person that I knew and two people that I didn't know. So I had a selection, an assortment, of difficult people. And the two people are two politicians - I won't say who they are, but who it seemed to me, you know, a lot of the stuff that was happening in the world and is happening, they had a part in it, put it that way. But then as I began to take them on as part of the difficult person, I started to reflect, or needed to begin to reflect, instead of just "They're terrible," etc., beginning to reflect on the causes and conditions that, in a way, brought them into being, enabled them to be, to act, to choose, to be blind in ways that they seem blind. And in one particular politician, in the instance of one of them, just reflecting, "Well, look at his family. Look at his father and the lineage of where, what he came from. What was he educated with?" The whole movement right from day one in his life was to see a certain way, to see the world a certain way, to see others a certain way, to see self a certain way. And was educated that way. And probably through education institutions, etc. And beginning to take it away from self, _his_ self, and see more in terms of the conditions that came together. | <span class="blockid">5-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Blame judgment rightenous anger\|Blame, judgment, rightenous anger]]<br/><hr class="cell">I think I mentioned it sometime.

And two of them were these two American politicians. It was quite challenging. [laughs] And just seeing the blame, the judgment, etc., come up, the righteous anger. But as I practised with it, actually beginning to take a little bit of a broader view and seeing that, okay, this particular politician was brought up in a certain environment, he had a certain family. I mean, his father … [laughter] You know, where he was sent to school, all of it. There's no way - not _no_ way, but it would be _extremely_ a tall order to ask him, having grown up in that environment, in that family, in that education system, the whole works, to somehow extricate himself from all that and have a whole different way of seeing the world. That's not to condone some of the stuff that's going on, but this is what I'm saying about dependent origination, causes and conditions, actually seeing it. We tend to blame selves, and we don't see the bigger picture. Again, this web of causes and conditions that comes together and makes someone see something a certain way, someone do something a certain way, someone say something. |

And so we might look at this person, politician, or whoever it is, and we might think, "They don't seem to be suffering. They seem to be causing suffering, but I don't see any suffering. I see them smiling. I see them rich. I see them going on holiday." But I have a question: how much deep happiness is available for someone cultivating those qualities of heart, cultivating greed long-term? How much deep happiness is available to them? Cultivating insensitivity long-term - so, sure, they might have the riches, and they might have this and that. But in the heart, how much deep happiness is available? They're actually - when _any_ of us acts that way in the world, we're closing the doors for the possibility of deep happiness. | <span class="blockid">6-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Karma\|Karma]]<br/><hr class="cell">So there's that. There's understanding the causes and conditions and dependent origination. Really, really important when we see, when we're trying to be compassionate to those who are actually causing suffering in the world. The other part is also a reflection on karma. And this is not a kind of revenge thing. It's seeing that whoever it is that seems like they're causing suffering, they are actually causing suffering for themselves. And I'm not talking about future lives and all that stuff. In this life, it may not seem that way, but by cultivating greed, by cultivating insensitivity, by cultivating self-centredness, self-preoccupation, they are actually contracting their heart. There's a very real limit to how much a heart caught up in all of that, acting from all of that, there's a very real limit to the amount of true peace, true well-being, true joy that that heart can open to, despite what else comes their way. When we talk about karma, it's not a revenge - we don't get behind it because, "Yeah! They're going to get it!" [laughter] It's really, can we use that as a compassion, as a doorway to compassion? |

And then she said, "Not only that - wish them more SUVs." [laughs] I was like, "_Pff_, okay." [laughter] Actually, the second part of it, I couldn't do. It just seemed not possible and not even that wise, actually. But the first part was helpful. And what happened, what happened at some point was an insight arose, and a kind of coin dropped, and I realized that ignorance, delusion - these people were very nice (well, for the most part), very nice, lovely people just living their lives in the way that they thought was good. But there was, as I saw it at the time, delusion about the consequences of choices like that. And that delusion, what the Buddha calls ignorance or delusion, is not-self. Again, it's _anattā_. In a way, it doesn't belong to anyone. So here was a particular instance of delusion, which I was extracting out and then, "You are deluded. You. You. You." And just seeing: ignorance, as a quality, is something we all share. We might differ in the way it manifests in our life, but ignorance does not belong to self. Ignorance does not belong to self. We could ... Let's leave it at that. I'm worried about the time. | <span class="blockid">6-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Ignorance does not belong to anyone\|Ignorance does not belong to anyone]]<br/><hr class="cell">But what I think happened, something at a certain point shifted. Maybe it was from the mettā. And I began to see: most of these people were very nice. They were caring, considerate, friendly, etc. They just did not understand. They didn't understand. They just didn't see. They were uninformed. They just didn't make the connection. They were ignorant. One use of the word 'ignorance.' But that, I think what happened with the mettā softening it was, seeing that instead of _them_ being ignorant, I was seeing ignorance does not belong to anyone. Many instances when _I_ was ignorant, I _am_ ignorant, of course. And it's like, ignorance is part of the human condition. And instead of belonging to them, it was just like, there is ignorance, and it doesn't belong to self. And somehow in that, there was the ability to be more soft with it, and the compassion could arise. I still thought that the SUVs were really a huge shame, and then, of course, you know, September 11th happened, and people not really even seeing the connection between the oil in the Gulf and all that stuff, but anyway. |

And the Buddha talks a lot about discernment. Discernment meaning, what is it that's leading towards suffering? What is it that's leading towards the well-being of self and other? To me, you know, American - well, the world now; it's the same in London - all those SUVs, it's actually not leading to freedom from suffering. It's not helpful. Judgment would be when the self has wrapped itself around that discernment, and says, "You" or "I," "_I'm_ different. _You're_ doing this." Self is wrapped around the discernment, and it's come to be a thing about self, rather than just a thing about discerning what leads to suffering and what doesn't. So there can be discernment and still compassion, and that's really important. |

The compassion actually cannot flow. So sometimes, just realizing that ignorance doesn't belong to anyone - we all have ignorance until we're Buddhas; it just comes out in different ways - allows the compassion to come in. Sometimes, when we're angry at people, "remaining" - Buddha's words - "remaining percipient of what's beautiful," tuning into their good qualities.^[_Appaṭikūlasaññī vihareyyan_, "remain percipient of unloathsomeness," e.g. at MN 152, AN 5:144] So whoever it is, tuning into something that's lovely about them. Sometimes what we need to do, when the compassion is diverted into anger, is actually redirect the compassion towards ourselves - because when we're hardened in anger, that's _dukkha_. That's suffering. So leave the other person, and just come back to yourself. Give the compassion to the self, and the being, the heart, can soften and open. And then perhaps the compassion can flow. When we're caught up in anger, we are hurting. When we're caught up in blame and judgment, we are hurting. Sometimes we don't realize it. So, compassion to the self. | <span class="blockid">7-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Counter the anger by 'remaining percipient of the beautiful'\|Counter the anger by 'remaining percipient of the beautiful']]<br/><hr class="cell">And so the third thing, when there's anger - (1) understanding the causes and conditions, the dependent origination; (2) seeing that ignorance doesn't belong to self, that ignorance is just ignorance; (3) third thing, what the Buddha calls - it sounds a little strange - remaining percipient of the beautiful. Which means, basically, when we see difficult stuff going on, or someone acting to create suffering, we're drawn into that, and that becomes all we see. I wandered around my otherwise very nice neighbourhood; all I saw was SUVs. [laughs] The mind gets sucked into that kind of perception. 'Remain percipient' means find something in this person that's actually noble, lovely, of good intention, something to balance the lopsidedness of the view. |

Oh, and actually, one more thing: when the compassion has gone off into righteous anger or we feel that kind of anger come in, it's actually painful for us. So sometimes this might happen in the course of your practice, if you're giving compassion to the difficult person. To take a moment and just give the compassion to oneself, recognizing there's some pain there. If I'm involved in judgment, if I'm involved in blame, in anger, in all that, my heart is burning, my heart is contracted and painful. Just to take a moment, and turn round, and feel that pain, and touch it with compassion to oneself, and then to go out again. |
| <span class="blockid">9-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion holds suffering and then adds healing and understanding\|Compassion holds suffering and then adds healing and understanding]]<br/><hr class="cell">Generally, this anger, this second near enemy - compassion wants to alleviate suffering, but it doesn't want to push it away out of aversion. It's more that it holds suffering. It embraces suffering, holds it, accommodates it, and then adds healing, and adds understanding. So it's not an aversive movement; it's a holding, and a bringing in of healing and understanding. It's subtle, but it's quite a different quality. | <span class="blockid">7-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Compassion wants to alleviate suffering but not by pushing it away out of aversion\|Compassion wants to alleviate suffering, but not by pushing it away out of aversion]]<br/><hr class="cell">So it's important that aversion doesn't come into the compassion too much. Compassion wants to alleviate suffering, but it's not that it wants to push it away out of aversion - and there really _is_ a difference, and to feel in our practice and our lives the difference between those two. Compassion is not pushing away out of aversion; rather, it's almost compassion _holds_ suffering, it holds suffering, and then adds healing and understanding. So it's something quite different. |
| <span class="blockid">9-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#3 Pity\|(3) Pity]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(3)** Fear, anger, **pity**. 'Pity,' in English, as opposed to 'compassion,' means when we look down at another: "Oh, poor them, suffering like that." And we feel above it in some way. Very interesting, this is - all these are going to creep into the practice. You'll be sitting here in the room, walking up and down, and you'll just notice, "Oh, look, I've just got a bit above the person. There's just a bit of looking down come in." Sometimes it's extremely obvious; sometimes it's very subtle. Again, it's okay. Pity's an interesting one. It's disempowering. Compassion empowers; pity disempowers. So we can see for our self, when we pity ourselves, when we're caught in self-pity, it actually disempowers our self, disempowers our capacity to do anything and to move beyond the suffering. There's something almost draining and paralysing about pity. It keeps the suffering there, whereas compassion moves it, heals it, dissolves it. So compassion to self and other is empowering, not debilitating. This is very interesting. | <span class="blockid">7-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Pity is a stance of looking down\|Pity is a stance of looking down]]<br/><hr class="cell">Okay, so there's fear, as these near enemies, fear, anger, pity. Pity. And again, this can be, this can look, very similar, but you can feel it in the practice. You can actually feel it and see if you can play with it. Pity towards others is when we're looking down at them: "Oh, poor you, down there suffering, worldling!" [laughter] It creeps in, and sometimes in very subtle ways, you know: "Oh, that's not the sort of suffering _I_ get involved in" or whatever. Sometimes it's barely a thought, but there's just a stance of kind of looking down. |
| <span class="blockid">9-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#All these near enemies arise when there's too much self-view\|All these near enemies arise when there's too much self-view]]<br/><hr class="cell">All these near enemies, all of them, arise when there's too much self-view. So again, we're back to this _anattā_ business. Too much self-view - when I'm too worried about myself in fear, or too much defining the self of another in anger, or pity: "They're like this. I'm like this." Or self-pity: "This is how I am. I'll always be like this," etc., "Terrible, poor me." Too much self-view of self and other comes in, and the near enemies come up. We can counter this in practice by contemplating or seeing the commonality. We see the commonality. One's sitting in practice, giving compassion to someone, and we feel a bit above them. Remind oneself of things that are common, human things. So instead of looking at the differences - "I don't really do that. I don't suffer like that," how easily that can come in - remind oneself of what's common, the common humanity in that moment. | <span class="blockid">7-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Self-pity is disempowering\|Self-pity is disempowering]]<br/><hr class="cell">You can see it also, interestingly, in ourselves. We can somehow get into self-pity, and that's quite common. Maybe it's when we're comparing our state of suffering with others, and we're sort of down. But to see that self-pity is something _disempowering_. Compassion is something that's actually energizing and healing, and moves towards the alleviation of suffering. Self-pity will just keep it cycling. It's disempowering. It actually _keeps_ suffering there. Compassion to self and other is empowering and not debilitating. So in the practice, you can see: when has pity crept in, and is there some way I can equalize things again? |
|  | <span class="blockid">7-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Common denominator of the 4 near enemies too much self-view in the mix\|Common denominator of the 4 near enemies: too much self-view in the mix]]<br/><hr class="cell">All the near enemies, what they have in common is that there's too much self-view in the mix at that time. Whether it's anger or fear or pity, whatever, there's too much self, either my self or your self, their self. Too much selfing is going on. There's too much of that in the picture. Can we remedy that by beginning to see the commonality? See the commonality of suffering, of ignorance, of whatever it is. And so this happens as we're meditating, and sometimes we just need to make a little shift, see what's common, and it can help. So suffering is suffering, and it's something that we all have. And delusion is delusion, and it's something that we all have. |
| <span class="blockid">9-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#4 Grief\|(4) Grief]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(4)** So fear, anger, pity - the last one is **grief**. And this is a very interesting one. Very easy when we're encountering suffering, either our own or others', to be overwhelmed by it, to feel overwhelmed. And when the grief comes up as a near enemy - which sometimes can be hard to tell the difference - again, it's debilitating. Long-term, it's actually tiring. Grief is an energy that's tiring. It's a complex one, because in many instances, we actually need to feel grief. It's part of a healing process. It's a necessary quality. But at a certain point, to begin to look into it and see, is it possible there's a mechanism here that grief is actually spiralling and building? When there's grief around, if it's grief, it will be tiring. That tiring, that tiredness, it kind of makes the being, makes the heart, more vulnerable to more grief, which makes the heart _more_ tired. And it spirals on itself that way. | <span class="blockid">8-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Grief is complicated because it may be necessary but can also be draining\|Grief is complicated, because it may be necessary but can also be draining]]<br/><hr class="cell">Last one is a little bit more complicated: grief. If there's too much grief comes into the compassion practice - and it's quite common - we can feel overwhelmed. We can really feel tired and burdened, and the practice can become tiring and debilitating. It's a little bit complicated, because sometimes we touch on things and it's necessary to feel the grief and to kind of release grief. However, maybe just to add, sometimes to look into: how does grief sometimes spiral and feed itself? So grief, even if it's a very real and necessary grief, we actually feel quite tired afterwards; even if it's very real, I need to release this, there's a kind of tiredness to it. That low physical energy can then actually set up the conditions for more grief, and it can just keep going like that, because the physical energy has sunk. So just something to be aware of when we're working with grief. Some of it may be really necessary. Sometimes it might just be spiralling in an unnecessary way. For the practice of compassion, we don't want to be too much over in the grief all the time. For some, it's going to be inevitable and it's actually a beautiful thing, that the heart is touched by that. But you want it to be balanced. |
| <span class="blockid">9-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#We need to balance empathy and giving\|We need to balance empathy and giving]]<br/><hr class="cell">Let's go into this a bit more. There are two aspects of compassion - this is a really, really important point now, and I'll probably repeat it anyway, but this is really, really important - there are two aspects of compassion that need balancing. And we can talk about what I said, what I meant when I said "empathy." So that's one aspect: **(1) empathy**. And the other aspect is **(2)** the **giving**. And I'll go into this. |  |
| <span class="blockid">10-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Spaciousness and sweetness are marks of 1 empathy\|Spaciousness and sweetness are marks of (1) empathy]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(1)** So first of all, what is **empathy**? Empathy is this openness, this receptivity, this resonance of the heart with the suffering of another, feeling moved, touched by the suffering of another. But there is a kind of, I would say - spaciousness and sweetness in it are marks of empathy. So sometimes, we notice, we see the suffering of another, and somehow we've got sucked right into it, and we're just suffering the same as the other. So empathy is a little bit different. It's a bit broader and more spacious, and it has a quality of sweetness. It's actually something very beautiful and attractive for the heart in the quality of empathy. | <span class="blockid">8-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#If there's too much sadness we feel we will get tired and feel burdened\|If there's too much sadness we feel, we will get tired and feel burdened]]<br/><hr class="cell">That aspect of balance, we did talk about it the other day, and I'll just mention it again briefly, because it's really important. As we open to the suffering, there's the empathy, there's the trembling of the heart, the quivering of the heart, the sorrow that we feel at that suffering in the world, the sadness that we feel. That's natural. If there's too much of that, we _will_ get tired and feel burdened, if we emphasize that too much in practice. |

| <span class="blockid">10-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Story Auschwitz\|Story: Auschwitz]]<br/><hr class="cell">But this empathy is something very beautiful, and a very lovely, precious quality of the heart. And we may feel, at times in our life, very drawn to opening this quality of empathy. There's something - it's almost like we want to pry open the heart, pry open the being, and we want to take in the suffering in the world. I remember I'd just finished a year retreat here some years ago, and was having some time off, actually, before coming back again. And one of things I did was I took a train across Europe, and I went to Auschwitz concentration camp, extermination camp in fact. And it was sort of a bit of a pilgrimage. It was as if a part of my being wanted ... I felt - it was almost a mystery to me, in part, but a part of my being wanted to go to this place where there had been an _indescribable_ amount of suffering. I don't actually know the figures; I've forgotten how many million people died there or were killed there. And wanted to be there and just drink it all in. It's like the heart wanted to be wide and just drink it all in. |  |
| <span class="blockid">10-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Wanting to take in all the suffering is a beautiful aspiration\|Wanting to take in all the suffering is a beautiful aspiration]]<br/><hr class="cell">And actually being there - I don't know, some of you may have been - it's palpable somehow. A lot of the remains of the barracks and the gas chambers, etc., are still there. There's something palpable there. Something in the being wanted to drink it in. Just - this is the suffering. This is part of the suffering of the world. I just want to absorb it somehow. I think that's a beautiful movement, and a beautiful aspiration. At times in our life, we feel strong enough to do that; we feel open enough and spacious to do that. But there's really an important balance here. Avalokiteśvara is the bodhisattva of compassion, and one of the meanings of that is One Who Listens to the Cries of the World. Beautiful. One Who Listens to the Cries of the World. Receptive, hearing the suffering. It's a very receptive image. But the statue, the image, the _rūpa_ of it has - I don't know how many hands or arms - a lot. |  |

Why? To reach out, to give. So there's a balance of this **(1) empathy**, taking in, and **(2) giving out**. This is so, so important. We can actually address this in our practice. So you might have found today in the practice that you felt - I don't know, it's a question, actually: did you feel at times burdened, or like it was a bit heavy, or overwhelming? Yeah. Very, very common. Extremely common. It doesn't have to be this way. You can play with this. Again, you can experiment with this. We feel the empathy. We're aware of the empathy, what we're taking in. We're tuning into the suffering. But also we're aware of this - even if we're just imagining it - a healing energy going out. And we imagine that energy flowing from our body, etc. So there's something coming in and something going out. |  |
| <span class="blockid">11-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#You can play with this it's not a static balance\|You can play with this, it's not a static balance]]<br/><hr class="cell">Most people will - without even thinking about it, without even realizing it - lean the balance into more empathy, into really going into the empathy, and not so much into feeling the quality of the energy coming out: the healing, nourishing brightness, actually happy energy of what's coming out. The thing is we can play with that balance in the practice. You can actually play with it as you're sitting there. Be aware of where the balance is, and just incline the mind more towards feeling the lovely healing energy as it's going out. So you can really play with this. It's not a static balance. In other words, you're not going to find, you know, stick the dial on 5 and leave it there. You'll always be moving, and it's fine to move. And sometimes you're more in the empathy - fine. But I would say a little bit of balance towards the feeling of the loveliness and the happiness makes compassion enjoyable, sustainable, steady, equanimous, something that we like doing. And we need to kind of feel that energy in the body, that energy going, or even just imagine it. And that's really, really going to help. | <span class="blockid">8-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Find a dynamic balance with well-being and happiness\|Find a dynamic balance, with well-being and happiness]]<br/><hr class="cell">So we can be aware, as the practice is going on, of where the balance is. And you can just lean over a little bit more to feeling the energy that's more going out to heal, to soothe, to comfort. That has a kind of brightness to it. It has a kind of healing quality that's touching ourselves on its way out. And it will give the awareness, the heart, some buoyancy and some sense of well-being and happiness. And it's really, really necessary. So that the practice of compassion can be really sustainable. It doesn't feel like, "Ugh. I'm exhausted now. Can we move on to the next brahmavihāra?" It actually feels like one could just keep going with compassion, because it feels very lovely. And one can keep leaning the mind into feeling that loveliness, that nourishment of that, and feeling it in the body as well. This is really, really important. And it's not a fixed point of balance that we find; it's always going to be moving. But it's something that we can be responsive to. |

There's a third aspect of compassion, okay? So there's the empathy, and there's the giving out. There's a third aspect, which at first is not so visible, but it makes itself more known over time. In a way, I'm giving a bit of an overview this evening. **(3)** The third aspect has to do with **spaciousness**, a quality of spaciousness or an awareness of spaciousness. It's as if the sense of the heart expands and _can_ expand so that it feels almost like it fills the space, or as if the suffering in the world is being held by a compassion that, in a way, is part of the fabric of the universe. It's a kind of universal compassion. | <span class="blockid">8-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Spaciousness is holding whatever suffering arises\|Spaciousness is holding whatever suffering arises]]<br/><hr class="cell">As the practice of compassion deepens - so we're working with this balance, and we're healing, we're sensitive to suffering, and we're radiating out the healing - as it deepens, sometimes there's a possibility it deepens to, in a way, a third aspect. Not just the empathizing and the giving out, but a third aspect of what I would call 'spaciousness,' or 'equanimity' comes in, or a kind of 'holding' comes in. Sometimes it can be there really is a sense of space [that] opens up in the practice of compassion. And it's almost as if that space - the space of compassion, or could call it the space of awareness, or just the space of the universe, whatever you want to call it - somehow feels like it effortlessly and organically holds whatever suffering arises. The space feels like it's infinitely vast, and it's just there, just present. All the suffering that has arisen, that ever has arisen, all the suffering that ever will arise, all the suffering that is, is accommodated in that space. |

Begin to get glimpses of it, and it's not to make too much of this. We can sometimes get a sense of a compassion that it's not the self doing it. And it's almost like we open to some bigger sense of compassion, that the suffering in the world is _held -_ held, we could say, in the love of the universe, in the compassion of the universe, in the heart of God, whatever language works. It's almost like something deepens, and the true nature of the heart is seen as not limited, but actually infinite and vast. And it can, it has limitless capacity to hold suffering. And so this aspect of holding suffering is very much a part of compassion as it deepens. It just comes naturally. And a person might look at this in terms of God or the energy of a bodhisattva - it's all fine; it doesn't actually matter what label you give to it, to an extent. But we find that kind of opening, that kind of perception in a lot of different spiritual traditions. Julian of Norwich, the English Christian mystic: "Love is without beginning," she says. "Love is without beginning."^[Cf. Nicholas Watson and Jacqueline Jenkins, eds., _The Writings of Julian of Norwich: A Vision Showed to a Devout Woman and A Revelation of Love_ (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University, 2006), 197] It's the sense of a whole other, deeper sense of what love is, and what compassion is. | <span class="blockid">9-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Less doing more allowing compassion takes away from the sense of burden that we have\|Less doing, more allowing compassion takes away from the sense of burden that we have]]<br/><hr class="cell">And at this point, if the practice - and again, not to grasp at any of this - but if the practice deepens to that level, it's kind of like the self has gone out of it at that point. It no longer feels like I'm sitting here _doing_ the compassion practice, I'm _giving_ the compassion, the self is cranking it and out comes the compassion. It's more like there's a sitting back and allowing the space to hold the suffering, effortlessly. And that too, of course, takes away from the sense of burden - I mean, _radically_ takes away from the sense of burden that we have, or overwhelm or tiredness. It's not the self doing it. It's not even the self holding it. |

We can begin to get a sense of that sometimes. Or it can feel like it's actually a quality of the universe. It's somehow woven into the fabric of space, of the cosmos. It's there. And sometimes people want to talk then in the language of God. It makes complete sense, and absolutely, why not? It feels quite appropriate. Again, it's just words, but. Or in the language of the energy of a bodhisattva permeating the universe, the energy of Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, or Jesus or whatever, just permeating the universe. In the Christian tradition, they talk about the cosmic Christ. And one Christian mystic, Julian of Norwich said, "Love is without beginning." And sometimes the practice can just, by itself, just open up to that other space. It's a possibility. Again, not to grasp at any of this. |

And again, just reflecting how common it is for us to feel, "Well, there's so much suffering in the world, and I really don't suffer much compared to - I open the newspaper, and I see what's going on wherever it is, in Sudan or wherever." But it's hugely important to give the compassion to oneself, and it's not building ego. You might think, "Well, I'm spending all this time giving to myself. Isn't that just pumping up my ego in some way?" Ego gets pumped up through the _wrong_ kind of attention to oneself, actually through _lack_ of self-love. When there's the lack of self-love, then the ego has to go out and make itself big in the world, and make itself this or that. When there's mettā and compassion for oneself, the ego can just take its rightful place in the scheme of things. And it's tremendously healing, just that simplicity of the compassion practice to ourself. How healing that is to bathe ourselves, our lives, our bodies, our minds, in compassion. |
|  | <span class="blockid">9-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Cultivating a climate of compassion\|Cultivating a climate of compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">And then, as I mentioned briefly the other day, and just to mention them briefly, possibilities of other, sort of more _insight_ openings through compassion to oneself. When we're doing the compassion to oneself, and there's not a particularly strong suffering there - so not when there's really a lot of something difficult going on; one's just going about in one's usual, humdrum meditative day. [laughter] And there's nothing particularly dramatic going on. I'm in the here and now, giving compassion to myself, and I'm just not too absorbed in the feeling of compassion. So it's _there_, maybe, or just the phrases are there, or whatever, but there's a little bit more wideness to include what I see, and the sounds, and what I'm feeling emotionally, and the thoughts and the body sensations. Just a little bit more wideness. There's a climate of compassion, and some degree of samādhi, which may mean that the phrases have got very sparse, or not using the phrases, or it's just one word or whatever. |

So we begin to see little sufferings, little ways that we're creating suffering. And organically somehow, because of the compassion practice, we can just unhook. It just unhooks. _We_ don't really need to do it; it's just organically unhooked. You _may_ find this. You may find it. |
|  | <span class="blockid">10-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#We feel the contraction in the climate of compassion\|We feel the contraction in the climate of compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">We become conscious of what we're clinging to in the moment. And it could be, "Oh, when is this walking period going to end?" It could be we actually feel ourselves, the consciousness, move out of the here and now, and we feel with it the kind of contraction and the subtle suffering of that, in the climate of compassion, in the awareness. And it just, "May you be free." And we realize where the freedom is. It's _not_ from moving out of the here and now. And we let go of that impulse. Or we may just realize the heart is closed down a bit, and that's not where the freedom is, that's not where the healing is. And it's almost like we're not really thinking about it. It's just happening. And the heart can open again when we see it. There can be a natural letting go there. Or something we're grasping at, or we're aware of how we're building things with the self-story. So there's actually some suffering, and then we're piling on, you know, decades of history and decades of future, and mother and father and grandparents and everything. It's all piled on there, and suddenly we've got this huge conglomerate of suffering. And we're actually seeing that in the moment: "Oh, this is what I'm doing." And I'm saying, "May you be free," and we see the freedom is actually just to let go of that, and just to be with the pain - which is probably considerably less than this whole mass of built-up stuff. |
|  | <span class="blockid">10-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Giving compassion to oneself can consolidate any insight practice\|Giving compassion to oneself can consolidate any insight practice]]<br/><hr class="cell">But it could be any level of insight. So, you know, it could be one's been working with emptiness a lot, and one sees: "Oh, I've just, I've moved back into making things seem really real. I'm out of the emptiness." Or "I'm giving things solidity in time." Whatever it is. Doesn't matter. This way of practising can have a way of, I feel, kind of consolidating whatever insight feels fresh. So we feel like, you know, you're on retreat, and I'm understanding this or that about how suffering gets created, and this way of practising can actually keep it being used, keep it active, keep it fresh, consolidate it. |

And the second one that I mentioned the other day was also: compassion to self, there's some degree of calming that happens, and in the calmness there's a little more sense of just inner space. And I begin to see - don't even ask - "Who is this self I'm giving the compassion to?" And I just see mind moments of experience. A moment of an emotion, a moment of a thought, a moment of a sight, a moment of a feeling, a moment of whatever it is - suffering, a moment of ease. That's all I can find, mind moments. I actually can't find anything else. |
|  | <span class="blockid">10-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Giving compassion to mind moments\|Giving compassion to mind moments]]<br/><hr class="cell">And so the compassion practice, as it calms, can begin to feel like I'm just actually giving compassion to these mind moments. There's nothing else there. There's a mind moment, and it's being touched with compassion. So this really does begin to free up the sense of self, and free up the compassion with it. Less sense of self, more compassion. And then we can take that level of insight and actually do it the same with others. I see there's nothing _here_ but mind moments, nothing _there_ but mind moments. We give compassion to someone else and, again, the calming, we see: "I'm just giving compassion to their mind moments" - in a way, their _ownerless_ mind moments. There's no owner. They're just mind moments arising. Can give a real sense of softness and space, and emptiness, too, in the practice. This is bringing the anattā in. |

When we are suffering - compassion for self now - when we are suffering with whatever it is, it can be really helpful, it can be extremely skilful, whether it's loneliness or the body hurts or tummy ache, headache, confusion, anxiety, sadness, a sense of loss, of grief, whatever the suffering is, when there's my suffering and we're feeling it, to realize, to reflect deliberately: "My suffering is actually not different from the suffering of others." quote So again, how easy it is for us to compound our own suffering with a sense of isolation. And thinking - sometimes it's not even a conscious thought: "It's just me that has this. I'm the one that goes through this. No one else has this." Sometimes it's not even a conscious thought, and we're adding, we're stacking on the suffering by this isolating of ourselves. | <span class="blockid">10-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#My suffering is not different than the suffering of others\|My suffering is not different than the suffering of others]]<br/><hr class="cell">So like I said, these are just two options, and really not to worry if they're not - if you're not including them, they're just options. Really not a big deal. Sometimes when we are suffering - in fact, a lot of the time - we tend to regard it as _my_ suffering. _My_ loneliness, _my_ heartache, _my_ tummy ache, _my_ confusion, _my_ grief, _my_ sadness, _my_ loss, _my_, _my._ And although we know it intellectually, we actually lose sight in the moment that my suffering is not different than the suffering of others. It's really not different. |
| <span class="blockid">12-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#In the realization of the humanity there's a kind of softening\|In the realization of the humanity, there's a kind of softening]]<br/><hr class="cell">So it can be - and again, something to play with - you can, when there's suffering, just step back a little bit and deliberately reflect: "Someone, somewhere, probably even right now, is going through something extremely similar, something very similar if not almost exactly the same." Drop that in as a reflection. Sometimes our suffering - we feel our suffering, and we're actually unable to meet it with compassion. Partly this isolating of ourselves that we do is blocking the compassion. So dropping [in] this reflection, again, of the commonality of it, of the non-difference of our own suffering, dropping that in, and we open to the humanity of our own suffering. This is so crucial. And in that humanity, in the realization of the humanity, there's a kind of softening. And the being just softens. Instead of being rigidly, brittlely wrapped up in a kind of self-isolation, a self-definition and separateness, just dropping in the reflection of that commonness, that sharedness, the humanity, allows it to soften. And in the softening, there's an opening, and the compassion can begin to flow. So play with this, play with this. | <span class="blockid">11-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#When we see the humanity of the suffering compassion for ourselves can begin to come in\|When we see the humanity of the suffering, compassion for ourselves can begin to come in]]<br/><hr class="cell">So I remember being in a class with my teacher, and one of the exercises we had as a homework one week was: whenever suffering comes up, especially in meditation, seeing if you can reflect for a moment, "Someone somewhere is either going through this exact same thing right now or has." And actually bring that as a conscious reflection into the being with the suffering. Can have quite a strong effect. When we begin to see the humanity - our suffering kind of is human suffering - it can begin to soften, it can begin to open, and compassion for ourselves can begin to come in. Oftentimes with our own suffering, we're actually adding to the suffering by sort of adding an extra layer of isolation, and we don't even realize that we're doing it. We're just contracted around _my suffering_ and we don't realize the commonality, and we've added that extra layer of isolation. |
| <span class="blockid">12-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Compassion (talk)#Remind yourself that life is vulnerable\|Remind yourself that life is vulnerable]]<br/><hr class="cell">As we move on to giving compassion to others and we do the friend and benefactor and all that, sometimes we want to give compassion to someone. We look at them. We say, "Well, they don't seem to be suffering much. There's no obvious suffering. They seem pretty okay. They're pretty happy." And then one can bring to mind the vulnerability of life. So we touched on this the other day. Just reminding oneself that life is vulnerable - on a physical level, at the emotional level, at a situational level. The uncertainty of life - what a challenge it is! Even if this person seems like they're doing really okay, it's basically challenging to be human. It's basically challenging to be human. It's not easy. It's not an easy manifestation. It's not an easy territory. So sometimes to reflect on that, if one feels like this person doesn't suffer much, just to lubricate it a little bit, bring the juice in. Also to reflect, "I actually don't know. Even if I know this person well, I may not know really what's going on for them, and what possible suffering there may be there. I don't know. I don't know." | <span class="blockid">11-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#How to practice if the other person doesn't seem to have much suffering in their life\|How to practice if the other person doesn't seem to have much suffering in their life]]<br/><hr class="cell">We've opened up to all the categories now, or you can take them in order or whatever you like. But sometimes when we're in the compassion practice, we notice, "Well, I'm giving compassion to this person. They actually don't seem to have much suffering in their life, and there's really not much there." That's valid, and we don't need to kind of imagine scenarios for them or imagine that they're sitting on some repressed volcano of suffering that needs to come up from their unconscious. You know, it may be the case, but … [laughter] The compassion practice doesn't need that. When there's no obvious suffering, we can just bring to mind a kind of sensitivity, a quietening, a sensitivity. Bring to mind that it's not easy being human. It's not easy just being alive. We share a kind of vulnerability. We share uncertainty. We share the challenges of being alive. We don't need to create suffering for someone. Or just to admit: I actually don't _know_ what suffering you have in your life, what suffering you have had. I don't know what suffering is going on right now, maybe that I'm completely unaware of. I don't know what will befall you in the future. And it's that kind of "I don't know, but I know that being human, you need and are going to need compassion." |

We are one. You know, at some level, we are one - in this vulnerability, this physical vulnerability that we have. This body can get injured at any time. It can get sick very easily. The body is vulnerable. We are vulnerable to death. Reflecting, we are one in that. We share that. There's a oneness there. We are one in our uncertainty. Again, we're living in a world where things are uncertain. What happens, what will happen tomorrow, is uncertain. What will happen in the next year, for all of us, is uncertain. It's not certain at all. And probably we all know people whose life can be changed in an instant. Something happens - a piece of news, an accident, this or that - and the life is changed in an instant, dramatically, drastically. We share that. We are one in the vulnerability of that uncertainty. | <span class="blockid">11-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#Seeing the oneness in the commonality\|Seeing the oneness in the commonality]]<br/><hr class="cell">Again, bringing in this commonality, this sense of oneness. So you can actually reflect in the practice: you know, we _are_ one, we are one in all kinds of ways. At a very mystical level, certainly we are one. But in the level that we're all vulnerable, we have bodies that are vulnerable to injury, to sickness, to decay, ageing, to death. Just to reflect that we share that; really bring it in in a conscious way, as a way of supporting the compassion. Seeing the commonality, seeing the oneness. And yeah, we share death. We share, as I said, an uncertainty, that life really _is_ uncertain. And I'm sure we all know people that - or maybe ourselves - that some news or some thing has happened, and the life has been changed dramatically from one moment to the next, and we didn't know that was going to happen that morning. This is what it is to be alive, and to be in the field of the infinite web, in the field of dependent origination: that we live in an uncertain world that can change, and change dramatically, suddenly. |

We share that _avijjā_, that delusion, that bewilderment. And to extents, we all go looking for happiness, well-being, security in places that don't bring it. We share that. We share that bewilderment. We're one in that. So the more we contemplate this oneness and bring it in, the more the compassion can flow. | <span class="blockid">11-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Practice of Compassion#We share avijja\|We share avijja]]<br/><hr class="cell">We're also one in that we share a kind of bewilderment with all of this. So what the Buddha calls avijjā - we don't fully, deeply, in our hearts, in our cells, yet, completely understand about suffering: why, how suffering arises, how we make suffering. And we share that until we're completely awakened. We share that, share that misunderstanding of life, of suffering, and also of what it is that _really_ leads to happiness. So we can understand that intellectually, but actually, at another level, we're not really that clear about it or convinced of it. And so we can see that oneness, and bring that reflection of oneness in, and allow it to find its outflow in the compassion practice. |

Final point, and it has to do with this _anattā_ and this emptiness. We talk about _anattā_, the emptiness of self. We could also talk about - looking at it from another point of view - the _infinite_ nature of the self, the infinite nature of a person. So I think we've touched on this already. I can't remember. This body - where did it come from? I saw a great programme the other night about comets landing on the planet and how life actually was started by the elements that were brought from comets. Was either coming from comets or Big Bang - not Big Bang, but some supernova of other stars. Now, all this can sound kind of sci-fi, but it's actually science, that this body is coming - the elements in it come from elements that were generated in massive stars, and then those stars exploded and flung out these elements into space. And all the elements that make up our fingernails and our cornea and whatever it is - everyone in this room, the elements that made that were born in the same star. I think it's amazing!

Sometimes when we talk about emptiness, and the very word, it sounds like there's nothing there, or it sounds quite nihilistic or dry or whatever.

But - I think I did mention this at some point - the breath we take, we are permeable with the rest, certainly the earth. We breathe in air. When does it become 'me'? And breathe out. And we share the air with each other and with the trees and with the rest of life, and with the planet. There's this permeability of what I call 'me,' just on a bodily level. And the food - I think, is it Stephen Batchelor's example (can't remember) of eating a banana? It's something very mushy. Or porridge - that's another example. It's mushy.

[laughter] And as someone told me, right now, there's something like a 99.9 per cent probability that your next breath contains air molecules from the dying breath of Jesus on the cross. Things like that, you know. But we are in a constant - the air molecules come in, and they become our body. The oxygen goes into the bloodstream. We tend to see barriers and walls and discrete entities. When we look deeper, there _are_ no barriers. It's a very fluid, amorphous, non-separate thing, this body. |

Those perceptions - look, here's the radiator, here's the wall - all I can see is perceptions. Is the perception _me_, or is it out there? There's a non-separateness of self and world because perception is a double-sided feature. I need the world to see myself, because when I see, all I see is perception. When I look inside for a self, all I see is perceptions. To have a perception, I need the rest of the universe to perceive. So we can talk about emptiness. We can also say emptiness is fullness: _this_ is _full_ of everything. This being, these beings, this self is _full_ of the universe. The mind and the body (we'll have questions after) - not separate, not separate.

Then there's body sensation, there's all of that, or inner perceptions. No perception, no mind. They go together. To have a mind, you need to have a perception. If there's no world, there's no perception and no mind. The mind is inextricably linked up with what it perceives, which is the universe. Mind is not separate from the world. It _feels_ separate.
