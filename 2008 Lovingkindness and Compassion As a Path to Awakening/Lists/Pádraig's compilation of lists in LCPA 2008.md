##### [[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Three major fruits from this retreat|Three major fruits]] that can be expected from this retreat
1. The development of loving-kindness and compassion, developing those qualities in the heart. And that’s a beautiful thing; it’s an indispensable and lovely thing for a human being to develop that.   
2. understanding how that leads to awakening, actually using loving-kindness and compassion to move towards awakening, and understanding emptiness and that kind of liberation of the heart, liberation of the mind.
3. the development of samādhi, the development of concentration. 
    
##### Working with Hindrances
1. if possible, **[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#No being taken for a ride not taking them personally|not being taken for a ride,]]** recognizing, “This is what’s going on. Ah, it’s such-and-such a hindrance. Aha! Okay,” and not getting so seduced or infatuated by the story and the content of what it seems that’s going on – this craving or aversion or whatever it is, or the doubt. Seeing it for what it is, recognizing it – huge. Half the battle is right there.   
2. And **not taking them personally**, so not judging oneself because of the presence of a hindrance. 

##### 4 objections to samadhi practice ( involving staying with a theme over a period of time)
1. **[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#1 Tightness|Tightness]].** In the process, we actually feel quite tight – and you may have, probably, discovered that 6 already. Trying to stay with something, you’re trying, and it can feel really tight. The very effort to stay with something can feel tight.
2. The whole notion of **[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#2 Working towards a goal|working towards a goal]],** a goal of deepening my concentration or developing samādhi or developing mettā, and “Won’t I get into some striving around that?” …..relationship with goals and striving for goals.
3. **[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#3 Attachment|Attachment]]** – if this leads to happiness or if samādhi feels good, won’t I maybe get attached there, and get stuck there?
4. **[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#4 Suppression|Suppression]]**. Is it possible that through this just, you know, repeating phrases to myself, or just staying with one thing and maybe even feeling good in doing that, that I’m actually suppressing some emotion or some issue in the being, in the psyche, that needs to come up? Someone brought that up this morning
  
##### Addressing each of these 4 objections
1. **[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#ad 1 tightness|Tightness]]**: apply softness. make the mindfulness a bit bigger, meaning make the range of the awareness a bit bigger….. “sensitive to the whole body”.....**an awareness that includes the whole body**? And to be anchored in that. And as well, in this breadth of mindfulness, an awareness of, “How am I feeling about the practice right now? What’s my emotional relationship with the practice right now? Am I bored? Am I trying too hard? Am I disinterested? Am I striving?” The body sense can reflect this relationship that we have with the practice in the moment. When we get too tight, what happens? We actually feel it in the body. So part of the art of meditation, part of the art of deepening samādhi, is to have this kind of background awareness of breath of the body awareness, and be sensitive to it. It will reflect what’s going on in terms of the relationship...gentleness and relaxation in the approach...**kindness and gentleness**.  In this body sensitivity, you can feel when there’s too much effort because the body reflects it – tightness in the shoulders, or the belly gets tight, or something just cramps up a little bit. And be sensitive to that, as part of the practice, and relax it.
2. **[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#ad 2 goals our life is full of goals|Goals]]**:  to really understand non-duality – it’s hard to really understand at any depth without a depth of samādhi, funnily enough. It’s actually going through all this, and this efforting, and even a notion of goals with the samādhi, that actually brings a whole reorientation in terms of dualities and goals – because usually, people are too quick with saying, “Oh it’s all non-dual. There’s nothing to get.” But they **fall back on a default perception**, a default understanding of the way things are, and it’s still, “I’m here, and this is what’s going on for me: the mind is cloudy, or the mind is like this, or whatever. And that’s okay, and that’s where the non-duality comes.” So any kind of pleasantness, sense of well-being, sense of comfort, pleasure in the body, physical, you want to encourage. 
3. **[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#ad 3 attachment - - feeling good doesn't lead to attachment|Attachment to Samadhi]]**: “If it feels good, might I not get attached to that? And that would be bad.” It actually doesn’t lead to attachment in the long term. It might if one just has one or two isolated experiences, but as one develops it over time, it does not lead to attachment. The pleasure of meditation does not lead to attachment. It does not lead to attachment. So if there’s any kind of – even if it’s unremarkable – sense of enjoying the practice, really  let yourself enjoy it. See if you can bring that in and mix it in with what’s going on. **Open to the enjoyment**, however it is. It’s actually fine to get attached to this. The being matures, the consciousness matures, and it lets go of that attachment. Don’t worry about it. Go ahead.
4. **[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#ad 4 suppression|Suppression]]**. Is it possible that if I just focus on something, and I even feel good in that, and just keep doing the mettā, that I’m actually suppressing something that needs to come up emotionally, something in my psyche, in the being that needs to come up? We tend to think of a storehouse of old emotions: “Here’s anger. I need to release it. I need it to come up.” But it cannot come up unless the conditions in the present moment are there for it to come up. And sometimes when we’re really clear, we can actually see this process, that if we don’t feed it in the present, it doesn’t come up. It cannot come up. When we see this over and over, we begin to see that some of the issues that we feel we have, emotionally, are actually – in Dharma language, they’re empty. They’re empty of inherent existence. They don’t exist by themselves. **They don’t have self-existence. They need me to do something in the present**. ….samādhi is actually making less and less. We’re doing less and less. It’s very, very interesting – it’s not obvious at all. As we make less and less, we make less and less self, and there’s more and more love coming out of that. We begin to see this emptiness of things. It comes out of the mettā practice and out of the samādhi practice. Begin to see that things cannot be ‘things’ without me doing something

##### The blindness of anger
1. **[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Blind to its causes|Blind to its causes]]**, what we don’t see is the whole inner constellation, or both inner and outer constellation of, conditions that allow the anger to be
2. **[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Blind to its effects - - Story punching bag|Blind to its effects]]**, both energetically and on others
3. **[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Blind to itself|Blind to itself]]**, What am I building when I vent anger? What am I crystallizing and conditioning in myself, and in the relationship, and in others?  

## Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion
[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion|Talk]]
[Audio](https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/11956/)
[Transcript](https://airtable.com/shr9OS6jqmWvWTG5g/tblHlCKWIIhZzEFMk/viw3k0IfSo0Dve9ZJ/recsBRljydmRTxSG7/fldC5Okhw9Ay3uEZq/att0F1tecvEIEoXQp)

**Three Characteristics (7 ways to practice with these in total, outlined below)**

##### [[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#1 Anicca impermanence|Anicca]] (impermanence)
1. remembering **[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#a Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life|death]]** – remembering death and the unpredictability of life. just holding this lightly, this sense of anicca that others are vulnerable to, holding that in the awareness very lightly, as one’s doing the mettā, can either kick-start the mettā when it feels like it’s a little bit blocked or it can’t really get off the ground, or deepen it at times when it already feels like it’s going.
2. practising learning to see this moment in the context of our death..There’s **[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#b Having a sense of one's life as a tiny span in the vastness of time and space|this moment in the context of a massive, almost unfathomably unthinkable unknown.]]** And you can toy with this playing of perception. Something comes: this moment, death, and vastness. And again, instead of unlocking fear, sometimes it can unlock more love.
3. trying to look, in the moment, at quite a **[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#c moment-to-moment impermanence|rapid, moment-to-moment impermanence of phenomena]]**.you’re doing the mettā, and you can just open the awareness up a little bit more to this impermanence.
4. All I find when I look for myself are **[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#d In all the change all what I can find are perceptions|perceptions, and those perceptions are not separate from the universe, from the world]].** We tend to think of the self as something separate and independent. When I look for it, all I find are perceptions, which are actually inseparable from the rest of the universe. 

#####  [[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#2 dukkha unsatisfactoriness suffering|Dukkha]] (unsatisfactorinesss)
1. one is doing the mettā practice, and just to drop in, directing it to someone else, just to drop in, “We’re all in the same boat. **We all share these encounters with suffering in our life. We all meet suffering in all kinds of ways** – through the difficulties we have in relationship, and circumstance, and life, and experience, internally in the body and the mind”
2. just lightly put your attention in the chest area – in the heart centre, the heart chakra, just lightly keep the attention there, and you notice how it opens and closes. The actual sense, energetically, or even subtly physically, of the heart, heart centre, opens and closes. And it will open and close many times in a day, countless times in our life. Opens and closes. If you just have a light attention and interest there to when it’s open and when it’s closed, the heart centre, what you notice is: when there’s clinging, guess what? [laughs] Closed, no entry! When we release clinging, the heart centre opens. **And just to be aware, use the body sense to be aware: “Is there clinging right now? Am I pushing, pulling, struggling with things, experience, in the moment? If there is, can I relax that clinging, let go of it, relax the body, relax the clinging?”** See what happens to the love. Again, it can kick-start the mettā when it feels blocked, or like it’s not really getting anywhere off the ground in any moment. Or it can deepen it. And one can actually – all of these, one can stay with them and let the mettā deepen with them and through them.
    
##### [[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#3 Anatta not-self|Anatta]] (not-self)
We can practise a way of looking – regarding our experience as ‘not me’ and ‘not mine,’ ‘not-self.’ **look at the experience through a lens of ‘it’s just happening, it’s not me, it’s not mine.’** 

## Compassion
[[Compassion (talk)|Talk]]
[Audio](https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/11950/)
[Transcript](https://airtable.com/shr9OS6jqmWvWTG5g/tblHlCKWIIhZzEFMk/viw3k0IfSo0Dve9ZJ/recsPuKTDTD4tysuC/fldC5Okhw9Ay3uEZq/att254AqpLGMW2aTz)

##### What nurtures compassion?
1. [[Compassion (talk)#Willingness to open and touch suffering nurtures compassion|a willingness to allow the heart to open]], to be touched by suffering, to draw close, to keep the eyes open, to keep the being open, and 4 touch, witness, feel suffering
2. [[Compassion (talk)#Action i e putting ourselves in situations of service|acting compassionately]], through putting ourselves in situations of service, situations of volunteering
3. [[Compassion (talk)#Associate with the compassionate|associate with the compassionate]]. Associate with those who have given themselves to service.
4. [[Compassion (talk)#Taking care of happiness allows compassion|taking care of our happiness]] – through all the different ways, cultivating the beautiful qualities, generosity, samādhi, mettā, all the rest of it, building the happiness gradually over our life – that happiness allows compassion.

##### What blocks compassion?
1. **[[Compassion (talk)#1 Fear|Fear]].** If I open to this person’s suffering, it’s going to hurt me. And the presence of the fear actually tends to either make us feel overwhelmed, which is what we were fearing anyway, and/or increases our sense of suffering when we are open to the suffering of others.
2. **[[Compassion (talk)#2 Righteous Anger|Anger]].** But dharmically speaking, that movement – the blame and the judgment – it’s missing an understanding. It’s missing the understanding of the causes, of what really, really does cause both suffering and what allows someone to act in ways that cause suffering. It’s missing the dependent origination of that
3. **[[Compassion (talk)#3 Pity|Pity]].** Compassion empowers; pity disempowers. So we can see for our self, when we pity ourselves, when we’re caught in self-pity, it actually disempowers our self, disempowers our capacity to do anything and to move beyond the suffering.
4. **[[Compassion (talk)#4 Grief|Grief]].**  when the grief comes up as a near enemy – which sometimes can be hard to tell the difference – again, it’s debilitating. Long-term, it’s actually tiring. Grief is an energy that’s tiring. It’s a complex one, because in many instances, we actually need to feel grief. It’s part of a healing process. It’s a necessary quality. But at a certain point, to begin to look into it and see, is it possible there’s a mechanism here that grief is actually spiralling and building?

##### 3 aspects of compassion
1. **[[Compassion (talk)#Spaciousness and sweetness are marks of 1 empathy|Empathy]].**  Empathy is this openness, this receptivity, this resonance of the heart with the suffering of another, feeling moved, touched by the suffering of another. But there is a kind of, I would say – spaciousness and sweetness in it are marks of empathy
2. **[[Compassion (talk)#Balance this with a healing energy 2 giving out|Giving]].** feeling the quality of the energy coming out: the healing, nourishing brightness, actually happy energy of what’s coming out. 
3. **[[Compassion (talk)#3 Spaciousness|Spaciousness]].**  It’s as if the sense of the heart expands and can expand so that it feels almost like it fills the space, or as if the suffering in the world is being held by a compassion that, in a way, is part of the fabric of the universe. It’s a kind of universal compassion.

## Compassion Part Two (Compassion for ourselves)  
[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves|Talk]]
[Audio](https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/11949/)
[Transcript](https://airtable.com/shr9OS6jqmWvWTG5g/tblHlCKWIIhZzEFMk/viw3k0IfSo0Dve9ZJ/rec6ZUSgKTvJQv5AR/fldC5Okhw9Ay3uEZq/attFrzwPcaA0Umtdw)

##### Two Possibilities
1. there can be a **[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#1 Use the climate of compassion as a lense|climate of compassion]].** You can use that whole climate and the practice as a kind of lens to look at one’s experience in the moment, and to see any kind of suffering, any kind of subtle suffering, and to unhook it.
2.  **[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#2 Compassion to self is compassion to mind moments|compassion to mind moments]].** So when I give compassion to myself and there’s suffering – big suffering or little suffering – what I’m really encountering is moments of mind, moments of awareness with something going on in them. Not a self – I don’t ever encounter a self. What I encounter is **moments of mind with something happening in that mind moment, moments of awareness.** Or you could say the self that I encounter is just really mind moments. It’s just mind moments.
