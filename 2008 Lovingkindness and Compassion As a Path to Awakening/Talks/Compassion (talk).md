## Paragraphs
[[Compassion (talk) -|plain list]]

##### What does the word "compassion" mean?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Compassion (talk) > ^1-1" data-href="0204 Compassion (talk)#^1-1" class="internal-link">1-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11950/20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=00:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So this morning we introduced the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practice, and I really want to, in a way, amplify and extend some of the things I talked about this morning, and to fill that out, to broaden it, and look at what's involved in the practice of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, and also the question, what actually _is_ <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>? What does that word mean?</span>

---
##### Compassion is the heart's natural response to suffering
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Compassion (talk) > ^1-2" data-href="0204 Compassion (talk)#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (5) · <a data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">Brahmaviharas</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (3) · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> (2) · <a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11950/20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=00:25" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So as you know, <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is the second of the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a>_. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Loving-kindness</a>, <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> - it's the second one. We _could_ say that ==<a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is the heart's natural response to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> when not preoccupied with self, or not caught up in a negative self-view.== <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a>, perhaps - one <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a> at <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is the natural response of the heart to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> when not preoccupied with self, or not caught up in a negative <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a> - so it includes _our_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>.</span>

---
##### It wants to alleviate the suffering
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Compassion (talk) > ^1-3" data-href="0204 Compassion (talk)#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3) · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (4) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (3)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11950/20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=01:20" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is that quality, that <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>, that wants to alleviate the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> that it meets. It wants to do something about it. It wants to heal it - wants to alleviate, wants to heal, wants to soothe, wants to comfort, wants to free that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> either in ourselves or in another being, either by changing the circumstance, by comforting, by providing some <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> - in any way at all. And as I said this morning, ==when the stream of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, the stream of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> -_ if it's running, when it meets <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, it turns organically and very naturally into compassion.== <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Loving-kindness</a> meets <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, and it will become <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> in that moment.</span>

---
##### Compassion has many aspects to it
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Compassion (talk) > ^1-4" data-href="0204 Compassion (talk)#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3) · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11950/20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=02:18" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So we have this word '<a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>,' and it's a great - it's a beautiful word. In a way, '<a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>,' like all these other <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> words, is a kind of composite. There are many factors and aspects involved in it. It's great to have one word, and it's helpful to have one word, and to know what we mean when we say that. But when we start really looking at what <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is, it has many, many aspects to it.</span>

---
##### It includes empathy, and giving
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Compassion (talk) > ^1-5" data-href="0204 Compassion (talk)#^1-5" class="internal-link">1-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3) · <a data-href="Empathy" class="internal-link">Empathy</a> · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11950/20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=02:47" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph"><a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> includes <a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a>, and I'll speak about that more tonight. It includes giving, so giving is an aspect of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. What are we giving? And as such, <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is something very active. Even if it's just energetically on the cushion, in the <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>, but very much in the world, it's giving something.</span>

---
##### Compassion also includes the steadiness of equanimity, and wisdom
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Compassion (talk) > ^1-6" data-href="0204 Compassion (talk)#^1-6" class="internal-link">1-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (7) · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> · <a data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">Steadiness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (4) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (6) · <a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11950/20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=03:14" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph"><a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> also includes <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, this <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> of the being, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness of the mind</a> and the heart. And that's actually an indispensable factor of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, if we want our <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> to be sustainable, to be strong, to be open, to last in the world, to be able to bear up, keep open, face up to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> that we encounter in this world. <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> has <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> in it. And this is really crucial. In a way, as both <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> goes deeper and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> goes deeper, they begin to really come together. ==But <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> as such is not blind. <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> has in it some degree of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> of what the causes of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> are, and in it, a willingness and a wish to uncover the causes of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, at as deep a level as possible.== So very much has <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> in it. If we talk about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> and <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>, that's what that means: we want to understand how <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> comes about, in ways that bring <a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a>.</span>

---
##### Compassion has kindness in it, and acceptance, and listening, and a quality of opening, and happiness, and faith
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Compassion (talk) > ^1-7" data-href="0204 Compassion (talk)#^1-7" class="internal-link">1-7</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (10) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Acceptance" class="internal-link">Acceptance</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (2) · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a> · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">Devotion</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11950/20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=04:27" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph"><a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> of course has _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ in it, has <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a> in it. <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> has <a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a> in it, so that's an interesting one. Alongside the wish to alleviate <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, it also has <a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a> of the fact of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> can have humour in it, often _does_ have humour in it. So it's not necessarily a heavy <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>; it can be very light. <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> has listening. ==Listening is very much a quality of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. Sometimes we encounter someone, we're with someone - there's nothing we can do for their situation except listen, except open ourselves in that way. And that's <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. When in a way one's giving the listening, although it's a kind of receiving, one's giving that, offering that.== Opening - <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> has this quality of opening. <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> actually has <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> in it. <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> is a factor of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> has <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a> in it - this is a very interesting one - has <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a> in it.</span>

##### Like metta, compassion is not just a feeling
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Compassion (talk) > ^2-1" data-href="0204 Compassion (talk)#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3) · <a data-href="Healing" class="internal-link">Healing</a> · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a> · <a data-href="Feelings" class="internal-link">Feelings</a> · <a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11950/20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=05:36" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And like we said with the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice, it's not just a feeling. So sometimes we get a definite _feeling_ of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> and that tenderness and that resonance and that warmth flowing out, that <a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a> <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> flowing out. But it's not just a feeling. It's actually much more than that. ==And if in our life our <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is restricted to when we _feel_ it, that's too limited. Sometimes in our life we _don't_ feel it, but we act still. We _do_, we _act_ with <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. We embody that intention. We cannot feel it all the time because <a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a> are impermanent== - same as what we talked about with the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_.</span>

---
##### It's easy to see compassion as a kind of burden
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Compassion (talk) > ^2-2" data-href="0204 Compassion (talk)#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (4) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11950/20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=06:20" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Now, most people, if we're honest with ourselves, the relationship to <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> or the idea of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is ambivalent. We have a pretty ambivalent relationship to the intention of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. Very, very common, and very understandable and easy, to see <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, regard it as a kind of burden. Here, somehow, am I going to be burdened with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> of the world? And everyone in this room is aware of the kind of magnitude and enormity of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the world. And somehow the idea of opening to that feels like a burden - despite, or alongside, our best spiritual aspirations.</span>

##### We fear that compassion will overwhelm us

<span class="paragraph">We aspire to be compassionate, and yet there's this ambivalence. We also feel, "Well [sighs] ... I don't know. I don't know." We feel, we <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> that <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> will overwhelm us, will drown us, will make us unhappy. We _can_ <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> that. When <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> gets deeper, we realize that actually, lack of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, if our hearts are _not_ open in <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, _that's_ actually <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. Something about the closed-over heart, the hardened heart - that's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. And we could talk about, again - it's not a great word, but this word 'maturity' in practice. Part of maturity in practice is when that <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> has got deep enough, that we know that it's more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> for the heart to be closed and to live without <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> than it might be to feel overwhelmed by <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>.</span>

##### Through compassion we are reconnecting with our heart

<span class="paragraph">So there's this ambivalence. And at the same time as this <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> or trepidation we might feel, at the same time we have a real intuitive - I think most of us wouldn't be in this room if we didn't - this intuitive <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and almost a yearning for <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. It's like we sense something there. The being, the heart, senses a possibility for itself, senses a depth of possibility for itself, and <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a> for itself. And a part of us yearns for that, longs for that, senses that possibility, because ==I think a part of us realizes that through <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> and in <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, there's a very deep connection going on. There's a very deep _reconnection_ going on. We are reconnecting to ourselves, some very deep aspect of ourselves, of our being, of our heart.== Reconnecting with our heart. Connecting and reconnecting with 'other.' Very much and very deep - the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practice has something very deep about that reconnecting, and we long for that. As much as we shore up our own individuality and separateness, we long for this connection that comes so powerfully through <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practice.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Sense of sweetness, energizing We may also have a sense of the sweetness in <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practice. So even though there's this trepidation, we can sense that there's a sweetness there for the heart, a really lovely sweetness. <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a>, too, is energizing. It's actually an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Energy" data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">energizing quality</a>. I'm going to come back to this later. <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> should be energizing rather than tiring. <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> should also be pleasant rather than unpleasant. ==Even though we're opening ourselves to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, we're tuning into <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, we're looking at it, we're willing to let the heart resonate with it - still, <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasant quality</a>.

##### There's lovely warmth in compassion, and nobility, something to be proud of

<span class="paragraph">There's warmth in it. There's lovely warmth in <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. And as the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> would say, it's something that gives the being <a data-href="nobility" class="internal-link">nobility</a>. It gives the being a very deep and beautiful, organic <a data-href="nobility" class="internal-link">nobility</a>, a natural <a data-href="nobility" class="internal-link">nobility</a> to the being. Something of which we can feel proud. When that quality is there, we can feel proud in a very healthy, non-egoistic way.</span>

##### Compassion dissolves the prison of self-interest

<span class="paragraph">There's also a sense - we might have this sense with <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> that the movement into the depths of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> begins to, or _will_ begin to, dissolve the kind of prison of self-interest. So we may feel in our lives, or the more practice - as we begin to practice, we may feel how this self-interest is a prison. We're binding ourselves in it. So we have this sense, this intuitive sense, that as we go into <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, perhaps that prison of self-interest will be a little dissolved, or a _lot_ dissolved. Now, we may be very attracted to that, but again, we may be pretty ambivalent about it.</span>

<span class="paragraph">In a way, a fundamental part of the fundamental <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a>, Dharmically speaking, is this belief in a separate, independent self. Somehow we're caught up in that belief, and we believe it, and we keep reinforcing it with <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>-interest. And through practices like <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, and as the <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> comes out of those practices, as the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ deepens, as the heart opens, there is a sense of that self softening and opening, in a very non-linear way - very gradual, glimpses of it at first, then a bit more, etc. The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a> begins to soften, can begin to open, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a> into the whole <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a> of self and other, etc., come with that - _can_ come with that.</span>

##### We can't really be fully fulfilled pursuing happiness through self-centredness

<span class="paragraph">But alongside that is a sort of very basic <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>, and it's that we begin to realize that we can't really be fully fulfilled pursuing <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> through <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-centredness</a>. It just takes time, but eventually the coin just drops. It just drops. This is the pattern we inherit. You could [say], in strict <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> terms, we inherit if from our previous lives, this self-<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a> that's caught up in a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a> for <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>, searching for <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>, going about it through <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-centredness</a>. Something can begin to happen through <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> and through <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>: that whole project, we realize, cannot fulfil us.

##### "My religion is kindness. My religion is compassion."

<span class="paragraph">But I would say, and I really would say this, that there can come a point with practices like these - <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> and <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practices - it's almost like the <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> reaches an edge. And one can feel rising in oneself a conviction: "I'm not interested any more in living a life with self at the <a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a>. I'm just" - that whole view and outlook of life which seems so natural, _so_ natural, it just begins to lose its compulsivity or its convincingness. And a person can really reach a point - something's like, "It just doesn't do it for me any more. I'm just not interested in that any more." Something has, you could say, broken in the heart. Something has melted in the heart. Don't want self to be the <a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a> of the stage any more, or the <a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a> of the life stage necessarily. As these practices go on - again, they're very non-linear, but there comes a deeper and deeper commitment to this, a deeper and deeper commitment to <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and to <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> and to living less from <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>, about <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>, for <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>. So the <a data-href="Dalai Lama" class="internal-link">Dalai Lama</a> is fond of saying, "My religion is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>."^[Margaret Gee, _Words of Wisdom: Quotes from His Holiness the Dalai Lama_ (Kansas City: Andrew McMeel Publishing, 2001), 23] So instead of explaining all the complex Buddhist philosophy, etc., he just says, "My religion is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>. My religion is <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>."</span>

<span class="paragraph">So, like I mentioned - was it the last talk? - we need to be asking questions with this. <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> practice has a lot of <a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a> in it, but it also has a lot of questioning in it. All these practices, there's an aliveness of inquiry. And part of what we're asking is, what is <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>? What does it mean? But we're also asking this other question, or we're asking a _number_ of other questions. And it's important, it's _crucial,_ it's really crucial for a life of practice that we're asking the right questions both of ourselves, of our lives, but of our practice. Are we asking the right questions? It's so important.</span>

<span class="paragraph">I only know two things about <a data-href="Gertrude Stein" class="internal-link">Gertrude Stein</a>, the writer. One of them is that when she was on her deathbed, she was surrounded by her sort of entourage of admirers. You know <a data-href="Gertrude Stein" class="internal-link">Gertrude Stein</a> the writer? [laughter] She was surrounded by this entourage of admirers. She was obviously dying. She was slipping in and out of <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>, in and out of - I don't know if it was coma or what, but in and out of <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>, certainly. And it appeared to the people around her that she would sort of go into the 'next world,' so to speak, pass beyond, and then come back. And she kept doing that. And one of her entourage, whose name, I think, was Mildred something or other (I can't remember), because it seemed like she was passing beyond and sort of coming back - "Well, maybe she's coming back with some <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> and knowledge that she could impart to us of greater things." And so when Gertrude sort of reappeared and had a bit of <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>, she said, "Gertrude, what's the answer?" And Gertrude sort of opened her eyes. "Mildred, what's the question?"^[Cf. James R. Mellow, _Charmed Circle: Gertrude Stein and Company_ (New York: Praeger, 1974), 468] [laughter]</span>

<span class="paragraph">And in a way, it's very much ... We're looking for answers, but are we actually clear what the right questions are? What are the right questions in life?

Not just what is it, but how do we go about it? What brings it about? It's very much a part of - we need to be actively engaged in that questioning. And so, as I mentioned this morning, there are many techniques involved, many techniques. We've chosen the phrases. It's fine. It's a good one to start with. _<a data-href="Tonglen" class="internal-link">Tonglen</a>_ was mentioned, this Tibetan practice of - literally it means 'giving and taking' or 'taking and giving.'

But of course, developing <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is not something that we just do in a formal way, like it's not just something we do in formal <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation practice</a>. It, in a way, _can_ become or _needs_ to become a current in our life. There's a current of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. What is it to live a life that has that beautiful, deep current of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> running, in a way, in a very central place in the life? In a way, the life is actually running along, flowing along, carried along on that stream of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>.</span>

##### Willingness to open and touch suffering nurtures compassion

What allows it to grow? The sort of simplest piece of it, the most fundamental piece, is a willingness to open and to touch <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. It's a willingness to allow the heart to open, to be touched by <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, to draw close, to keep the eyes open, to keep the being open, and touch, witness, feel <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. That's what the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> calls the 'proximate condition' - actually what the _<a data-href="commentaries" class="internal-link">commentaries</a>_ call the 'proximate condition' - for <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>.^[Cf. Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa, _The Path of Purification: Visuddhimagga_, tr. Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli (Onalaska, WA: Pariyatti, 1999), 310] Now, willingness to open and touch <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> - for a lot of people in the world, that's not an obvious choice. There's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> - "See you later! I don't want to know. I want to get as far away from it as possible. I want to protect myself, protect the heart. I don't want to feel that. I don't want to be hurt. It's too much. I don't want to be bothered" - either one's own <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> or the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the world.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So it's actually not obvious to human beings that this is necessary. It's not obvious. Maybe for many if not all the people in this room, it does feel obvious by now. But that's probably because you've heard it over and over in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma teachings</a> or other - spiritual intuition or whatever. But it's actually not _that_ obvious. We need reminding of it. So even in the context of this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, we actually need reminding of it, that we want to develop this willingness to open to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> and to be touched by it. Guarding, watching out, that we don't go numb through overwhelm. So for instance, watching the news every day, reading the newspaper every day, can actually be too much, and the heart just gets numb. So taking care of that ability to open and be touched.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Slowly, over time, we develop a confidence that we can do this. We actually develop a confidence in the heart's capacity to draw close to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> and not be bowled over. That comes definitely with time. We become more confident in our own capacity to do that. So this willingness to open and to be touched by <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. As I said, <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>, and the deeper we go into <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> and this question of how <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> arises, that will automatically, _should_ automatically bring with it <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, particularly this strand of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>_ that we keep picking up in this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, and going into that. ==The more we let go of self, the looser - rather, the more we loosen our identification, the more <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is allowed into the being.

##### Action, i.e. putting ourselves in situations of service

<span class="paragraph">Action. So, this is an interesting one. Sometimes as meditators we can tend to assume that all I need to do is sit here all day, or enough hours, sit and walk, sit and walk, sit and walk - and _bada-bing, bada-boom_, there it is! [laughs] Maybe, but maybe not. Action. So maybe <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> deepens through acting compassionately, through putting ourselves in situations of service, situations of volunteering, etc., where that's the actual environment. One actually acts on it. ==So there's certainly a movement from formal practice that flows out into the life, but the other way round as well. The actions in our life will flow back into the heart and the <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> when we come back to sit. Most things in <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> work both ways in terms of causality.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> has this very lovely piece of advice, and he says if you want to deepen in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a>, associate with the wise.

Hang out with them, associate, let it rub off, let yourself learn from that.^[Iti 104] Well, we could say, if you want <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> to grow, associate with the compassionate. Associate with those who have given themselves to service. ==And there are plenty of bodhisattvas in this world, living out a life of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, both in the first world and the second world and the third world and - all of it. And one can seek out these people and be around them. There are a lot of remarkable beings out there. And just to let that rub off. Let something of their <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, but also, in a way, their _abandon,_ because there's <a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a> in compassion.== And one gets the sense of letting their _abandon_ and their <a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a> rub off on the being. The being absorbs that. Something very beautiful, I think, in that.</span>

<span class="paragraph">We might ask the flip-side question: what blocks <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>? And this is, again, a very important question. What blocks <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>? If you remember when we were talking about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, and we talked about the <a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a> of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> being attached <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> that had strings attached - so there's one <a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a> of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>. There are _four_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Near enemy" data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemies</a> of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, which in a way gives an idea of - it's actually a more subtle quality, and it's a richer quality. And in a way, it's a deeper quality. So it's very delicate. So the four are: (1) <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, (2) <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>, (3) <a data-href="pity" class="internal-link">pity</a> (not _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>_, but <a data-href="pity" class="internal-link">pity</a>), and (4) <a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a>.^[Grief is identified as compassion's near enemy in Buddhaghosa, _The Path of Purification_, 311-2. Pity is identified as compassion's near enemy in Ayya Khema, _Being Nobody, Going Nowhere: Meditations on the Buddhist Path_ (Somerville, MA: Wisdom, 1987), 36. Anger, fear, and grief are listed as near enemies of compassion in Sharon Salzberg, _Lovingkindness: The Revolutionary Art of Happiness_ (Boston: Shambhala, 1995), 91] <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a>, <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>, <a data-href="pity" class="internal-link">pity</a>, <a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a>.

<span class="paragraph">But first to reiterate this point that I said in that other talk, I think: it's not wrong that these come up and come into our practice of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, either in formal <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> or in our life. They _will_ come. They actually should come. It's not wrong at all to expect them. Absolutely to expect them. It's part of our humanity. It's also part of how we learn, how we learn what <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> really is in its purity. And I remember when I first heard about this, and sort of reflecting on the presence of these qualities in my life, and just actually wondering, "Well, maybe I've _never_ experienced <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. Maybe I have no idea what it is." And that's probably swinging to too extreme a view, because I think we _all_ know what <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is, and we have _all_ experienced that. But it's good to bring in this questioning. So this questioning is, as I said, as much a part of learning this practice as the actual <a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a> and the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ and all that.</span>

How can _I_ hold that? This little <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a> will feel overwhelmed. It will feel too much.

The heart veers off into a kind of righteous <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> - _so_ common and so, in a way, normal and easy for that to happen. Instead of staying with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> and the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> in relation to that, we veer off into blame, judgment - either of ourselves or another. Or in the case of ourselves, "I shouldn't be feeling this" - and we judge ourselves just for feeling, for experiencing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. But often we're pointing the finger at someone else and blaming and getting angry, feeling justified in the <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>, and we've moved away from the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>.</span>

##### The blame and the judgement which comes with anger is a seductive movement which misses an understanding

<span class="paragraph">About three or four years ago - I can't remember - I did a couple of months' personal <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. And when I got to the difficult category, I had one person that I knew and two people that I didn't know. So I had a selection, an assortment, of difficult people. And the two people are two politicians - I won't say who they are, but who it seemed to me, you know, a lot of the stuff that was happening in the world and is happening, they had a part in it, put it that way. But then as I began to take them on as part of the difficult person, I started to reflect, or needed to begin to reflect, instead of just "They're terrible," etc., beginning to reflect on the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">causes and conditions</a> that, in a way, brought them into being, enabled them to be, to act, to choose, to be blind in ways that they seem blind. And in one particular politician, in the instance of one of them, just reflecting, "Well, look at his family. Look at his father and the lineage of where, what he came from. What was he educated with?" The whole movement right from day one in his life was to see a certain way, to see the world a certain way, to see others a certain way, to see self a certain way. And was educated that way. And probably through education institutions, etc. And beginning to take it away from self, _his_ self, and see more in terms of the conditions that came together.</span>

Too much <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a> of self and other comes in, and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Near enemy" data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemies</a> come up. We can counter this in practice by contemplating or seeing the commonality. We see the commonality. One's sitting in practice, giving <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> to someone, and we feel a bit above them. Remind oneself of things that are common, human things. ==So instead of looking at the differences - "I don't really do that. I don't suffer like that," how easily that can come in - remind oneself of what's common, the common humanity in that moment.==</span>

And this is a very interesting one. Very easy when we're encountering <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, either our own or others', to be overwhelmed by it, to feel overwhelmed. And when the <a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a> comes up as a <a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a> - which sometimes can be hard to tell the difference - again, it's debilitating.

That tiring, that <a data-href="tiredness" class="internal-link">tiredness</a>, it kind of makes the being, makes the heart, more vulnerable to more <a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a>, which makes the heart _more_ tired.

But there is a kind of, I would say - <a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a> and sweetness in it are marks of <a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a>.

<span class="paragraph">But this <a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a> is something very beautiful, and a very lovely, precious quality of the heart. And we may feel, at times in our life, very drawn to opening this quality of <a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a>. There's something - it's almost like we want to pry open the heart, pry open the being, and we want to take in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the world. I remember I'd just finished a year <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> here some years ago, and was having some time off, actually, before coming back again. And one of things I did was I took a train across Europe, and I went to Auschwitz <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a> camp, extermination camp in fact. And it was sort of a bit of a pilgrimage. It was as if a part of my being wanted ... I felt - it was almost a mystery to me, in part, but a part of my being wanted to go to this place where there had been an _indescribable_ amount of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. I don't actually know the figures; I've forgotten how many million people died there or were killed there. And wanted to be there and just drink it all in.

<span class="paragraph">And actually being there - I don't know, some of you may have been - it's palpable somehow. A lot of the remains of the barracks and the gas chambers, etc., are still there.

<span class="paragraph">**Rob**: How many? 1,000 arms and hands. Why? To reach out, to give. So there's a balance of this **(1) <a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a>**, taking in, and **(2) giving out**. This is so, so important. We can actually address this in our practice. So you might have found today in the practice that you felt - I don't know, it's a question, actually: did you feel at times burdened, or like it was a bit heavy, or overwhelming? Yeah. Very, very common. Extremely common. It doesn't have to be this way. You can play with this. ==Again, you can experiment with this. We feel the <a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a>. We're aware of the <a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a>, what we're taking in. We're tuning into the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. But also we're aware of this - even if we're just imagining it - a <a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a> <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> going out.

<span class="paragraph">Most people will - without even thinking about it, without even realizing it - lean the balance into more <a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a>, into really going into the <a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a>, and not so much into feeling the quality of the <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> coming out: the <a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a> brightness, actually happy <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> of what's coming out. The thing is we can play with that balance in the practice. You can actually play with it as you're sitting there. Be aware of where the balance is, and just incline the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> more towards feeling the lovely <a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a> <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> as it's going out. So you can really play with this. It's not a static balance. In other words, you're not going to find, you know, stick the dial on 5 and leave it there. You'll always be moving, and it's fine to move. And sometimes you're more in the <a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a> - fine. But I would say ==a little bit of balance towards the feeling of the loveliness and the <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> makes <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> enjoyable, sustainable, steady, equanimous, something that we like doing.

<span class="paragraph">So it moves, again, very non-linearly, very gradually. Begin to get glimpses of it, and it's not to make too much of this. We can sometimes get a sense of a <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> that it's not <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> doing it. And it's almost like we open to some bigger sense of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, that ==the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the world is _held -_ held, we could say, in the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> of the universe, in the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> of the universe, in the heart of God, whatever language works. It's almost like something deepens, and the true <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a> of the heart is seen as not limited, but actually infinite and vast.== And it can, it has limitless capacity to hold <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. And so this aspect of holding <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> is very much a part of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> as it deepens. It just comes naturally. And a person might look at this in terms of God or the <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> of a <a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a> - it's all fine; it doesn't actually matter what label you give to it, to an extent. But we find that kind of opening, that kind of <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a> in a lot of different spiritual traditions. <a data-href="Julian of Norwich" class="internal-link">Julian of Norwich</a>, the English Christian mystic: "<a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> is without beginning," she says.

Nicholas Watson and Jacqueline Jenkins, eds., _The Writings of Julian of Norwich: A Vision Showed to a Devout Woman and A Revelation of Love_ (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University, 2006), 197] It's the sense of a whole other, deeper sense of what <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> is, and what <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is.</span>

When we are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> - <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> for self now - when we are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> with whatever it is, it can be really helpful, it can be extremely skilful, whether it's loneliness or the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> hurts or tummy ache, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pain" data-href="Pain" class="internal-link">headache</a>, confusion, <a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a>, sadness, a sense of loss, of <a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a>, whatever the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> is, when there's my <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> and we're feeling it, to realize, to reflect deliberately: "My <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> is actually not different from the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> of others." quote So again, how easy it is for us to compound our own <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> with a sense of isolation. And thinking - sometimes it's not even a conscious thought: =="It's just me that has this. I'm the one that goes through this. No one else has this." Sometimes it's not even a conscious thought, and we're adding, we're stacking on the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> by this isolating of ourselves.==</span>

##### In the realization of the humanity, there's a kind of softening

<span class="paragraph">So it can be - and again, something to play with - you can, when there's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, just step back a little bit and deliberately reflect: "Someone, somewhere, probably even right now, is going through something extremely similar, something very similar if not almost exactly the same." Drop that in as a reflection. Sometimes our <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> - we feel our <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, and we're actually unable to meet it with <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. Partly this isolating of ourselves that we do is blocking the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. So dropping [in] this reflection, again, of the commonality of it, of the non-difference of our own <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, dropping that in, and we open to the humanity of our own <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. This is so crucial. And in that humanity, in the realization of the humanity, there's a kind of softening. And the being just softens. ==Instead of being rigidly, brittlely wrapped up in a kind of self-isolation, a self-definition and separateness, just dropping in the reflection of that commonness, that sharedness, the humanity, allows it to soften. And in the softening, there's an opening, and the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> can begin to flow.== So play with this, play with this.</span>

##### Remind yourself that life is vulnerable
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0204 Compassion (talk) > ^12-2" data-href="0204 Compassion (talk)#^12-2" class="internal-link">12-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (3) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">As we move on to giving <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> to others and we do the friend and benefactor and all that, sometimes we want to give <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> to someone. We look at them. We say, "Well, they don't seem to be <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> much. There's no obvious <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. They seem pretty okay. They're pretty happy." And then one can bring to <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> the vulnerability of life. So we touched on this the other day. ==Just reminding oneself that life is vulnerable - on a physical level, at the emotional level, at a situational level. The uncertainty of life - what a challenge it is!== Even if this person seems like they're doing really okay, it's basically challenging to be human. It's basically challenging to be human. It's not easy. It's not an easy manifestation. It's not an easy territory. So sometimes to reflect on that, if one feels like this person doesn't suffer much, just to lubricate it a little bit, bring the juice in. Also to reflect, "I actually don't know. Even if I know this person well, I may not know really what's going on for them, and what possible <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> there may be there. I don't know. I don't know."</span>

<span class="paragraph">One can also reflect on this <a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a>, and begin to incline the heart and incline the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> towards <a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a>.

It can get sick very easily. ==The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> is vulnerable. We are vulnerable to <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a>. Reflecting, we are one in that. We share that. There's a <a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a> there. We are one in our uncertainty.== Again, we're living in a world where things are uncertain. What happens, what will happen tomorrow, is uncertain. What will happen in the next year, for all of us, is uncertain. It's not certain at all. And probably we all know people whose life can be changed in an instant. Something happens - a piece of news, an accident, this or that - and the life is changed in an instant, dramatically, drastically. We share that. We are one in the vulnerability of that uncertainty.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So contemplating that <a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a>. Final point, and it has to do with this _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>_ and this <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>. We talk about _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>_, the <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> of self.

So I think we've touched on this already. I can't remember. This <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> - where did it come from? I saw a great programme the other night about comets landing on the planet and how life actually was started by the elements that were brought from comets. Was either coming from comets or <a data-href="Big Bang" class="internal-link">Big Bang</a> - not <a data-href="Big Bang" class="internal-link">Big Bang</a>, but some <a data-href="supernova" class="internal-link">supernova</a> of other stars. Now, all this can sound kind of sci-fi, but it's actually science, that ==this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> is coming - the elements in it come from elements that were generated in massive stars, and then those stars exploded and flung out these elements into space. And all the elements that make up our fingernails and our cornea and whatever it is - everyone in this room, the elements that made that were born in the same star. I think it's amazing!== [laughter]</span>

<span class="paragraph">Going back even further, even further, it was all one in the <a data-href="Big Bang" class="internal-link">Big Bang</a>, that the universe was actually tiny, shrunk into this little ball. The whole of space and time was encapsulated there, and it exploded. It was all literally one. Everything that was in the universe was literally one. But - I think I did mention this at some point - the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a> we take, we are permeable with the rest, certainly the earth. We breathe in air. When does it become 'me'? And breathe out. And we share the air with each other and with the trees and with the rest of life, and with the planet. There's this permeability of what I call 'me,' just on a bodily level. And the food - I think, is it <a data-href="Stephen Batchelor" class="internal-link">Stephen Batchelor</a>'s example (can't remember) of eating a banana? It's something very mushy.
