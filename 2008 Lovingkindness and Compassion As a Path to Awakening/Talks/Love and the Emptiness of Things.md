##### Cultivating loving-kindness and compassion brings blessings for self and for other
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things > ^1-1" data-href="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^1-1" class="internal-link">1-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (3) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">Blessing</a> (2) · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11953/20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=00:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">What I want to talk about tonight is [[love]] and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of things</a>. But first, in a way, I want to review some of the salient features of what we've been doing so far. So at a very basic level, of course, we've been, we _are_ cultivating _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, cultivating <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, and cultivating [[compassion]]. And I don't think that I need to persuade anyone of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Blessing" data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">blessings</a> of that at this point on the [[retreat]]. And so we see, through the [[cultivation]], the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Blessing" data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">blessings</a> of doing this that come for self and for other. And if it's not clear yet what comes out towards other, it does get clear as we move into our life, our usual life.</span>

##### Planting the seeds of intention to recondition the mind
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things > ^1-2" data-href="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Reconditioning" class="internal-link">Reconditioning</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">Habit</a> · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11953/20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=01:14" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So to repeat the analogy that I've used many times, we're planting these seeds, planting the seeds of intention. And ==we're [[reconditioning]] the heart and the [[mind]], which essentially, you could say, is a whirlpool, a web of conditioning, of conditions and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a> of conditions.== And we're [[reconditioning]] it slowly, patiently, gradually, and in that, through that, transforming the heart, transforming our intentions, so that the way we act in the world, what comes out of our mouth, our thoughts, all of that, is gradually, slowly transformed. Remember the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s words: =="Drop by drop the bucket is filled."==^[Dhp 122] That's a very basic level of what we're doing.</span>

##### We are nurturing the best possible climate for our growth
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things > ^1-3" data-href="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (3) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11953/20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=02:17" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Another aspect, or rather part of that, is that ==through cultivating <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and [[compassion]], we're also nurturing and establishing the best possible climate for our growth: so psychological, emotional, spiritual growth.== It's the best possible climate. And I know, if I reflect back on my past, trying at times to work very hard on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> myself or on transforming myself, and yet not holding that process, not holding myself in that process in a climate of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>. I was barely aware of it at the time. And what happens? Just running into a brick wall. Or it backfires in some way. And maybe there's some transformation. But the fullness of that will not be available. And so whatever growth we're talking about - meditative, spiritual, however - the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and [[compassion]] are the best possible climate.</span>

##### Two wings for the path: wholesome nourishment and investigation for insight
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things > ^1-4" data-href="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> (2) · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">Kusala</a> (5) · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> (5) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Generosity" class="internal-link">Generosity</a> · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11953/20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=03:26" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">When the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> described his path, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a> that he set forth, it's interesting - he didn't teach that much about technique and [[meditation]] technique. There's a little bit, but it's not generally that common. Rather, what he does over and over is encourage us to strive for two things, to work to develop two things. **(1)** One is a **<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a>**, a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> sense of the being, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, the [[mind]], the heart, being nourished. And '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a>' meaning ways that don't lead to our harm or the harm of others. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">Wholesome</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a> - so what's in that? It's all these qualities: <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, [[compassion]], [[generosity]], [[equanimity]], etc., [[mindfulness]]. And developing these qualities that give the being a really deep, really satisfying grounding in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a>. It's like there's a reservoir inside. Slowly, slowly, there's a reservoir inside. And that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a> is one aspect of what he encouraged. **(2)** And the other aspect is **investigation for [[insight]]**. And these two kind of wings of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>: developing what's beautiful for the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a>, and then the investigation.</span>

##### Wholesome nourishment through metta and samadhi
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things > ^1-5" data-href="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^1-5" class="internal-link">1-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">Kusala</a> (2) · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> (2) · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (2) · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11953/20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=04:54" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So, in a way, the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ is, again, part of that very deep <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a>. And the more we have of that, in a way, the freer we are in life. We are less dependent on others, less dependent on circumstances. We have enough. We have enough, and it's not cold. It's not uncaring or isolationist. It's just that we have enough, and it can flow over. Part of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a> is _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_. So for me - I don't know how it seems for you - it seems like a long time ago that I spoke about _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_. But I was hoping, talking about it at the beginning, that it would be something that we would keep in our minds, in the sort of back of our [[awareness]] for the whole [[retreat]]. And it's interesting: we come here for three weeks or longer, or whatever it is, and a lot of stuff happens. A lot of stuff happens in our [[experience]]. We go through a lot of stuff. There are a lot of aspects to what we're doing. We talk about [[love]] and [[compassion]] - there are a lot of aspects to that.</span>

##### Questioning
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things > ^2-1" data-href="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Pity" class="internal-link">Pity</a> · <a data-href="Feelings" class="internal-link">Feelings</a> (3)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11953/20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=06:06" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">One aspect, and I've talked on this, is questioning. So we question: "What is [[compassion]], actually, when I really look at it? How is that different from, say, [[pity]] or whatever else? What is my attitude towards that? What blocks it?", etc. So there's a real questioning going on. That's very much a part of what's going on. And at times, as you all know, things come up for us. We find ourself in difficult territory, old [[feelings]] come up, or just [[feelings]] in the moment come up. We're struggling. Or it's just something charged, not even that much struggle. That, too, is part of the process. ==So there's the questioning. There is allowing ourselves to feel what needs to be felt at times, feeling the feelings.==</span>

---
##### Encouragement
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things > ^2-2" data-href="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (2) · <a data-href="Feelings" class="internal-link">Feelings</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11953/20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=06:53" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">_And_ there's the encouragement, the nurturing, of the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, which is actually a quietening of the questioning and a quietening of the turbulence of [[feelings]], which sometimes seem like they really _demand_ to be felt, _demand_ to be looked at. So all that somehow needs to fit into the picture of what we're doing. ==Sometimes we're more questioning, sometimes we're more allowing what needs to bubble up, and sometimes we're just developing the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ and letting things get quiet, developing that journey into the depth, into the stillness, into the subtlety.==</span>

##### Samadhi is one of the factors that allows the love and compassion to come into the cells
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things > ^2-3" data-href="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (3) · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">Habit</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11953/20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=07:35" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Now what I see - and this is kind of reviewing a bit what I said about _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ - is that most people that I come across in [[meditation]] circles tend not to give as much emphasis or believe as much in the importance of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ as perhaps they should. It's almost like we don't quite trust that or give it as much weight. And so partly - I'm just refreshing - that's definitely a factor here for the depth and the depth of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>, the depth of opening, the depth of transformation, as I said. _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a>_ is one of the factors. It's just one. So all the others are important. But it's one of the factors that allows the [[love]] and the [[compassion]] to kind of come into the cells. Something very visceral almost about it, very deep. But again, they're all important. All those aspects are important. To know what one's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">tendencies</a> are. Is my tendency to avoid? What is it?</span>

<span class="paragraph">So there's this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a> and [[insight]], and we're kind of developing both in a lifetime of practice. With the [[cultivation]] of qualities that bring <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a> (one of which is _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, and [[compassion]], etc.), very important to see that it's not about self-improvement. And how easily the judging [[mind]] comes in, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind" data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">measuring mind</a> comes in: "How am I doing?" And particularly with concepts like _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ or _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ or [[compassion]], whatever it is: "I have it. I don't have it. How am I in relation to others?" ==So it's really not about self-improvement, and the whole notion of a self to improve begins to just loosen in time with practice. And yet, we can still be really committed to this process of [[cultivation]], of developing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a>, of reconditioning.== And yet there's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">no self</a> at the [[centre]] of it. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">No self</a> at the [[centre]] of it, and yet we're totally committed.</span>

##### "Reconditioning" might be a dry word, but it's an important part of what's going on

<span class="paragraph">So this [[reconditioning]] is - it sounds such a mechanical and dry word, but it's actually a very important part of what's going on, as I said. I remember - it was a couple of years ago. I taught a day [[retreat]] on [[compassion]] in London. And in the question and answer period, a gentleman stopped me. Well, he didn't really - he asked a question. And he said, "Conditioning, conditioning, conditioning!" [laughs] He said, "All this conditioning - isn't it just going round in the circles of what's conditioned? How are you going to move, how is the [[mind]] going to move towards what's Unconditioned? And the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> talks about what's Unconditioned as the goal of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>. Aren't you just playing endlessly, fiddling with conditions?" [laughter]</span>

##### Recondition (i.e. working on a relative level) brings well-being and sets up conditions that lead to the Unconditioned
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things > ^3-1" data-href="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^3-1" class="internal-link">3-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Reconditioning" class="internal-link">Reconditioning</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (3) · <a data-href="Image" class="internal-link">Image</a> · <a data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">Habit</a> · <a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a> · <a data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">Pleasantness</a> · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> · <a data-href="Conventional reality" class="internal-link">Conventional reality</a> · <a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">I think he was coming from a genuine, caring place. [laughter] I'm actually not sure to this day. But there is, first of all, the importance of just that relative level, of just [[reconditioning]] the [[mind]], as I said. At one level the [[mind]], you could say - again, it's not a very glamorous [[image]], but the [[mind]] is a web, a mass, a vortex, a spaghetti bowl of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a>, of conditioning. And we _can_ begin to recondition that. Tremendous amount of [[freedom]], <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a>, peace, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, etc., come out of that, just at <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conventional reality" data-href="Conventional reality" class="internal-link">the relative</a> level. And that's absolutely fine and actually crucial. _And_ there is the conditioning, the setting up of conditions, the nurturing of conditions that actually leads to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a>. And actually in its deepening, and in its unfoldment, leads towards <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a>, what is not conditioned, what is not born of conditions, what is not a condition. That's partly to do with what I'm going to talk about in this talk. I'll come back to that.</span>

##### This practice softens the boundaries of the self

<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11953/20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=12:05" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So this is all still review, but last point. As we do _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ and [[compassion]] practice - and many of you will have felt this to some degree, to any degree, any degree is good - that the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a> can soften at times. And the actual self and the walls of [[the self]], the boundaries of [[the self]] begin to soften, begin to be more open, more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a>, more permeable, in a way. And this is hugely important because we get a glimpse of living without this self-[[constriction]], living without binding ourselves and defining ourselves and wrapping us up, wrapping ourselves up so much in [[the self]]. We begin to get a sense of perhaps [[oneness]], or a flavour of this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a>, this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">no-self</a>, this _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>_. And so <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and [[compassion]] just lead naturally to a less fixed, less rigid, less tightly bound <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a> _at times_. At times it moves that way. And something in that opening, in that softening, begins to shake up and awaken some <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> about [[the self]] and the [[nature]] of [[the self]]. And again, giving [[compassion]] and [[love]] to oneself - it's not building up the ego. It's not building up the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a>. And to explore this in our lives and in our practice - the way the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a> gets built up, the way the ego gets built up, is through a _problematic_ relationship with [[the self]], a judgmental, a critical, a harsh relationship with [[the self]], a rigidly defined relationship with [[the self]]. Problematic <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a> builds up the ego. And when we have _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ towards our self, [[compassion]] towards our self, that actually begins to soften. So there's an easing of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a> - at times, at times - with these practices.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Okay, so far, so good, I hope! All _that_ is in the realm of what we could call traditionally understood practices of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and [[compassion]].

It says, 'See all _things_ with the eyes of [[compassion]].'" What could that mean? Does it mean to regard the microphone with [[compassion]]?

##### In the Mahayana traditions, "compassion" includes loving-kindness

<span class="paragraph">So a couple of words, translations: first of all, '[[compassion]]' and '[[love]],' in a lot of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahayana" data-href="Mahayana" class="internal-link">Mahāyāna</a> traditions, they use it interchangeably.

Here they've done the same thing but with '[[love]].' Less rigidly different, the terms. So both of those statements, the _Lotus Sūtra_, "See all _things_ with the eyes of [[compassion]]" - it means with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a> and [[compassion]].</span>

<span class="paragraph">And what is a _[[dharma]]_? What does this mean - "[[love]] is based on _dharmas_, directed to _dharmas_"? A _[[dharma]]_ has a lot of different meanings in the teachings. And one of them just kind of means 'things.' It just means 'things,' but it means 'things' as experiences or objects of [[awareness]]. So some _thing_ arising in [[awareness]] is a _[[dharma]]_. So whatever that is - a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> sensation, a thought, an intention, a mood, a [[mind state]], a moment of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, whatever it is, [[compassion]] - they're all _dharmas_.

<span class="paragraph">Now, on one level, at first, this doesn't make any sense logically, and "What on earth is it talking about?" But we saw with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditation</a> this morning, and you've been practising today. Just to review that a little bit. ==We can, in our practice, direct this stream, at times, when we feel a stream of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and [[compassion]], actually direct it towards [[experience]], whatever the [[experience]] is, and actually bathe that [[experience]] in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and [[compassion]], _or_ [[compassion]], or both, or a mixture, or whatever it is. We can _hold_ it in [[compassion]], _hold_ it in [[love]], or _let_ it be held in that water of love.== If you're just talking about the techniques now and the ways to experiment with it, we can use the phrases or just a word in the phrases, if that feels helpful. You can experiment with this mode of opening the door of [[awareness]], opening the door of [[consciousness]], and totally, totally welcoming, just opening it up so it can be there.</span>

##### Emphasizing acceptance, not so much precision and clarity
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things > ^5-3" data-href="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^5-3" class="internal-link">5-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (3) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Acceptance" class="internal-link">Acceptance</a> (3) · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> (3) · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11953/20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=20:29" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So emphasizing the [[love]], emphasizing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and [[compassion]], emphasizing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and the [[compassion]] and the _[[acceptance]],_ and not so much emphasizing the precise clarity of noticing or noting or seeing exactly what's going on. Oftentimes, when we talk about [[mindfulness]] and we practise [[mindfulness]], that's what gets emphasized, is the clarity of what's going on, the clarity of seeing what's going on, the precision of seeing. So it's a different approach when one's _really_ emphasizing the [[acceptance]], which also is talked about as part of [[mindfulness]]. But really leaning towards emphasizing the [[acceptance]] aspect, the [[love]] aspect. Emphasizing a total welcoming, as long as it's genuine. ==One works in the practice to make it completely genuine, really, really welcoming this [[experience]] so that the arising of any [[experience]] is completely welcomed, completely held in that love.==</span>

---
<span class="paragraph">**Yogi 2**: Does that include the discriminating aspects? You know, when you start discriminating automatically between kind of good and bad, or the [[feelings]], you know, the [[emotions]] around the [[experience]] - the discriminating [[mind]] sets in automatically sometimes.</span>
<span class="paragraph">**Rob**: I'm not quite sure what you mean, Will. Can you save it for the end? Because it sounds important. Is that okay? Because we'll have questions afterwards. I think there's something important there, but can we save it? Is that all right?</span>

##### Arising, staying, passing - held in love, or direct that intentionality
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things > ^5-6" data-href="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^5-6" class="internal-link">5-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">Phenomenon</a> · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (2) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11953/20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=22:17" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">The arising of all experiences, the staying - so an [[experience]] of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a>, a _[[dharma]]_ stays in [[consciousness]] for a while, short or long - and it passes. And so the arising is held in [[love]], is bathed in [[love]], is completely welcomed. The staying and the passing - completely held and bathed in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>. So as I said, there are a few different, _slight_ different emphases of approach even within what we just said. One can work in a more _directing_ way - so this is what came up this morning - can _direct_ that stream when one feels it, _direct_ that intentionality. Or it can be much more holding and much more of a kind of relaxing into a space that's imbued or shot through with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>. Much more receptive mode. One can be directing or receptive. It's fine.</span>

##### Whatever is going on, the attitude of acceptence can always just expand a little and include whatever it is

<span class="paragraph">At times, of course, what's going to come up is resistance or no feeling or whatever. But there's something about this. It's almost like, whatever's going on, the attitude of [[acceptance]] and welcoming can always just expand a little bit and include whatever it is. Any resistance, any "I hate this, I hate ... _da-da-da-da-da_," whatever it is, just expands, so - "That's okay. Welcome, welcome, welcome." So in a way, there's nothing outside the domain, outside the range, of this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, this [[compassion]]. ==Nothing is outside it. Whatever's going on can actually be welcomed and included.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">In a way, for some people, a way in is, when we look inside, and what we encounter when we look inside is just a _stream_, so to speak, or an endless cornucopia, an endless arising and passing of [[experience]]. It's just, whatever arises, it just passes. Whatever arises, it just passes. ==Everything is so fleeting. And so things, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a>, _dharmas_ are fleeting by their [[nature]], when we look at them. And in a way, you could say, they're deserving of [[compassion]]. They're impoverished. They barely last.== You know? So question: what happens to [[feelings]] when we do this, when we bathe them in [[love]], when we totally welcome, when we hold them in that? What happens to the [[feelings]]? What happens to mental states?</span>

It's a practice that one can develop, and that's really important to see. But it can be, as it's been said, that things, _dharmas_, experiences, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a>, may soften. They soften. The [[experience]] of them actually softens. They begin, can begin to lose their edges. They can begin to lose their definition, to blur. Even, as Jeanette said, they can dissolve, or they can <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a>, either a little bit, or a lot, or completely.

##### In mindfulness practice, the assumption is often that mindfulness is neutral - "things as they are"

<span class="paragraph">But let's explore this a little more. In [[mindfulness]] practice, there's actually an assumption there, quite a big one and often a subconscious one, one that we're not quite fully aware of. Or maybe we're actually saying it out loud. The assumption is that [[mindfulness]] is something neutral. The assumption is that there's something called [[mindfulness]] that - this came up in a question and answer period a week or more than a week ago. The assumption is that there's something called '[[mindfulness]],' that what it can do is attend to things and see things in their naked actuality, something called '[[mindfulness]]' which doesn't interfere in any way, and it's just seeing 'things as they are' - that phrase, 'things as they are,' which is a very well-worn phrase in the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, 'things as they are.' And the assumption is that [[mindfulness]], [[letting go]] of the story, [[letting go]] of my likes, dislikes, and all that, coming close to things, I'll see the bare actuality of what the thing _is_. Or I will see, be in touch with what _is_. And sometimes, even, as I say, more problematically, we can come to take as a view of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>, as a view of the goal, that the goal of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a> is 'being with things as they are,' 'being with what is.' ==And these become very charged concepts: 'what is,' 'things as they are.' But again, that's never, never, never the goal of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>. It's a beautiful way of practising. It's a beautiful way of being - _cannot_ be the goal of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>. The goal of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a> is an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>, a very deep <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>, that brings [[freedom]] with it. It brings [[freedom]]. It's something gone beyond this 'what is' and these notions.== I'm going to fill that out.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Now, let's explore this a little bit. It has to do with the [[nature]] of [[perception]]. And if we just step back and look at how [[perception]] works in our life, we have, all of us, had the [[experience]] of feeling angry in some situation. And anyone who wants to kind of grow up and mature psychologically has to admit that ==[[anger]] _colours_ the [[perception]] at times. And we even have a phrase in English: one is 'seeing red.' I was seeing red, or he's seeing red; she's seeing red. The very words are implying this colouring of [[perception]]. One's looking at the world, at the situation in that moment, through the lenses of [[anger]]. And the [[perception]] is correspondingly changed - of a person, of ourselves, of a situation.== And (some of you may have tasted this on the [[retreat]]) other extreme: when the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ feels like it's going very well, there's a softness, there's [[compassion]], and one walks outside. And one's just having a cup of tea or whatever it is, and the _[[beauty]]_ - one feels there's a tranquillity there. It's almost that one is in a deva realm, in a heavenly realm - you know, obviously, just a short period of time. But it's something that can arise.</span>

<span class="paragraph">When there's a lot of [[love]] around, how does the [[perception]] change? When there's a lot of [[anger]] around, how does the [[perception]] change? When we are angry with another - and I've probably said this at some point in the [[retreat]] - typically when we're doing _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice, we think, "Oh, I'm angry at him or her. I should give _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ to them because, you know, [[anger]]'s bad, and I should kind of wish them _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ instead." Can be really skilful. What happens when, instead of immediately going to give the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ to the other person that we're angry at, we give the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ towards our self?

##### There is always some degree of love or aversion in the mind

<span class="paragraph">So, we could say we have a continuum of - at one end, murderous, homicidal rage. [laughs] And on the other end, beautiful [[love]], beautiful <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and [[compassion]], and the softness and the openness of that. The [[mind]] is _always_ - there's always some degree of [[love]] or [[anger]], moving towards an object or away from an object, pushing, pulling. There's always some degree of [[love]] or [[aversion]] in the [[mind]]. There's always some degree. So even with [[mindfulness]], we tend to think, again, there's just this pure thing called '[[mindfulness]].' But any moment of [[consciousness]] has some degree of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a> at [[experience]], wanting to move towards it, pushing it away, [[aversion]], [[love]].

<span class="paragraph">**Rob**: Yeah, I'm going to explain. It's good! It's great! [laughter] So there's this spectrum. There's this spectrum, and any moment of [[consciousness]] from, as I said, complete rage to bliss of loving infinitely all beings, etc. - there's a range. Any moment of [[consciousness]] can be placed somewhere on that spectrum, somewhere on that continuum.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Which point on that continuum reveals the real object, the real way things are?

Human beings - actually _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Consciousness" data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousnesses</a>_, slugs, sheep, human beings, all of them - believe in real objects. Now, this is where this becomes very interesting. We can say, "No, it's all relative," and everything, and that's beautiful, and [[insight]] is being born. And sometimes, though, even if we say that intellectually, we still believe at some level in real objects, internal and external. But as people have said, in a way, there is no real thing. There is no neutral point. There is no real object. There is no object independent.</span>

##### The presence of love and equanimity makes objects less prominent in consciousness
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things > ^8-12" data-href="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^8-12" class="internal-link">8-12</a>**: _<a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> (6) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Pain" class="internal-link">Pain</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Now, someone _could_ say, "Okay, well, if it's not [[mindfulness]], then maybe it's that thing, [[equanimity]]. I've heard about [[equanimity]]." And the word '[[equanimity]]' sounds, you know, _equal_ + _imity_ - whatever _imity_ is. [laughter] Somewhere in the middle, and maybe that's the neutral point, right there. But again, someone practising [[equanimity]] practice deeply would notice the same thing - that as the [[equanimity]] deepens, objects are changed. There's a change of objects. So [[love]] and [[equanimity]] - the result of their presence, the result of them being in the heart, in the [[mind]], is that objects make less impression in [[consciousness]]. They're less prominent in [[consciousness]]. And we can see this in the practice - sitting, walking, on the cushion. Certainly, as some of you have found out, when there's a [[pain]], what happens when we do that? What happens when we do that? When there's an emotion, what happens when we bathe it in [[love]]?</span>

<span class="paragraph">And of course, one can see it off the cushion, outside of the [[meditation]] hall. So there's a situation that _really_ seems important or is troubling us a lot. And when there's a lot of [[love]], or when there's a lot of [[equanimity]], it barely impacts. Or its importance just doesn't - it doesn't seem so crucial, so pressing. Or the actual fact of it barely imprints on [[consciousness]].</span>

<span class="paragraph">There's a lot here. There's a tremendous amount here. On one level, what can be discovered here is what the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> might call 'skilful means for easeful abiding,' for <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> abiding, skilful means to develop ease in life, in a situation. So this is one approach to when there's something difficult: being at ease with that. This is so important. Again, going back to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> abiding - do we know, are we developing in our life, these skills to be able to be at ease more and more? How profoundly important that is to our life, to our whole sense of the quality of life and the ease of our life. Are we skilled? Are we interested in developing that skill of easeful abiding, of having ease? Even when something difficult is going on - one has an illness or there's a difficult situation, or whatever it is - there's the possibility for ease with that. So, skilful means for ease. But also, there are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a> here, and they're extremely important and profound.</span>

##### Relationships with dharmas are either of love and peace, or of struggle

<span class="paragraph">So the first one is that it's the relationship that is important. It's the relationship with what the [[experience]] is; it's the relationship with any object that's important. Oftentimes in [[insight]] practice or <a data-href="Zen" class="internal-link">Zen</a> practice or whatever it is, we're giving [[attention]] to objects, giving [[attention]] to [[experience]] - and understandably; that's kind of what we're told to do. But sometimes we're so kind of transfixed with what's going on, with the object going on, we're giving it so much [[attention]] that we don't see what's around that [[attention]], the relationship that we have with the object. Sometimes we don't even realize what that relationship is. Putting it very crudely, you _could_ say, relationship with objects - _dharmas_, [[experience]], <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a> - [[relationships]] are basically either a relationship of peace or a relationship of struggle: trying to hang on, trying to get rid of, whatever. So it's either a relationship of peace or a relationship of struggle. When there's _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, [[love]] and [[compassion]], in that relationship with whatever's going on - [[love]] is peace. <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> is a relationship of peace. To have that relationship of [[love]] is to have a relationship of peace, basically.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And we can see. We can see that when the relationship is non-struggling with what's difficult, it's non-struggling, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> goes out of [[experience]]. ==The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> goes out of [[experience]] to the degree that we can soften our struggle with it. To the degree that [[love]] comes into that relationship, that peace comes into that relationship, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> goes out of experience.== This is so crucial. And again, when we struggle with something, we tend to think, "I have this problem," or "This thing going on in my life or this thing going on in my [[consciousness]] _is_ a problem." To practise this way and to see, inherently, it cannot be a problem. It cannot. In <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> language we say it's _empty_ of problem. The problem is empty. ==The problem is something _we_ bring into it through our relationship with it. In itself, any [[experience]] is empty of problem. It's so important, that level of [[insight]]. So absolutely crucial. And you can - even as I say it, you get a sense of the immense kind of both potential and responsibility that gives to consciousness.== Immense.

<span class="paragraph">So in a way, we talk about things and objects and [[experience]]. The truth of them, in a way, is not that they exist, really, or that they don't exist.

<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things > ^10-6" data-href="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^10-6" class="internal-link">10-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> (3) · <a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a> · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So as I said, we can see this in formal <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation practice</a> - sitting, walking, etc. You can also see it in one's life or in more complex situations. For example, take a situation like a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">meditation retreat</a>. And one comes, and one comes on _this_ [[retreat]]. Come to <a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a>, three weeks of [[retreat]], and you think, "Great! I'm really going to work on my _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ and get really quiet and calm," and then one comes into the hall, and it's pretty packed in here, and someone's shuffling next to you or coughing or whatever it is, and irritation arises. And the whole view of the situation, of that person, is seen through the lens of irritation. We've come into the situation with the agenda of 'what I want,' and that's colouring everything. And then the view, the [[perception]], changes.</span>

##### Play with different perceptions of the situation

<span class="paragraph">We can play with this. The [[beauty]] of practice is that you can play with all this and experiment with it. Could I change that view in a situation like this or some other [[retreat]]? And this person is restless, or whatever it is - could I view that situation, then, as an opportunity to learn patience? Then every time there's some disturbance, it's an opportunity to learn patience. And the whole view has changed. Or if you're super advanced, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vajrayana" data-href="Vajrayana" class="internal-link">Vajrayāna</a> ... [laughs] You sit there and forget the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, forget everything: "My whole purpose of being here is to [[love]] you, just you." [laughs] Play with it. What happens? ==The view changes and the [[perception]] changes. The [[perception]] we have of things is dependent on the view, of how we're seeing.==</span>

##### With fear, the object and the fear are not independent
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things > ^11-2" data-href="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^11-2" class="internal-link">11-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (9) · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> · <a data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">Perception</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11953/20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=49:15" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So I was speaking about [[fear]] some talks ago, and can draw this into that area as well. And [[fear]] is a very interesting one because it can be quite clear with [[fear]]. We tend to think, we tend to feel, we tend to believe that there's some thing or event going on or about to go on or will go on in the future, and then I have [[fear]] about that. I'm afraid of that. And somehow in there is the assumption that the thing and the event and the situation and the [[fear]] are separate, they're separate, and that they're independent. There's, again, an object, any object, and there's how I might relate to it. And I could relate with [[fear]] or with [[equanimity]] or whatever it is, but the object is still the object no matter how I relate to it. And begin to get the sense that that's not really the case. Now, with [[fear]], to a degree, at least intellectually, it's obvious. We can see how [[fear]] colours our [[perception]]. ==You know, you're afraid walking at night in the dark, and you see the shadows, and it looks like, you know, a big ... [laughter] And it's not. It's just the shadows coloured with the [[perception]] from the fear.==</span>

##### Being fearful of doing something is still a situation you're viewing

<span class="paragraph">**Yogi 9**: How does that relate to doing? You know, because doing is not an object. So you're fearful of doing something, a performance, maybe, or exercising a skill, but there's a [[fear]] around your performance.</span>

---
<span class="paragraph">**Rob**: It's still a situation that you're viewing. You're viewing how it will be in that situation to do it or not do it well.</span>
<span class="paragraph">**Yogi 9**: It just doesn't come across as an object. It's kind of neutral, if you like, or it's only what you put on it.</span>
<span class="paragraph">**Rob**: Well, put it this way: your doing of something is - if there was nothing charged about your doing and how well you performed something, there wouldn't be any [[fear]] there, and you would see that doing in a different way. It would become different through the way you're seeing it.</span>
<span class="paragraph">**Yogi 9**: So you charge it yourself?</span>

<span class="paragraph">**Rob**: Absolutely. When I say 'object,' I mean in the broadest possible sense of the word 'object.' So that whole situation is a so-called object or thing or event, situation.</span>

##### A lot of fear is future-thinking based

<span class="paragraph">And when I talked about [[fear]] before, I mentioned that a lot of [[fear]] is caught up with [[future thinking]]. We're often afraid of something in the future, and the thinking around it is something in the future. Even if it's next few seconds or a long time in the future, whatever, it's future-thinking based. ==If I believe in 'the present,' if I believe in a [[present moment]], a present situation, as something that has real, independent existence - if I believe in the present, then [[fear]] of the future is inevitable. It's just waiting to happen.== And to use the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s analogy, "as sure as the wheels of the cart follow the ox that pulls it," if I believe in the inherent existence of the present, [[fear]] of the future will come.^[Dhp 1] There will be [[fear]] of the future. But we can see, through these practices and others, that the present lacks inherent existence. It's not independent. The past, too, is not independent.</span>

##### Example: thinking back on romances of one's past life, or high school

<span class="paragraph">So I can think back on - you know, one thinks back on romances of one's past life. [laughs] Depending on one's mood, you know, it's like, "Ah, she/he/they were lovely, and wasn't that sweet?" [laughs] And in another mood, you think back, and you think, "Yikes! What was I thinking!" [laughter] Or you know, if I think back to my education, my school, my high school, and sometimes I think back, and it was a very pressured environment academically, and a lot of cruelty - I went to boys' school - a lot of, yeah, cruelty. And sometimes I look back in another mood, and I think, "Yeah, we really had a laugh. That was really fun. That was really ..." You know. ==The present is not independent; the past is also not independent. They depend on the [[mind state]] in the present. The future is the same. The future is the same. The future is only going to become present and past. It's dependent. It's not independent. It's empty. When I begin to see this, it's like, I don't really believe in the present; you can't really believe in the future. And if you can't really believe in the future, [[fear]] has no footing.== It has no footing. I can't really believe in [[fear]].</span>

##### Love without an object, that's the best love of all
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things > ^12-2" data-href="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^12-2" class="internal-link">12-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Aksayamati Sutra" class="internal-link">Aksayamati Sutra</a> · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> · <a data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">Unfabricated</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (6) · <a data-href="Rumi" class="internal-link">Rumi</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">If we go back to that _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aksayamati Sutra" data-href="Aksayamati Sutra" class="internal-link">Akṣayamati Sūtra</a>_, and talked about three sort of levels, and in the third level it said, "for those who have seen deeply into [[emptiness]]," or seen <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a> or whatever, "[[love]] is not based on anything at all." And just to briefly explore this. It appears in other traditions as well, and other sources. The Sufi poet <a data-href="Rumi" class="internal-link">Rumi</a> has a lovely poem which I read once and have since misplaced or cannot find again. But he talks about, or a couple of lines in it, [[love]] without an object - [[love]] without an object, not based on anything at all. It's not even [[love]] towards all beings or all things; it's actually without an object. And again, the [[mind]] can just be, like, baffled by that. He says, "<a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> without an object," and I think the next line is, "That's the best [[love]] of all."</span>

##### Compassion without any object of reference, that's the best of all paths

<span class="paragraph">In some of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tibetan Buddhism" data-href="Tibetan Buddhism" class="internal-link">Tibetan traditions</a>, in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vajrayana" data-href="Vajrayana" class="internal-link">Vajrayāna</a>, they also talk about [[compassion]] without any object of reference - same thing - [[compassion]] without any object of reference. And it's also said that that's the best of all paths, without any potential pitfalls in it. So just to mention that as a possibility, as something ... oftentimes coming - when one goes deep into [[emptiness]], or there's that kind of opening, one can begin sometimes to get a glimpse of this.</span>

<span class="paragraph">In a way, actually, I want to just drop something in here which I may have said before, but I think it's pertinent. I think it's important, when one's listening to teachings and such, to notice one's reaction to what's being said. So often I was talking about this [[love]] without an object and very sort of deep teachings or high teachings or whatever. And just interesting to notice what goes on for us when we hear that. There's a whole range of reactions that are possible. Some people hear something like that - and I see this quite a lot - and just turn off, just turn off. Something just shuts down - can't hear it, don't want to hear it. Or you know, I see people picking at their nails and stuff. [laughter] Something goes on - don't want to know, can't handle it. Or we may get _really_ excited. And there's a [[beauty]] of that; there's a [[beauty]] of <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> excitement. But sometimes we get so excited that we think, "Where I am now is completely irrelevant and not worth anything. _That's_ where I want to go." Or a kind of intense striving can come into practice. I think it's just important to see where this is landing in the moment, in oneself. And just to notice that. And of course, it can land in a very lovely place of just simple aspiration. But there's a range there, and it differs at different times, and just to see.</span>

##### Tanha vs chanda

<span class="paragraph">The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> talked about two movements of [[mind]], two energies: _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">taṇhā</a>_, which literally translates as 'thirst' - this never ... unfulfillable, endless wanting, wanting, wanting, [[craving]]. And another [[energy]] called _[[chanda]]_, which - they're both kind of '[[desire]].' You could translate them both as '[[desire]].' But ==_[[chanda]]_ is more 'aspiration,' 'will to do.' It's actually the fuel for our practice. And where do teachings land? Does _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">taṇhā</a>_ grab hold of them and make a problem out of it? Or does _chanda_?== Do they land in _[[chanda]]_? And so, there is really a place for healthy, noble, beautiful aspiration in our practice. And we can hear stuff, and it lands in a good place. I think it just needs some [[awareness]], just to notice what goes on. And I don't know where it's from, but ==the [[image]] of walking, wanting to climb a mountain. And there's the mountain in the distance, and one wants to get to the mountain peak, and one has one's vision set on that, but also just the footstep in front of one. And one holds both. And there's a sensitive balance there that's important.==</span>

##### In its depth, the nature of love is non-grasping

I want to say more about that. So things can dissolve to some degree, or completely, or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a> to some degree, or completely, when we do this, when we let go of - or when we hold them in [[love]]. Why? What's going on there? Why is that? <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> - [[love]] or [[compassion]], whatever word - [[love]], like [[equanimity]], it shares something with [[equanimity]]. We can talk about a kind of continuum of [[love]] or deepening of [[love]], but in its depths, in the depths of [[love]], it shares something with the quality of [[equanimity]]. And that is, in its depth, it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a>. So it's very different then from the typical Hollywood scenario of [[love]]; we've moved quite a way since that. And in its depths, the [[nature]] of [[love]] is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a>. Like [[equanimity]], it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a>. And we see - again to reiterate, there are a couple of things here. We see that - John talked about [[dependent origination]], so he probably talked about that link between [[clinging]] and [[craving]] and then the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> that comes out of that. And that's one link. Did he talk about this? That's one link that's very available to our scrutiny and experimentation. ==We can actually learn to relax the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a> and see the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> go out. It doesn't feed <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> and [[love]], in their depths, are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a> - there isn't a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a> or a pulling towards.== <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Non-grasping</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**Rob**: [laughs] I think ... Well, first of all, to see it in one's [[experience]], that with this kind of practice, when one's emphasizing this approach, ==the more welcoming there is, basically the less [[aversion]], the less <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a> and pulling towards (we say "less <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">pushing and pulling</a>"; that's less <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a>), and what we notice is that the world, the world of [[experience]], appears less. And if there's really very little <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a>, it can be that very little appears at all. It just kind of dissolves, dissolves, dissolves. So it's really to see that. And to conclude from that, there's something about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a> that's actually building [[experience]]. I don't know that one can explain it any more than that.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">**Rob**: But the seeing of it is absolutely crucial. I mean, if we talk about - what does it mean?

##### Dependent origination is a conceptual framework which dissolves itself

<span class="paragraph">So [[dependent origination]] is a map, a conceptual map that eats [itself], like a snake eating its own tail, a [[conceptual framework]] that leads to the dissolving of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a>. It's pretty far out. [laughter] Not easy to understand, so I really know that I'm not talking about stuff that's easy to understand. But we _can_ begin to see this. This is the amazing thing: we _can_ begin to see this. And when one sees it, the more one sees it, the implications are totally radical. It turns our basic intuitions about life and [[experience]] inside out, upside down, on their head. That's how radical the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> is. And begin to see, there is no _thing_. There is no thing independent, independently existing, no separate thing. ==No thing, no problem! The problems that I make in life are dependent on me relating to things as separate things.==</span>

##### When there's grasping we are blurring our vision
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things > ^14-4" data-href="0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^14-4" class="internal-link">14-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a> (5) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (3) · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> · <a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a> · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> · <a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a> (4)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So we also see that as we let go of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a>, we notice that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a> is also a factor which clouds our seeing. When there's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a>, we're blurring our vision. We're covering up our vision. We're distorting our vision through that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a>. So, [[love]] and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">non-grasping</a> also lead, bring with them, a seeing more deeply, more clearly. In <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> terms, what does it mean to see more deeply and more clearly? It means to see things like [[impermanence]] and this very [[emptiness]], to see that more clearly. That's what it means. And out of that seeing more clearly comes [[freedom]] and actually comes even more [[love]]. And the whole thing builds [[freedom]], and builds - or rather, it opens [[freedom]]. It allows [[freedom]] and [[love]].</span>

##### Emptiness practice should lead to love and compassion

<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11953/20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=01:05:21" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Now, it _can_ be that hearing about [[emptiness]], when we first hear about it, it sounds very <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nihilism" data-href="Nihilism" class="internal-link">nihilistic</a>, very destructive teaching, very scary often, teaching. But if our practice of it and contemplation of [[emptiness]] is not leading to [[love]] and [[compassion]], is not opening [[love]] and [[compassion]] to some degree, there's something askew in how we're seeing it, in how we're practising it, in how we're viewing [[emptiness]]. So by its [[nature]], it should lead to more of a sense of [[love]]. If it's not, we need to look again. There's something we're not quite <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>. We're just a bit off balance with it. But ==it leads to more [[love]], to less of a sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a>, less of a sense of barriers, less of a sense of fault-finding with oneself, with others, with situations, even - less self-inflating, deflating, etc.== And in a way, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a> of practice as it deepens is to see that - we begin to see that all things are empty. All things. So selves are empty - my self, another self. Things are empty - so-called 'inner' things, so-called 'outer' things. _Minds_ are empty - what we call '[[consciousness]]' is actually empty, doesn't really exist as something separate, independent. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Suffering</a>, too, is empty. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Suffering</a> doesn't actually exist independently. And somehow, with all of that, in all of that, mysteriously, even though no selves, no others, no <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, even, somehow, more [[love]] and [[compassion]] is coming out of it, in the sort of mystery of the paradox of it.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And so I want to reiterate, I'm aware that sometimes we hear this, and it just, "I don't know what this is talking about." But this is actually possible for us. This really is possible. So if not through this avenue, through other <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> avenues.

<span class="paragraph">Just finally, from the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aksayamati Sutra" data-href="Aksayamati Sutra" class="internal-link">Akṣayamati Sūtra</a>_ and from our practice, we can see that there's a _continuum_ or a _spectrum_ of [[love]], we could say. That's not a very good word. Or _levels_ of [[love]] - even worse word. But the human [[consciousness]] moves on that continuum. It has to move on that continuum. So ==sometimes we do not feel [[love]], and we're just sitting here kind of really grinding away at the phrases, planting the seeds of intention. Sometimes we even feel angry, and yet we're trying. And that very trying, even though we're feeling nothing or feeling the opposite, _is_ an expression of [[love]] - absolutely.== And there's a whole spectrum right from there, all the way through [[love]] to self and other and humdrum, "I [[love]] my cat, I [[love]] whatever it is," all the through to this very exalted-sounding [[love]] without an object. And that's all there. And the human [[consciousness]], amazingly, can move on that spectrum. It _does_ move on that spectrum. And that whole spectrum is available for us. And in a way, our very humanity is _in_ that movement. So we can't always be in the exalted realms - no way. Our very humanity is in the movement. And in a way, our very humility is in the movement. It _has_ to move.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Careful. It may work at times for you. Play with it, play with it. But there's probably something in it that doesn't cover quite - [[emptiness]] has a lot of aspects to what it means. And in a way, it's also very thorough. So it's like, sometimes we can have a word like that, and we're leaving something unchallenged. And there needs to be a real thoroughness. So we've got rid of a lot of stuff, but there's left this sense of a womb or whatever, and that kind of thing. But it may be a really important stepping-stone, so don't necessarily just throw it out immediately. You want to experiment with it a little bit. But bear in [[mind]], it's probably not going to be a final resting place.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: No, it's good. This is really important. Thank you very much for bringing it up. There are certain experiences that are deep experiences, quite common, and relatively speaking, quite accessible for a committed meditator. One of them will be a sense of [[consciousness]] opening out in very vast [[spaciousness]], and one is just open and being. There's very little <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a>, and just a sense of things emerging from this space in quite an insubstantial way, emerging from the space and disappearing back into it. Beautiful state, very open, oftentimes brings a lot of [[love]] and a lot of sense of [[freedom]] with it. Not that far off for a committed meditator. If it sounds fantastic, it's actually not that far off. Very, very beautiful, a lot of [[freedom]] in it, a lot to learn from it, and yet what happens - and I see it so much. And it's gone on more than 2,000 years. It predates the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> - one then gives an inherent existence to that [[spaciousness]], and that [[spaciousness]] as a womb, as a source. It reifies that, and then people substitute the word '[[emptiness]]' for that empty space. It's a beautiful and, for a lot of people, a really necessary stepping-stone.</span>

##### You don't want to rush through those beautiful states, but also not misunderstand them as ultimate

<span class="paragraph">So the other extreme (and I should have said it when I was talking) is these states that can open - [[oneness]], or this kind of big space out of which everything is emerging, or [[compassion]] that is woven into the fabric of the universe - beautiful states, you don't also want to rush through them. So again, there's a <a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a> here: you don't want to stop there, pitch your camp, build your house, say, "I've arrived. Now all I need to do is just get used to this," and say, "This is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ultimate truth" data-href="Ultimate truth" class="internal-link">the ultimate</a> truth. I've discovered it." [laughter] It happens! Believe me. It happens in texts you can find - it's gone on for thousands and thousands of years. I meet people all the time where this has gone on, people who have done a lot of practice. So it's very tempting to do that. So you don't want to do that on one extreme. But on the other extreme, you don't want to just say, "Oh, this is just another condition. Better get going!" [laughter] ==There's something in opening to a state like that - whatever it is, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharmadhatu" data-href="Dharmadhatu" class="internal-link">infinite consciousness</a> pervading the universe - these are all quite related states, very, very, potentially incredibly transforming for the long term. People often fall into one of two extremes with them. One is to reify them and think they've arrived somewhere, and actually stop short their questioning in the path.== It's just, "That's it. There's nothing more." Or dismiss them too quickly and not hang out and really let the being, let the heart be transformed by what's in that state and what one can learn in that state.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: The [[experience]] that you were describing is still conditioned. Now, there's a sense - and as I said, it's a very beautiful sense - that a person in that state will feel, what's conditioned is the things arising and passing back into that state. But the space itself, what some people call _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharmadhatu" data-href="Dharmadhatu" class="internal-link">dharmadhātu</a>_, or some people call it _[[rigpa]]_, or a lot of different charged words get used, or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharmadhatu" data-href="Dharmadhatu" class="internal-link">infinite consciousness</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharmadhatu" data-href="Dharmadhatu" class="internal-link">cosmic consciousness</a>, etc. - [a person will feel] that that's _unconditioned_. It can seem, in the [[experience]] - very beautiful - that that's _so_ steady. And everything else, all other [[experience]] - <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a>, thoughts, [[emotions]] - all that is arising out of the stillness, _imperturbable_ stillness, and dying back into it. One _feels_ like one is seeing the [[birth]] and [[death]] of [[experience]], and what remains seems unconditioned, and it's _there_. And it's just a matter of, sometimes I lose contact with it; then I get back into contact. But still, one hasn't seen and understood at the deepest level the [[nature]] of [[perception]]. The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> said to understand fully the [[nature]] of [[perception]] is to be fully awakened. Put that way, it doesn't sound very sexy, does it? [laughter] But there's something in there - it's so _uncompromising,_ and so, kind of, =="I won't put the pole here; I'll keep going, keep the questioning alive," until one has totally understood this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a> and how anything at all - no matter how beautiful, how subtle, how refined, how seemingly ultimate - comes to be. And that doesn't mean dismissing everything as just conditions, and it's just all irrelevant. It doesn't mean that at all, because one also opens to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">the Unconditioned</a> and the [[beauty]] of what that means as well.== So, thank you. It's a really, really important question.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**Q2: working with old [[anxiety]]**</span>

---
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Are people clear with the practice side of this approach?</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: No. [laughs] You spoke about [[fear]], but what I've been working with today is [[anxiety]]. It's very much not future-based. In fact, it feels very old, you know, and it just gets [?]. And it's not dissolving. Maybe I can just apply a little bit more patience, or maybe I'm not applying the method in quite a right way. But it did hang around all day. I mean, in some way, it doesn't matter. So what? It's been thirty years ... [?] I mean, am I just not applying the method right? Because it's closely related to [[fear]], but it's not [[fear]]. There isn't really any thinking, and certainly not any [[future thinking]]. It's just hanging around. Because I know where it comes from, I was trying to picture it wrapped up in a nice, cosy [?].</span>
<span class="paragraph">That was kind of how the, you know, sort of surrounding it with [[love]] when it was coming. But it didn't dissolve. In fact, it got worse - or should I say, stronger and even less pleasant than it was at the beginning this ...?</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Okay. I'm not sure if you're doing it right or not. It's possible that there is a hidden agenda of trying to get rid of it through doing this.</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: Not that I can see, but yeah, if it's hidden I wouldn't see it. [laughter]</span>

##### Play with a sense of welcoming, rather than wrapping fear in love

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Okay. It's possible. So you could try just really going to more of a sense of welcoming, rather than wrapping it in [[love]]. Really, really welcoming - that's one option. Remember, this is just one technique, one approach out of many. But if you want to explore it further, I would emphasize the total accepting and the welcoming. ==When anything comes up - whatever it is, [[anxiety]] or anything at all - there's conditioning from the past. As you say, this comes from the past. But that past conditioning is _not enough_ for it to arise in the present. A thing cannot arise in the present without me doing something as well in the present. And you _can't_ change the past, so to speak, but what we can do is understand, "What is it that I'm putting _in_ in the present which is sustaining or even allowing this thing to arise?"==</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Yeah, so that would be another approach very similar to what we're doing. Self-identification, like <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a>, is a builder of [[experience]]. It turns out that when we identify with what's going on, that also builds things. So you could go - if you got a foot in the door that way, great. And you can find, "What happens when I ...?" It's just something going on, and one is identified less and less. It's also, one's building [[experience]] less.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Yogi: So how would I do that?</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Well, how did you - you noticed there was identification?</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: These are practices that take time. If it's not working today and one needs relief today, then introduce some other aspect - [[compassion]] to oneself or whatever. So again, it's just some people this will be significant for, others less so. Most people, anyway, it's something to develop over time, and it's one of many practices. You want to have a range of options that you can draw from.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Absolutely, yeah, sure, understandable. So one thing is to just bypass that thinking and just go ahead and do it. Another thing is what I said about experiences and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a> are fleeting. So [[gratitude]] is something - metaphorically speaking, all [[experience]] is impoverished because of its fleeting [[nature]]. And it's almost like it's just part of the stream of [[experience]], and so give it [[compassion]], you know, using metaphorical, almost poetic kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a>. Don't think about it; just do it. It's more, we're interested in the ability to do that. As someone said, "If I do that, then maybe something opens up _more_." So again, skilful abiding in ease, and deepening ease, and also the [[insight]] - "What happens when I do it?" So I would just kind of set it aside and just go ahead, full steam ahead.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Yogi: I sort of related to that. I mean, you were saying about this is complete welcoming, like when the first sun comes out in the spring, and you completely open to it. That - <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kusala" data-href="Kusala" class="internal-link">wholesome</a> things arising - it seems to me it's fairly easy to do that.

<span class="paragraph">Rob: It may take time, absolutely. So I mean, people are very different. Some people immediately pick up on something, that it's actually easing this - like I said, when there's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a> there, when there's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a> and pulling, there's more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the [[experience]]. So even though there's [[pain]], it pays to relax the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a>. Some people see that immediately, and it's just very clear: "Well, okay. Let's just do that." Others, it takes longer, and it's fine. And so, it may take time, but it also may not take time. Is it harder with more difficult experiences? Yeah, maybe, but also maybe not. Just play with it. Play with it and see.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Yeah. Well, if one directs [[love]] towards something or bathes it in [[love]], and then one notices, "Oh, this problematic thing goes away a little bit," and then a little time goes by, and something else problematic comes up, and the immediate thought is, "Ah, I'll knock it on the head with some _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_!" [laughter] "And hopefully that'll get rid of it." One just has to watch that that's the intention, or if that's there. And it _will_ creep in. It will creep in, but can one either be coming from, as much as possible, a place of curiosity? I'm just curious what it does when I do that, just curious. So it's a different thing. I'm not looking for it to go away. I'm just curious about how things arise and what the [[nature]] of [[experience]] is. So either curiosity or one can just kind of intend for the welcoming to be completely genuine, just really, really genuine. So it's something you have to feel when it's there, and just try and soften it or open it more inside.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: I don't know how to answer that question, but I know that it's possible to open to something which is unconditioned in a way that brings [[freedom]], and in a way, that's all we need to know - that that's possible, and that the conditions, we can take care of the conditions that move us towards that. That's possible. Whether it's something conditioned experiencing something unconditioned, or - I don't know about that. I don't think that's quite the right question. It's more like, "Is it possible to [[experience]] something [[unfabricated]], <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">unborn</a>, unconditioned, deathless?"
