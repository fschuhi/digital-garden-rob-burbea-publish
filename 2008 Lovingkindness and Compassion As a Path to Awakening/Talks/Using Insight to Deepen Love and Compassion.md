[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion -|plain list]]

##### What helps, what blocks loving-kindness?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^1-1" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^1-1" class="internal-link">1-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11956/20080202-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-using_insight_to_deepen_love_and_compassion-11956.mp3#t=00:05" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So we can <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a>, develop, expand the heart's capacity for <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>. That is possible for us, and in the process of doing that we need to be asking, well, what helps that process? What feeds that process? How does that expansion come about? How does the heart grow in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>? We need to be asking those questions and also asking, what blocks it? What starves it? What gets in the way?</span>

##### Faith in reconditioning mind and heart by just repeting the phrases; samadhi
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^1-2" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">Devotion</a> · <a data-href="Reconditioning" class="internal-link">Reconditioning</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2) · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11956/20080202-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-using_insight_to_deepen_love_and_compassion-11956.mp3#t=00:49" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And so very broadly speaking, just the repetition of the phrases, on the cushion, in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">walking meditation</a>, just having <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a> in that level of <a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a> the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, <a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a> the heart - hugely significant. And just over and over again, we are retraining the intentionality in the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> and the heart. And sometimes, when the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ itself is there, that, too, is a way in which the heart's capacity increases.</span>

##### Body sensitivity allows samadhi to go deeper
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^1-3" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> (3) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (5) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (8) · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> · <a data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">Pleasantness</a> · <a data-href="Feelings" class="internal-link">Feelings</a> · <a data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">Habit</a> (3) · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11956/20080202-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-using_insight_to_deepen_love_and_compassion-11956.mp3#t=01:47" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">There are many ways this happens. Some are on the cushion in full <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> and some informal. So how we act, how we speak, what we choose, how we are in our interactions - that's feeding the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ as well. And we need to inquire into that - as important what happens outside of formal <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> as it is inside. And then, within formal <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>, sometimes it feels like it's going well, okay? It feels good. There's the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ there - great, lovely, and put a lot of emphasis on this, inclining towards that. So this is why we keep saying about the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> sensitivity. ==And you drop a word in or a phrase, and it has some resonance in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> sensitivity, or the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> feels peaceful, there's a feeling of peace around, there's a feeling of warmth, of <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> - actually connecting with that in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, feeling it, feeling just a sense of comfort in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, just a vague, unremarkable sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a>. That connection with those kinds of <a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a> in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> helps the _samādhi_.== It allows the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a> to go deeper. And in so doing, the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ kind of gets into the cells, becomes, in a very deep way, part of the <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a>, a <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a> for the being, a <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a> for the <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> via the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> and via the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_.</span>

##### If it doesn't feel to be going well, just keep having faith
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^1-4" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> · <a data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">Devotion</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11956/20080202-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-using_insight_to_deepen_love_and_compassion-11956.mp3#t=03:20" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And sometimes, it doesn't feel to be going well. It feels like there's no feeling, I'm even irritated or whatever, aversive, there's <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> around, whatever it is - doesn't feel like it's going well. That's fine too. And what we said right at the beginning: just keep having <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a> in this planting of the seeds with the phrases, just planting the seeds of intention. ==Not to jump too much into judging one's practice, by whether it feels like it's going well or whether it feels like it's going badly. There's too much going on, so to speak, underneath the radar, in the darkness of what is not conscious, and we have to kind of respect that and have some <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a> in the process.==</span>

##### Simile: gardener having faith that the seed grows underground
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^1-5" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^1-5" class="internal-link">1-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">Devotion</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">I can't remember if I said this already in here, but when a farmer or a gardener plants a seed, the germination of that seed, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a> of that seed goes on underneath the ground, in the darkness, invisible. And it's very similar with the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice. There's a lot going on at levels we don't actually have access to. To trust that. So there is certainly the fact of the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ deepening and expanding through the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, but also deepening and expanding through just this patient <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a> in the planting of the seeds.</span>

---
##### As we practice metta, insight comes with that
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^2-1" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (6) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (3) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (4) · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11956/20080202-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-using_insight_to_deepen_love_and_compassion-11956.mp3#t=04:47" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">What I want to go into today is the relationship of <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> and the deepening of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and the deepening of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. So on this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, what we talk about - and we've already started, and it kind of gets more and more as it goes on - is the way that the practices of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> actually bring <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>, as part of what they bring. They bring a liberating <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>. They bring <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> that frees. This is not the usually understood way of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, but it's there. And as we practise <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> comes with that - _can_ come with that. It's a possibility.</span>

---
##### It works the other way around as well: insight feeds loving-kindness and compassion
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^2-2" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (2) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3) · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11956/20080202-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-using_insight_to_deepen_love_and_compassion-11956.mp3#t=05:37" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">What I want to talk about today is the other way round: how it might be that <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> feeds <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. So I'm talking about the ways <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> can be fed: in our lives, in our interactions, in the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, through the patient planting of the seeds, and now just this piece about <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> leading to <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>.</span>

##### Are we creating metta or are we uncovering it?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^2-3" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">Fabrication</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (3) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> · <a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> · <a data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">Avijja</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11956/20080202-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-using_insight_to_deepen_love_and_compassion-11956.mp3#t=06:01" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Sometimes we can be doing this practice, and we feel as if we are creating the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_. You're sort of sitting and huffing and puffing and squeezing and ... [laughs] And if you're lucky, you know, a drop of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_. It feels like it's something <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a>, created, which it _is_, on one level. But sometimes we might ask ourselves a question: is <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> something created? Now, actually it _is_, but are _we_ creating it? What's actually going on there? Or is it maybe the case that <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> may be the natural state and a natural expression when the heart, when the <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> is not entangled or obscured or clouded by <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a> and by <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a>? It's much more as if one is _uncovering_ <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and _uncovering_ <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. So that's an interesting question: what's actually going on here? Are we creating it? Or are we _uncovering_ it? Are we _allowing_ it?</span>

##### Insight is any kind of understanding that releases clinging and thus suffering

<span class="paragraph">When we talk about <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a>, it's a very good question to ask: what does that mean?

What is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a>? <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> is an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> - so either intellectual or intuitive, any kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> - that releases <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a>, and in so doing, releases <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>.

<span class="paragraph">When the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> talked about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a>, there's a number of ways of interpreting it. One way would be that it's just kind of sitting around, or watching what's going on, and trying not to _do_ much. [laughs] And hopefully out of that, _budoom_, up comes an <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>, which is perfectly valid, to an extent. [laughter] But sometimes we might find, you're watching your <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, or just, you know ... [huffing and puffing] "In, out, in, out, arising, falling, arising, falling," and _hoping_ that out of that, <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> cracks into the being. Or just trying to sit there doing nothing, and again the hope, the assumption is that in that 'doing nothing,' an <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> will be born. There is definitely something to that, and in a way - I'm not putting it in very attractive terms, but it's actually a very beautiful approach to practice.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Oftentimes, though, the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> talks about another approach, which is more, "Can we practise <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a> and ways of relating?" So what he means when he talks about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a> or <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> is _practising_ certain <a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a> at <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> in the moment, _practising_ <a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a> that bring release, that let go of the <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a>. ==So we typically look in ways that actually lead to <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a>, lead to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. That's what we do all the time. The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> said, "Can you learn to look in different ways that bring release?" Release of the <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a> brings release from <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, and that brings love.== That brings <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>, practising ways of [seeing] - I'll go into what I mean. I'm talking a little bit abstractly.

##### Fear is an aversion that blocks love

<span class="paragraph">In a way, I sort of want to start by going off on a bit of a tangent. But it always seems relevant on this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, so I'm going to do it again. And that has to do with - to speak a little bit about <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>. So <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> actually is an example of a kind of <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a> or a kind of <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>. <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> is actually a species of <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> that blocks <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> blocks <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. And to investigate this in our lives. Is that the case, that when we're afraid there's a kind of closing of the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>? And we might notice - if you pay <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a>, you might notice that ==<a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> have this kind of inverse relationship. Originally, the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> offered the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice to a group of monks who were really, really afraid in the forest. That was his initial offering as an antidote and as a response to fear.==^[According to the commentary to the _Sutta Nipāta_, the Buddha taught the _Mettā Sutta_ (Sn 1:8) as a protective discourse to a group of monks who were experiencing frightening visions and sounds produced by hostile deities. See Bhikkhu Bodhi, tr., _The Suttanipāta: An Ancient Collection of the Buddha's Discourses Together with Its Commentaries_ (Boston: Wisdom, 2017), 566-7] But we might notice in our lives that when <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> is strong, <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> is weak. And when <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> is strong, <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> is weak. They have this inverse relationship. And conversely, we might also notice, in ourselves and in the world, when <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> is strong, violence - either a psychological or a physical violence - is strong. It goes with <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>. You can see this very easily in animals, in beings, in ourselves, in political groups, in ideological groups.</span>

##### Samadhi can bring up fear

<span class="paragraph">So I want to say a little bit about working with <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, because often it _does_ come up in the context of a <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> like this anyway for people. And working with <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> would usually come under the umbrella of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a>, learning to work with that. I mentioned in one of the talks (I think it was the talk on _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_): sometimes in a practice like this - we're sitting, walking - _something_ feels like it's deepening and opening. And maybe just isolated moments, or little stretches of time or whatever, the being, the <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>, finds itself in territory that's unfamiliar: much more open, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a> have changed a little bit, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> feels different, the sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">separation</a> feels different, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a> feels different, maybe dramatically so, maybe just a little bit. And this can bring up <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>.</span>

##### When the fear is not that strong, you can dip into what's enjoyable and not give so much attention to the fear
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^3-4" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^3-4" class="internal-link">3-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (8) · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> · <a data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">Pleasantness</a> (3) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">Letting go</a> · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">And very, very skilful to learn, if the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> is not too strong, then actually one has a choice in that moment. With that opening, the opening of the being, the opening of <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>, there will be some <a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a> with that, alongside the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>. And this <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> and the <a data-href="pleasantness" class="internal-link">pleasantness</a> coexist. What usually happens is we get sucked into the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, and like a magnet, we go into the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>. We get pulled into it and spun around by it, with it. Sometimes it's possible just to sit back a little bit and have a look: I've got this pleasant <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a> in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, there's openness, there's warmth, etc. There's a <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a>, and there's <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>. And learn - and this is a skill, it's a practice - learn to incline the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> towards what's enjoyable in there. So in that openness, there _will_ be something that's enjoyable. It's an acquired taste to learn how to dip in a little bit, dip in. You can be in control of this. You can dip into what's enjoyable and not give so much <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>. You don't have to ignore it, but you also don't have to feed it by getting obsessed with it and worried about it and drawn into it. So this is a practice, but it's actually very important, when the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> is not that strong.</span>

##### When the fear is stronger, ask: what actually is fear? Body sensations

<span class="paragraph">But sometimes, of course, <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> does feel stronger. Or it feels like we're unable to do that. And sometimes we get very strong <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, maybe in the context of a <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> and, of course, outside a <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>. When we look at <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, we have to ask, what actually is <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>? What is the <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> of <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>? It's an interesting one - or <a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a>. And when we look, what do we see in the <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>? So oftentimes we don't hang out with it long enough to actually unpack it and see what's there. What we notice with <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> is usually unpleasant <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a> - in the extreme, the heart is pounding, the tummy is in knots or butterflies. Unpleasant <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> sensation, and <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> to the physical sensations. We don't like them. We want to get rid of them. That's there alongside the unpleasant sensations. So <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a> and <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>.</span>

##### Thoughts also have aversion associated with them

<span class="paragraph">Thoughts. Often thoughts, and often future thoughts, associated with <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, and unpleasant thoughts about what's going to happen or what might happen. Thoughts associated with <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, as part of the constellation of <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, and again, their unpleasantness, the <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> to them, <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> to that. So there are the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a> and the thoughts, and in each case there's <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>.</span>

##### Inner texture of the mind shrinks when there's fear around

<span class="paragraph">Third factor, a little more subtle, with <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> is the kind of climate of the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, the inner texture of the way the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> feels. And when there's <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> around, it shrinks. The <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> shrinks. It gets small. You notice this with <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>? The actual <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> feels like it's constricting. That, generally speaking, is unpleasant. Human beings don't like a constricted <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>. And so, again, it being unpleasant, there's going to be <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> to it: I want to get rid of it. I want it to go away. ==So there's the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, the thoughts, and the texture, the climate of the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, and correspondingly, the <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> to that.==</span>

##### We are afraid of fear, but we can be with this, which brings confidence

<span class="paragraph">These aversions are very important to investigate, because when we ask, "What's my relationship with <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>?" - and this is a fundamental <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> question, "What's my relationship with _anything_?" - usually the relationship with <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> is, we're afraid of it. We're actually afraid of <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>. We have <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> of <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>. This is part of what makes <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> _<a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>_. It's that we're actually afraid of the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> itself. As our <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation practice</a>, in general, develops over time, we learn to - ==we _can_ learn to accommodate that <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> of <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>: the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, the thinking <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, and the texture of the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>. We learn to just bring <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> to it and just to be with it.== And what we get, slowly, over time, is a sense of confidence that it's just some unpleasant sensations, just some unpleasant thoughts: "I can be with this. <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> can hold it." ==What's almost always lacking with <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> is confidence. We don't feel confident that we can actually be with the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> and accommodate it, and be okay with it. With practice, bringing <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> to all of it, we just see: it's just that, and it's accommodatable.

##### Fear of fear feeds the fire of the fear
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^4-5" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^4-5" class="internal-link">4-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (9) · <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> (4) · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (2) · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a> (3)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So usually our relationship with <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> is one of <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> or fleeing. We want to get away from, run away from the unpleasantness of it. But that very <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> and fleeing makes the <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> of the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> increase. This <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> of the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, this <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> to the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, is part of the whole constellation. It's part of the whole mechanism and wheel of <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>. It makes it more difficult. When there are unpleasant <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> sensations in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> and we flee them out of <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>, out of <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> of them, where do we go? Where do we flee to? Straight up into the head! The <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> goes away from the groundedness in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> and straight up into the head. There's more <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> in the thinking. There are already unhelpful, unskilful, unpleasant thoughts in the thinking, looping around. You've just injected a whole lot of extra <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> in there because one is fleeing. And it increases, actually feeding the whole fire of the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>.</span>

##### Fear needs me to be aversive and reactive to it
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^5-1" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^5-1" class="internal-link">5-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> (6) · <a data-href="Anxiety" class="internal-link">Anxiety</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So the reaction that we have to <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> is not something separate from the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> itself. They're not two separate things. The reaction is part of the <a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a> itself. So you can check this out. They're not two separate things. If we can soften that reaction or take away that reaction somewhat, what we'll notice is that <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> cannot support itself. It cannot support itself. So not to take this on authority just because I say it or someone else says it. See if one can experiment with this when <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> is around. <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> needs me to be aversive and reactive to it. The reaction is part of the mechanism. What happens when I soften that reaction? <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> cannot support itself without me fearing it, without me reacting to it.</span>

##### Self-judgement is also fuel for the fire of fear

<span class="paragraph">Sometimes our relationship with <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> is putting pressure - part of the <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> - pressure on it to be different. It's all the same: it's fuel for the fire of <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>. So to be aware of these mechanisms, to see, "Can they be relaxed? Can I soften them?" Or judging myself - if I judge myself that <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> is around, again, it's fuel for the fire. What am I assuming about myself because there's <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> around? What am I assuming about my practice? That I'm a failure, that it's rubbish, that I'm not getting anywhere - just because <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> is around? That's also something that we're injecting into the moment that's building the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> is human. Can we see the humanity of it? Can we bring <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>, again, to meet that humanity, to meet the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>?

There's <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> around. Who is the 'I'? The 'I' is me with <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>. It's not me without the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, me when the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> goes away, me and idealized fear.== You could say, in that moment, you are you with <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, I am I with <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>. It's included. We have a tendency - it's all part of the <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> and the almost normal reaction to <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, to want to get it away, and to even exclude that part from the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_.</span>

<span class="paragraph">The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>, over and over again, points to cultivating qualities of heart, qualities of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, qualities of being - like _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, like <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, etc., <a data-href="generosity" class="internal-link">generosity</a>, <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a>, a whole host of inner qualities that become our kind of (what's that word?) 'investment portfolio.' [laughter] If you know that term from whatever, stocks and all that stuff. Very actually rare maturity in practice, very rare maturity. Often we can just say, "Yeah, yeah, I know, that's what I need to be happy. I know that I really need to build these qualities. I know that's where <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> comes from." Very rare level of maturity in practice to come across someone who's actually living that out, and putting the investment in that, and not worrying _so_ much about the other stuff. And of _course_, we need to take care of material things, etc. But it's actually quite a mature practice that has come to the point when it's just convinced in the heart, in the being: "I know where to put my eggs. I know what it is that leads to <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> and peace. I know how to take care of the future." And you think how much <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, as well, in this respect has to do with, "What will they think of me? What will people I'm meeting - what are they going to think? Are they going to think I'm stupid, or ugly, or boring, or whatever it is?" How much of our <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> is social <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, is around that?</span>

<span class="paragraph">And also in the relationship to the present.

When the relationship to the present has those qualities in it, the future takes care of itself, just moment by moment. Those two pieces - cultivating what's beautiful, and taking care of the relationship with the present - the future is taken care of in the deepest way. And in a very real way, we come to worry less about, "Will there be enough money later on? Will there be security? Will I be okay in terms of a house? What will happen in terms of, will I find a partner? Will my partner die? Will they stay with me? Will I be alone?" All that stuff, not that it's not important stuff in our lives, but its hold on us, and the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> that oftentimes is around - we don't even realize it's around, running our lives, running our choices. How much of that stuff is actually dictating our choices in our life? And we don't even register it as a kind of <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>. And that stuff just begins to get less because of the power of cultivating what's beautiful, over time. And this is something very real. It's not theoretical, and it's not unrealistic. It's something very, very real that can come into the being, into one's life in a very real, very practical way.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So these are just some of the possibilities, and I think I want to go through - I think there are seven here [**(_i_)-(_vii_)** below]. I mentioned the other day, in the talk the other night, as we do the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice, in a very non-linear way, there can be a deepening.

When we talk about _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>_ - and John talked the other day about _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>_, and I touched on it - when we talk about that, it's actually not the same as <a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a>.

<span class="paragraph">I pretty much completely disagree, and I don't think that's the way the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> intended it or meant it. They are <a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a>, skills in looking, that in looking bring - _should_ bring, if one's going about it the right way, _should_ bring a sense of <a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a> and <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. They're practices, <a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a>, lenses for looking at <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> in the moment that _should_ bring with them <a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a> and <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. And if they're not, if they don't, it means one needs to play with it, tinker with it, until one learns to contemplate that way, contemplate one of the <a data-href="three characteristics" class="internal-link">three characteristics</a>, or all of them, in ways that actually bring <a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a> and <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. So it is unfortunate there is this - well, quite a number of strands in the traditions that really feel that one should have a kind of existential angst, or trembling, or <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, or misery, or <a data-href="depression" class="internal-link">depression</a>, or kind of _blah_, or whatever.

<span class="paragraph">**Rob**: Is it a cultural thing? No, it's not. Thank you for saying that. It's not just a cultural thing.

But also want to put out there a sense of how deep these practices of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> can actually go. They're almost - not infinite, but an incredible depth of refinement and subtlety that can come into this practice.

<span class="paragraph">**(_i_)** At one level, what the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> meant, what he talked about, is **remembering <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a> - remembering <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a> and the unpredictability of life**. So we can be doing the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice, and one's directing, attempting to direct the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ towards another being and just holding, in the background of <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, just a light reflection on the fact of their mortality: "They will die. Like all of us, they will die." Now, remember, as I just said, it shouldn't be bleak. ==It shouldn't be depressing, so only to use this if it feels like it's actually unlocking some <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> in the heart.== If one introduces it and it just feels like, "Ugh, gosh," a terrible <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, or morbidity or a paralysis comes in, leave it. But you may find that just giving the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ to the benefactor, giving the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ to the neutral person, whoever it is, difficult person, and one just reflects, "They are subject to <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a>. They are subject to <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a>." Very likely, they don't know _when_ they're going to die. Not just <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a>, but they're also subject to the whole range of what this word _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">anicca</a>_ means: uncertainty, change. ==And our life involves an incredible amount of uncertainty and change. That's the <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a>, that's the fabric of our existence. And they, like us, are subject to that. So just holding this lightly, this sense of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">anicca</a>_ that they are vulnerable to, holding that in the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> very lightly, as one's doing the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, can either kick-start the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ when it feels like it's a little bit blocked or it can't really get off the ground==, or deepen it at times when it already feels like it's going.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(_ii_)** There are a few more with this, just within this realm of <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a>. Another one in relation to <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a>, and it's actually more subtle and perhaps more difficult for people. I'm not sure. Practising - again, all this is practice - **practising learning to see _this moment_ in the context of our <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a>**. So I'll explain what I mean. Science, <a data-href="cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmology</a>, tells us that the universe is 13.7 billion years old - pretty old - and that it will last as least as long. Actually, its future is a little bit uncertain, but ... [laughter] It's either going to collapse back again after about the same amount of time, or keep going, don't know - long, long stretches of time. Our life within that is what? Fifty, seventy, ninety, a hundred years, if one's lucky. And there's a sense - you can practise with, you can play with this sometimes - having a sense of one's life and the lives of others being a very small, a _tiny_ span in the vastness of time, and a vastness of space. And if possible, you can even bring that into the moment.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So right now, right now, in this moment, there is a moment of <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> going on. [snaps fingers] What's happening? There's visual form, there's colour, there's sound, there's sight, there's a moment of <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a> - and it's almost like putting that in the context of this incredible vastness of time. We don't know what came before our life. We don't know what comes after, no matter what all the theories, including the Buddhist theories, say. There's _this moment_ in the context of a massive, almost unfathomably unthinkable unknown. ==And you can toy with this playing of <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a>. Something comes: this moment, <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a>, and vastness. And again, instead of unlocking <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, sometimes it can unlock more love.== So, things you can play with.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(_iii_)** What's most common when we talk about - or in the tradition, when people talk about <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a> and the contemplation of <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a>, is **trying to look, in the moment, at quite a rapid, moment-to-moment <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a> of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a>**.

<span class="paragraph">And one notices, all I see in the moment is change. There's just a moment of this [snaps fingers], a moment of that [snaps fingers], a moment - I can't find anything in there that's 'me.' So this is the way <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a> feeds into an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>_ and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a>. The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a> that one has, almost normally, the natural <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a> is that it's lasting and solid and fixed: "I am the same self I was twenty years ago, and thirty years ago, and I will be, if I'm still alive, in ten, twenty years." We have a sense of a fixed, independent, solid, lasting self. But when I look closely at my <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, what I notice is change, change, change. There's nothing I can find that I can point to and say, "Well, _that's_ what my lasting, fixed self is." All I see is change, and the question is, "_Where_ am I? Who am I?" And when I look at the <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a> of the <a data-href="present moment" class="internal-link">present moment</a>, there's a way that the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a> can become much more permeable, less solid. All I'm noticing is just moments of change. I can't find this solid self. And there's the possibility, in the context of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice, to open up that way.</span>

##### Less self, less other self to give the love to, can deepen the love

<span class="paragraph">And what _can_ happen, again, instead of <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> and <a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a> and all that, is it deepens the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. It can deepen or kick-start the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> - this sense of, "Actually, I can't find anything here that's permanent." Now, you could also contemplate another person, and contemplate, "There's nothing to find _there_ that's permanent." And this is where it starts to get a little strange, because we tend to think of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> being between self and other. And as we go into the <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a> of <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>, we find less and less of one. We find less and less solidity. And in that very moment of finding less solidity, instead of the whole <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> crumbling because we feel, "Well, who's giving <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> to whom?" [laughter] If I don't find anything here - I don't find any object to give it to - the opposite can happen. And almost paradoxically, there's a deepening of the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. Less self, less _other_ self to give the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> to, and somehow, there's a deepening of the quality of the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> - _can_ be. Remember, all this is just actually very rapidly painting a whole range of possibilities. That was three, with the <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(_iv_)** There's another one, and this is really quite subtle, this one. So I'm not going in any particular order of difficult or subtle or whatever, but ... point to it.

Change, change, change, change, change. Can't find anything that's not changing. What do I find, though, when I look, and I look for myself? All I see, all I can find, are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a>.</span>

When I look for it, all I find are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a>, which are actually inseparable from the rest of the universe. They are inseparable. This is quite a subtle point. It's not an easy point either to understand or to work with in <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>, but I want to mention it. ==I find nothing but <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a>, and they are inseparable, and in a way, it's seeing - it's a way that this <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a> can lead to an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> of emptiness.== Can't find a separate self. And again, can't find a giver of the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> or a receiver of the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and yet, in that, it deepens the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So that was, I think, four possibilities in the realm of <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a>. I'm just putting like a buffet out there that you can choose from if you want.

<span class="paragraph">**(_v_)** So now this one is back to a relatively simple way of going about things. Just to realize: <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> is part of life. Okay? <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Suffering</a> comes into everyone's life, in all kinds of ways and all kinds of levels. This is just a fact of our existence. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Four Noble Truths" data-href="Four Noble Truths" class="internal-link">First Noble Truth</a>, <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> said: "There is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, _<a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a>_." There is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, and a whole range of it and a whole breadth of it. And sometimes we're doing the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ - and later on, all this applies to <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practice as well, and we'll move on to <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> next week - **one is doing the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice, and just to drop in, directing it to someone else, just to drop in, "We are all in the same boat. We are all in the same boat with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>."** So, this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> experiences <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. That <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, experiences <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, experiences <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a>, experiences discomfort, experiences illness at times, will <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a>. Some of these blend into each other. But just to reflect - you can just drop this in or have it as a light background to help the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, or kick-start the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_: "We're all in the same boat. We all share these encounters with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in our life. We all meet <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in all kinds of ways - through the difficulties we have in relationship, and circumstance, and life, and <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, internally in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> and the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>." To bring that in as ways of feeding, deepening, injecting some life sometimes into the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice. So we're all in the same boat. (It's not a great phrase, but you know what I mean.)</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(_vi_)** Second one, still in the realm of this characteristic of _<a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a>_: If, at some point, either on this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> or another <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, if you **just lightly put your <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> in the chest area - in the heart <a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a>, the heart chakra, whatever you want to call it - you just lightly keep the <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> there, and you notice how it opens and closes.** The actual sense, energetically, or even subtly physically, of the heart, heart <a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a>, opens and closes. And it _will_ open and close many times in a day, countless times in our life. Opens and closes. **If you just have a light <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> and interest there to when it's open and when it's closed, the heart <a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a>, what you notice is: when there's <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a>, guess what? [laughs] Closed, no entry! ==When we release <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a>, the heart <a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a> opens.==** Now, you can actually feel this. This is, again, why I keep going on about the sensitivity to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>. You can actually feel this: the heart <a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a> opening and closing. It may not be that dramatic, so we may not be talking about colossal differences of opening and closing, but just little movements, and notice the relationship with <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a>. ==Why did the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> go on and on and on and on about <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a>? <a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> brings <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. <a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> closes the heart. Releasing <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a> brings <a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a>; it also brings <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. And we can notice this so we're crystal clear about it, and there's just no arguing about it. It's very, very clear to us. We feel it in the heart and in the body.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">Now, the good news is, part of the good news is that we can learn to become sensitive to this movement, to notice when there's <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a>. ==By '<a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a>,' I mean <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a> what we don't like, over-identifying with things, trying to hold on to things, to grasp at things - all that is clinging.== And we can begin to feel that and see this relationship, as I said, with the heart.

Don't _leave_ me!" [laughter] This is very obvious. Or, you know, "If you go, I'm going to jump out of the window" or whatever. [laughter] It's obvious that <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a> is there. But <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a> has an enormous range to it. Again, like all these <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> questions, it gets extremely subtle, extremely subtle. Part of the good news is that we can develop the subtlety of our sensitivity and be more and more aware of when <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a> is there.</span>

And sometimes - even better news - we don't even know what we're <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a> to, but just the releasing of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, the relaxing of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> sense, can release the <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a> and open the heart.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And - sometimes deliberately, sometimes we realize we're doing it; most of the time we don't - we're saying, "Me. Mine. This is me. This is mine." And the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> is saying, can you practise - it's a gradual thing to develop this practice - can you practise seeing it in the moment, as 'not me, not mine'? So a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> sensation comes up, and it's 'just happening.' A thought comes up and it's 'just happening.' It's 'not me, not mine.' And one learns to actually look at the <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> through a lens - instead of the lens of 'me, mine, me, mine, me, mine' - **look at the <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> through a lens of 'it's just happening, it's not me, it's not mine.'** It's a practice. And again, what happens? It may seem paradoxical. What happens? <a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a> and <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> are liberated in that way of relating. I'm talking about very real possibilities for practice. And again, for those with that <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> or have got that way of practising already, you can drop that in as a backdrop for the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice. So you open the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> up and just regard things as 'just happening,' as 'not me, not mine,' and into the <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> comes more <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>.</span>

##### Self-judgement

<span class="paragraph">One of the particular areas where we get entangled, and certainly on a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">meditation retreat</a>, is self-judgment. So something comes up for us, or our practice feels difficult, or we're sitting here doing _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, and then we get irritation, or <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>, or some negative thoughts, and we judge that. We judge ourselves, and we measure ourselves: "How am I doing? How is my practice going?" Very normal. That measuring and judging and comparing is actually part of the <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a> of what self does. ==The way self builds itself is through judging, measuring, comparing, and evaluating.==</span>

##### With metta you take away the energy from the pattern of self-judging
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^13-3" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^13-3" class="internal-link">13-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> (2) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (4) · <a data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">Habit</a> (2) · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So to recognize that it's going to be part of the <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>. It's going to be part of the <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>. The question is, how can I relate to it in a way that's most helpful? That's a whole other subject, but first of all, one of the ways is just to keep doing the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_. And realize that we have a <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a> of judging, of measuring ourselves, of comparing, of evaluating, and just to keep doing the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ is taking away the <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> from that <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a> pattern and feeding what's more helpful: the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ to our self. But also, sometimes, to just see that these thoughts that we're judging, or this state of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, it's like they arise out of nowhere. They're 'just happening.' They're 'not me, not mine.' We take them to be 'me' or 'mine.' They're like a shooting star in the sky, in the night sky: it just appears out of nowhere and then disappears. The more we can begin to see things that way, the less identification, and the less dragged down we are in self-judgment, self-criticism, comparing, measuring, evaluating ourselves. So this is really a practice that we can develop.</span>

##### Seeing the non-ownership of the aggregates can be also done with another being

<span class="paragraph">And one can do this business with the non-ownership of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a>, you can do it with another being. So again, you're directing the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ to another being, and just say, "_Their_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> doesn't belong to them. Their <a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a>, their <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a>, their thoughts, their <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> - it's all ownerless. It's just stuff happening, stuff arising." And again, you get this sense of not much of a giver of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, not much of a receiver of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, and yet it deepens it, can deepen it.</span>

It's important that you take what feels helpful, and the rest - to let it go, really let it go. I put a lot out there because people are very different.

It's important that you find ways of working that feel <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Juiciness" data-href="Juiciness" class="internal-link">juicy</a> and alive to you.

<span class="paragraph">Yogi: Can I ask about different <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a>? I was practising with my neutral person, and I think I was trying to find ways of making him more interesting.

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Mm, lovely, yeah. Beautiful, beautiful.</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: And I started finding that it was almost like - I felt like I might be _stalking,_ more so ... [laughter] And it also got too fixed. It felt like I was fixing them too much - how they were doing, how they do life, or who they were. And so I had a go at practising this _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>_ thing. And I found that I couldn't hold both. It felt too - it feels like _both_ are true, and so, I found I couldn't hold both. I couldn't actually hold the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>_ for very long. So I went back; I tried to find a sort of slightly less _fixed_ way. But I'm just interested in, okay, there are different ways of viewing self, so how ...? You said something about things coexisting, and for me they didn't. The two of those didn't kind of exist that way. So how do you work with ...?</span>

##### We can make things real by fixing them in a certain ways, like dressing them up in different outfits
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^14-9" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^14-9" class="internal-link">14-9</a>**: _<a data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anatta</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Good. So in other words, the two - you couldn't do both, meaning you couldn't keep the sense of their self and also the sense of their <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a>? Yeah, okay, thank you. Very important. So, anything is good. Anything is game in this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> - well, within certain parameters, but ... [laughter] In other words, whatever feels helpful at a certain time. So your initial thing was, "Let's make them a bit more real, a bit more ..." And in a way, we make things real by fixing them in certain ways. What you could do, just on that level, is - I remember years ago, in a class, someone was playing with dressing their - I can't remember if it was their neutral person - dressing them up in different outfits. [laughter] And so, if you've got a visual imagination, you actually picture them in different outfits. And if you want, there can be quite a range of those outfits that gives them a range of - it doesn't fix them. So anything from army fatigues to sort of what one would wear - an ascot or something, and sort of hats with ... you know. I'm being silly, but you can play with how you see them just on a very mundane level. In other words, you said, "Oh, I'm fixing them in this kind of character, or this is how they do things." Maybe just broaden that. You _don't_ know, and just imagine them some other way. You understand?</span>

<span class="paragraph">This other part - you're quite right. What you find, if you do this enough, if you work with the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>_ of someone, is that {quote as you contemplate someone's non-fixedness of self, their <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> of self, they actually begin, in your <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>, they begin to blur. And you can't fix them and hold them. So that's actually really good. It's great. Now, two things can happen. One is, with that, there can still be a sense of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. It doesn't seem so fixed and so directed, but you just follow that sense of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, and you stay with the sense of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, and don't worry so much about exactly where you're directing it, okay?

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Yeah. So I'm saying one option is - I'm going to give you two options. One option is to let them become lost and blurred. And either, like I was saying in the talk the other day, _they_ become blurred, but a sense of heart or <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> or _being_ is still there ...

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Okay. What you may find, sometimes, is that the person becomes blurred, the sense of them becomes blurred, but there's still a sense of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, and you can just feel into that and keep with that. And it's fine; you just have a vague sense of their beingness, or maybe _very,_ very vague, _very_, very blurred. But there's just a sense of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ that doesn't seem to have so much of an object. That's fine. That's actually good, and just to be in that _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ that doesn't seem to have so much a sense of an object.

<span class="paragraph">The other option, and this takes probably some practice, is that you can kind of _play_ - you will eventually find that you can play with how _formed_ you make someone. ==So you can play with kind of going into that <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>, but not too much, so you still keep them around a bit. You kind of see that they're empty, but you also don't go too far into that - you can kind of pull them back and forth on this sliding scale of emptiness.== It might sound completely unreal, but it's actually a very real possibility. You can develop the control of that. ==So you kind of make them somewhat empty, but not <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">completely empty</a>, so you've still got a sense of somewhere you can direct the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ towards.== If you've got that far in the playing, you'll probably find that it's just a matter of time before you can play with that.

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Oh. No, because it's coming out of a contemplation of their <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>. You're _seeing -_ rather than just sort of imaginally scrubbing someone out like that, ==you're actually reflecting on the <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a> of their being, reflecting on the <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a> of their <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a>, etc.== And it's that reflection, without trying to manipulate any <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a> in any way - that itself.

<span class="paragraph">Yeah. And that's actually a good point. In a talk like I gave today, partly - I don't know if it's sensible or not, but sometimes I feel like I'm almost ... There's so much information, and partly, in a way, one is giving it to the tape recorder, because I know it's too much to take in in one go. And one's bombarding - you've had instructions this morning already. And so it's almost like, "Yeah, take the tape, and just take a few pieces out." In a way, that's just going to give a lot of stuff that you can - you can go with this for years, years. You get to see, three weeks is a pretty short amount of time to investigate this stuff. You _could_ come for three months or three years, and you'd still be busy with the depth of all this and the range of all this. So it's really important that the tape is there, if you feel interested, and you begin to, "What was that thing he was going on about ...?" Or you're doing your best to pay <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a>, but it's just too much, just kind of going over the head right now. And that's one of the occupational hazards of this stuff. But I prefer to put a lot out, and hopefully people pick different pieces. But great that we have the tapes so that you _can_ refer back to them. Don't worry, as I said, if you feel like, "Oh gosh, I only got about 3 per cent of what you just said." It's totally fine.</span>

[laughter] It's very good. ==And it's an interesting thing, with a page of something, if we transcribe the talk, you can always just flip to that page, whereas with a talk you actually have to go through it in time, and it's hard to pull out the pieces - especially in a talk like today, which is basically a long, fat instruction talk, in a lot of respects. It's hard to pull out pieces when you have to go through a whole - whatever it was - an hour I talked for. Sometimes seeing it in a written page, you can just find that place, "Ah, that's exactly what I want." It's actually more helpful.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">Yogi: The <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> can only do one thing at the same time, right?</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Uhh ... [laughs] Well, say a bit more.</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: Another teacher suggested this, so on the _vipassanā_ <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> in India. So whatever you do, you move between one thing and another, somehow, like what you just asked about. Is it so or not? So that you can play around, and it doesn't actually fragment the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, as long as you play around with things that, together, those ingredients will support _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ somehow?</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Can you be a bit more specific?</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: No, I can't. I'm just wondering about, how can it work in such a way that when you offer all these elaborations - can they help you to come to a greater sense of wholeness more quickly somehow, because the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> deepens and the heart opens, right? And brings it together if the ingredients are right. Or is it so that the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> can only do one thing at the same time? I think the question is, can the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> do more than one thing at the same time, if you're in _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_? Because somehow, when I am in a sense of wholeness, it seems like the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> can do anything; the thoughts can come in, and it doesn't bother me. Right? But if I'm not, and I'm already really scattered, or [?]. But to myself - or I was lost. You know, and it's all very fragmented. Is it then better not to invite all those elaborations?</span>

##### It's usually better to wait until there's some degree of samadhi before doing insight practice

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Okay. I think I understand. It's interesting. Some people may hear some of what I've talked about today and say, "Well, my <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is too scattered; I need to get the basics down." And there's something to say about that. When the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, as you say, has some degree of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, some degree of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness</a>, it's much more malleable. We find, "Oh, I can play with this. I can pull this piece in. I can do more than one thing at once," because there's openness, there's presence, there's malleability in the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>. We can shape what's going on. But it may also be that we feel a bit unconnected, and the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ is not going very well, the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ is not going very well, and you pick up one of these pieces, and you just try doing that, and it actually helps to kick-start. So generally speaking, it's probably better to wait until there's some degree of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ and some degree of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness</a>, and you feel like, "It's going okay. Let me drop some of this in." But it may equally work that it just helps to kick-start when it feels a bit blocked. Can the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> do more than one thing at once? In _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, you could say it could, yeah, when that's around. Yeah. So it's not going to this and then to this; it's more like, in the expanse of things, holding things together, and learning to do that.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: It could. Yeah. And if it leads to more fragmentation, leave it, and come back to what's much simpler. ==So all of this, again, is in the context of responsiveness. You do something, and if it works, great. Do it more. Go for it. Do it deeper. Experiment.

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Careful you don't get it wrong - "May I _not_ be happy!" [laughter] It's a tricky one. You'll have to find what works. What I find is if you stay with just the "not me, not mine" as a very light thing, but let the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ phrases go, but keep the intention of the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ around. So it's like you're holding both things at once. It can seem very complicated, but it doesn't need to be. So you just drop the "not me, not mine" in, as a very, very [light] whisper of a phrase, in the context of the intention for <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and wanting to feel when that <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> is there, and then _feel_ the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. So you're interested in feeling the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> that comes out of it, but you can let the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ phrases go at that point, yeah. But experiment. I wouldn't put them in in the way of, "May - not me!" No, it's more - you might be down to just a word at that point, so "happy" or "peaceful," you know, and that's going on at the same time. But experiment and see. You may be doing the whole thing without any words at all, not even the "not me, not mine" or the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ phrases.

Just to trust yourself with that - yeah, I think that's important. ==To be enough in contact with one's <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> that one trusts, "This is working for me, and I know it is, and it's okay. And I trust that." That's really important, to trust one's own practice, what one sees and feels for oneself in one's own practice.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">Yogi: But you've said before that _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ can kind of come from anywhere, like the head, the big toe, whatever. But again, I think, for me, it's getting out of the head that's the big one.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: So this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> sensitivity that I've been talking about - it's very important. ==And putting the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, just gently keep putting it other places - belly, heart <a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a>, etc. And the more you do that with that sensitivity, the more the <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>, the more the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> kind of rests there, takes its <a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a> there.

##### Perceiving the body in a certain way can become self-fulfilling

<span class="paragraph">Rob: I think so. What you're describing is actually really common. Something comes up in our <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, particularly our <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, and we tend to interpret it in a certain way, in the way we're looking at it. And in so doing, we perceive it a certain way, and that actually can become self-fulfilling. So sore throat - "Oh, feels like a lump in the throat." And then actually we _begin_ to feel miserable. I remember having a very irritated eye once, and tearing, and feeling sad. This was years ago. And there was nothing going on emotionally, but it was just, somehow the association of that physical sensation and the way I was looking at it and interpreting it. So, again, a couple of options.</span>

---
##### (1) just be with those sensations
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^20-6" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^20-6" class="internal-link">20-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11956/20080202-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-using_insight_to_deepen_love_and_compassion-11956.mp3#t=01:27:17" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">One option is, actually, wipe the slate clean a little bit and say, "I don't _know_ what this thing is." And so it's possible sometimes to leave the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ and just approach the throat, just openly, and just be with those sensations. This is more <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> practice territory, but just be with those sensations in a very light, very delicate way, so you're just holding them. And in a way, in the context of this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, you're just holding them in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>, and just letting them be there, but feeling into them, and seeing if it begins to tell you about an emotion or not. That's one option.</span>

---
##### (2) put attention elsewhere
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^20-7" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^20-7" class="internal-link">20-7</a>**: _<a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11956/20080202-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-using_insight_to_deepen_love_and_compassion-11956.mp3#t=01:27:53" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">The other option in the context of this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> is, "Okay, something going on in the throat - I'll put my <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> elsewhere." And so, another area of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, maybe the heart area or the belly, may actually feel really okay, or comfortable, or even warm and open. And we keep getting dragged into what's a little bit problematic. Like a magnet, we go there. And if possible, just keeping it where it's okay. So they're kind of opposite suggestions, and you can play with them both. In the second one, ==it may be that you can find a place where it's okay, and actually just radiate the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ from there, or feel the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ from there. And eventually, it washes over everything.==</span>

---
##### Keep open to both options
<span class="counts"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^20-8" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^20-8" class="internal-link">20-8</a></span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11956/20080202-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-using_insight_to_deepen_love_and_compassion-11956.mp3#t=01:28:43" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So it's important, I think, to keep open to them both, because sometimes there _is_ something going on emotionally, and we need to connect with it and hold it and explore it. Other times, it's just the way that we've gotten into perceiving and interpreting things, and we need to kind of go away from that. Does that answer? Yeah?</span>

---
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: Yeah, that makes sense. If my arm feels good, I just have to make my arms stronger?</span>

---
##### It's the attention and the enjoyment which allows the awareness to rest
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^21-2" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^21-2" class="internal-link">21-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> (2) · <a data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">Pleasantness</a> · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: That's one option. Rather than making them stronger, it's more like just letting the <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> rest there, and enjoy that they feel good, rather than getting pulled into what feels difficult all the time. It's the <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a> which allows the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> to kind of rest there and get into that more.</span>

#### Q10: concerns that insight might negate _mettā_; connecting with emotions and seeing emptiness as two wings of practice

---
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: I was just thinking that part of my _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice is to introduce or open up just more to my <a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a>. I was just a bit concerned that if I introduce, along with that, the recognition that this is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a> or this is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a>, that might negate that process somehow. Maybe the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ itself could be negated.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Right. Yeah. Very important question. Again, kind of stepping back and taking a big view. If we think, "What's involved in this life of practice? What's involved in the long run in terms of practice?" One wing of it is learning how to open to ourselves, learning how to open to our <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a> - how to be with them, how to acknowledge them, how to feel them, how to respect them, how to connect with them. That's very much a part of what can develop, or what we can rediscover in our practice: really reconnecting with the emotional life and honouring that. That's what I hear you saying.</span>

---
##### A whole other wing is understanding emptiness - birds need two wings
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^21-6" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^21-6" class="internal-link">21-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anatta</a> · <a data-href="Emotions" class="internal-link">Emotions</a> (4)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11956/20080202-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-using_insight_to_deepen_love_and_compassion-11956.mp3#t=01:31:21" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And a whole other wing is this business about <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>. Sometimes, you're quite right that bringing in a reflection of "not me, not mine, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a>," etc., does tend to kind of dissolve whatever emotion is there. Now, it's almost like holding both these wings at once. If all one ever did, or all one ever could do in one's practice is just dissolve <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a>, and one didn't really have the skill and the capacity, or the willingness, or the fearlessness to be with <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a> and feel them, and be able to hold oneself in the <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a>, and connect with one's <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a> - if all one had was <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>, it would be like a bird with one wing trying to fly. It's not going to get anywhere. It's not going to get off the ground, or it will just go round in circles.</span>

##### You may have periods in your life where you're encouraging one more than another
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^21-7" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^21-7" class="internal-link">21-7</a>**: _<a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Emotions" class="internal-link">Emotions</a> (4)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">If all one had was a very beautiful ability to be open with one's emotional life, to connect with it, to respect it, to express it, to hold it, to <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> one's emotional life, to be clear about what's going on in one's emotional life - if all one had was _that_, again, like a bird with just one wing. One is missing the whole other half of practice. I think you're talking about a long term of practice, to really learn to hold these two together and kind of, "Do I understand both? Have I got skill in both? Am I really open to my <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a>, but can I also kind of let go of that whole arena of <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a> and see beyond it in that way?" To have both - again, we're talking about quite a mature practice - is it possible? Absolutely. Some people feel, "Well, I have to do one before I do another." I'm not sure if that's possible. You may have periods in your life where you're encouraging one more than another, and that's fine, and right now might be a period where you're actually wanting to respect the <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a> more and be with the <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a> more, and that's totally fine - in which case, maybe shelve the other stuff for another time.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: It's about, again, what's appropriate and helpful right now for you. In a way, sometimes we need to have an overview and quite a large view of our whole life and practice, which can be difficult, you know. "Where has my life been? Have I been an avoider of <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a>? Have I been too wrapped up and entangled in <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a>?" And then seeing, "What do I know how to do? What do I need to develop?" So you're asking a very big question. Do you see that?</span>

---
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: Yeah. What I'm trying to find out is, where is this <a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a>?</span>

---
##### (1) respect the emotion and feel it
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^22-4" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^22-4" class="internal-link">22-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">Letting go</a> · <a data-href="Emotions" class="internal-link">Emotions</a> (2) · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: You have, again, a couple of options. One is to just know what you're doing at any time, and sometimes say, "I'm just going to really respect the emotion and go into it and feel it, not do anything with it, to accept, feel it, and open to it, and hold myself in that, connect with it." Sometimes you do that. At other times you can explore some of these ways I've talked about <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a>. Sometimes you'll find that beautiful <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a> deepen with that. But more difficult <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a> tend to dissolve. Sometimes you'll find that. But you can have a choice, even on this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, just as long as you know what you're doing when.</span>

---
##### (2) shelve the emotion for later
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > ^22-5" data-href="0202 Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#^22-5" class="internal-link">22-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Or the second option - this is totally valid - is you can just shelve one of them for a while and just say, "I know I need to get to the other one, and I'll get to it sometime, but not on this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>." So both of those would be the <a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a> - the <a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a> meaning aware that ==they're both important in one's life, and one needs to learn how to do both. Without both, the practice hasn't really opened into its maturity.== Exactly how you go about that, you have two options there. Does that make sense? Yeah? Good, okay.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: We're going to get onto this in the third week, but if we just talk about <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>, I'll just say something now. I hope it doesn't confuse. But when you contemplate <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> in certain ways, things disappear. So problematic <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a> disappear; objects disappear from <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>. It's said that only a <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>, only a fully <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightened</a> <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> - not even an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">arahant</a> - just a <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> is able to contemplate <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> and actually keep the object around at the same time. What I meant by "mature practice" was more that we're able to move between different <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a> things. And a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of seeing</a> is just that - it's not ultimately true. It's just a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of seeing</a>. In some instances or some interactions or some inner environments or situations, it's most helpful to see in one way. Here we've had an argument, and you and I have had an argument about something, and there's a difficulty, and I come to you, and I say, "Hey, Elizabeth, it's all empty." You're probably going to punch me. [laughter] ==What certain situations need is very relative, conventional language. We need to talk about our <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a>; we need to express what we feel to each other; we need to respect that. I need to respect my <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a> and your <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a> at that level. So in that moment, that's what's helpful, that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a>. But I'm saying a mature practice is able to move between picking that up, putting it down, picking up other <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a> - <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>, _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>_, etc. - and putting them down, not getting stuck in one or the other.== Does that make sense?</span>

<span class="paragraph">Yogi: That answered my question, Rob.</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Okay, good, good. It's a tall order. Not to underestimate - I'm talking about quite a large span of time that one would develop this in. But it's definitely possible, it's absolutely possible, and it's there, again, as a potential and as a possibility for us as human beings and as practitioners.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Okay. [laughter] We're going to get into this in the third week. So we do a week on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, a week on <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, and a week on what all this has to do with <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> and all that. So usually, when there's something difficult around, an emotion that's difficult, or even a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> sensation that's difficult, or anything that's difficult, we tend to think, "Well, that thing exists, and then I can relate to it in any way that I choose to." Or maybe I can't choose, but I relate to it. So there's a thing, and then the relationship we have with it.</span>

##### When we let go, we're actually taking away some of what is building an experience, and it begins to fade

<span class="paragraph">As we begin to learn to let go of that <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>, for instance, or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a>, or identification, we begin to let go of certain factors, we're actually taking away some of what is building an <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>. And so, it begins to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a>. ==Difficult things are held in place, basically, by <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>, by <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a>, by identification, by all these things we're talking about <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a> of. So as you let go of them, they tend to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a>. <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a>, at one level, or peace, or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, is also held in place by <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a>, to an extent. But it's a more subtle kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a>. What one finds is that if one lets go of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a> towards <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>, the <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> actually deepens. It becomes more refined.== So it goes from, for instance, a very sort of bubbly <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> to a more peaceful <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>. It's dependent - because we're not holding it in place by the way we're looking and relating. Does that make sense, or have I confused ...? No? Okay. We're going to talk a lot about this in the third week.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Well, ultimately, no. That's what all this is pointing to: nothing exists in a way outside of one's self, outside of what one's bringing to that. ==So it's a different question than, "If a tree falls in the forest, and there's no one around, does it make a noise?" It's not going there, to that question. It's avoiding that question. We're talking about <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> in the light of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> arising or not.== So it's very personal, experiential, very real for us.

Yeah, same, same. It can be really helpful as a concept: "My <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is all over the place.

That's part of what we tend to call "<a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a>," and the assumption is that there is such a thing and that one can get to a point where one is not colouring objects in any way, and then one has arrived at, "That's how the object really is. That's how it is. This is it. This is _things as they are_," which is also a phrase that's very popular in the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, "things as they are," and actually a phrase that the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> used.

##### There is no moment of consciousness that is not shaping or creating or colouring or fabricating an experience

<span class="paragraph">Rather, what he meant - "things as they are" - you cannot find a <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>, a state of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, a moment of <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>, that is not shaping or creating or colouring or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricating</a> an <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>. We tend to think, "Well, <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> is this sort of midpoint where you've got rid of all this other stuff." Or we think, "Yeah, <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> is that." But when you really go into it, there's no such thing. ==The very <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a> of <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> itself is that it's always creating an object and shaping, colouring - '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricating</a>' is the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s word - <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricating</a> an object. As such, there is no place to stand where you see a thing as it is _independently of the way I'm looking at it_.== What we're doing in this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, what we're leading up towards, is using <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> as a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of seeing</a> that.

##### The whole nature of perception begins to be unravelled

<span class="paragraph">Rob: The whole level of it, as you go deeper into it, the whole <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a> of <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a> begins to be unravelled, and the assumption that things exist independent of the way we're looking at them is seen to be a falsehood. It's just not true. To understand that, that's what it means to understand <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>. That's exactly what it means, and that's what the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> taught: liberating <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>. That's exactly what he taught, what he meant. ==So when the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> uses the words "things as they are," what he means, what he meant, was "things as they are" - it's _dependent_, dependent co-arising. They don't exist independently.== To see a thing as it is means to really recognize - and again, totally in one's heart, one really knows - that it doesn't exist independently. We struggle with things in life partly because we believe that they exist independently: "This knee <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a> - that's _really_ what it is. It really hurts. It really hurts exactly this amount. It's not that bad, but it's quite bad." And we believe it exists independently, and then we struggle with things. ==At a very deep level, when we begin to undermine that belief in the independent existence of things, then our whole sense of reality is opened up. It's almost as if <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> can't land anywhere; we can't land anywhere to struggle with anything. Or we believe that less and less, put it that way. And then comes more and more a sense of <a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a>, and <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> comes.== It will become clearer in time what the <a data-href="hell" class="internal-link">hell</a> this has got to do with <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. But there's a reason we put it at the third week. But it's coming up now, and it's fine. We're moving in that direction.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So, _if_ there's someone who doesn't understand this right now ... [laughs] Just kidding. If you ... [laughter] If this isn't totally crystal clear right now, don't worry. Going back to - I think I started the talk on _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ saying, when we were conceiving of this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, I had a good think about it and thought, "What's a person going to get out of this?" You can't go wrong. So it may be that we get to the end of the three weeks, and all this stuff about <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> is "I've got it." [snaps fingers] "I've really understood." Great. Fantastic. I really hope that's the case. It may be that it didn't _quite_ ... That's okay too. You'll still have developed the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. It's still moving towards <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a>. And still there will have been the development of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_. It's all in there. You cannot fail here. And we're not grading people either, so ... [laughter] We're going to talk about it more and more. It will come together.</span>
