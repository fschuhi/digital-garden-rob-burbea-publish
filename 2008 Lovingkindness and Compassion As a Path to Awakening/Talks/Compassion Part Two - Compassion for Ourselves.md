##### Today we add the compassion to the self
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^1-1" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^1-1" class="internal-link">1-1</a>**: _<a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> (3) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=00:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">I was perhaps a little even more long-winded than usual last night, and as a result there were a couple of things I left out, which I just want to touch on today. Today we add [[the self]], [[compassion]] to [[the self]]. So we keep [[compassion]] to the person who is obviously <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, and we add [[compassion]] to [[the self]]. I'm going to speak a bit about that, which should have gone in the talk last night had I not been so long-winded. Actually, there's an old Jewish proverb that says, "Why say something in twenty words when you can say it in two thousand?" [laughter]</span>

##### "It seems unfair to give compassion to myself, others suffer much more!"
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^1-2" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (4)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=00:51" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">When we move on to [[compassion]] for [[the self]], very, very common, this is very common: we've just been with someone obviously <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, and the feeling that comes up or the reaction that comes up, and it's understandable, can be, "But I look at myself, and I just see others in the world are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> much more. I'm aware of my <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, but when I compare that to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> that I know of in the world, that I read about, that I hear about, it seems unfair to stay with myself and give the [[compassion]] to myself." This is extremely common.</span>

##### Story: leprosy community in Indea
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^1-3" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (4)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=01:35" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">I remember taking a month with some <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> friends, and working at a leprosy community in India, and having a long conversation on the long train trip down from Delhi with a friend. And she had done a lot of service work from a very young age, and was sort of saying that service was really much more needed in the Third World, etc., and it was pointless relating to sort of white middle-class people in the West, etc. But we had a long conversation, and then going to this leprosy community and actually seeing how much <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> there was there - it was quite striking. People with leprosy, and recovering from leprosy, or having recovered from leprosy - a tremendous amount of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> there. And we had this sort of ongoing conversation and comparing that to some of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> that's around in the West. I really don't want to polarize East and West here, but ==sometimes where we think the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> is isn't always where it is, in the most obvious sense. And anyway, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> is not measurable.== This is something we'll come back to. But <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> is not measurable.</span>

---
##### This suffering here is the one we can be most intimate with
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^1-4" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3) · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (5) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (3)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=02:53" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">But this reaction, "Others suffer much more" - extremely common. Sometimes it's just a habitual way of viewing, a habitual <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of seeing</a> ourselves and thinking. There's something - well, there are a lot of things really crucial about [[compassion]] to [[the self]]. One of them is that this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> here is the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> that we can be most intimate with. And because of that, there's the potential that we can actually learn most from it, in terms of, how does <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> arise? Remember, that's the fundamental question of [[insight]], of _paññā_, of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a>. ==So because we're most intimate with this psychophysical organism, that's where we learn the most. And that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> then translates and transfers into [[compassion]] for others, because we understand the roots of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. The more we understand the roots of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, the more [[compassion]] there can be for all beings.==</span>

##### Compassion for oneself is tremendously healing
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^1-5" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^1-5" class="internal-link">1-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Healing" class="internal-link">Healing</a> (4) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=03:55" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph"><a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> for oneself - tremendously [[healing]]. Really, really important levels of [[healing]] there. And it comes in lots of different ways. It comes, of course, through _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ to ourselves, through [[compassion]] to ourselves, but also through the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, to whatever extent it's there. Just the calming of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, the calming of the [[mind]], brings a [[healing]]. I can actually feel a [[healing]] going on sometimes. And also through [[insight]], as I just said.</span>

---
##### There's also enjoyment in compassion practice
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^2-1" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3) · <a data-href="Empathy" class="internal-link">Empathy</a> · <a data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">Pleasantness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Healing" class="internal-link">Healing</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=04:25" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So this practice of [[compassion]] and [[compassion]] to oneself - you can actually enjoy it. And like I said last night, it doesn't have to be always heavy. Sometimes it feels, you know, the heart is reverberating with [[empathy]], and it can feel - not heavy, but just poignant, definitely. But there's also an <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a> in [[compassion]] practice that's available. And that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a> is very much part of the [[healing]], as much as the being moved and the being touched.</span>

##### Balance of empathy and giving is so important
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^2-2" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Empathy" class="internal-link">Empathy</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=04:58" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">This aspect, and I mentioned it, I think - well, definitely last night, and maybe even before - this balancing of the [[empathy]] and the giving, this is so important. Do I need to go over it again? I'm really happy to explain it again if people are not quite sure what that means yet.</span>

---
<span class="paragraph">**Yogi**: Could you explain the difference between [[empathy]] and sympathy? Because I get those muddled.</span>
<span class="paragraph">**Rob**: I'm not sure I know.</span>
<span class="paragraph">**Yogi 2**: Think sympathy's got a bit of [[pity]] with it.</span>

---
##### "Sympathy" in English has connotations of pity
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^2-6" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^2-6" class="internal-link">2-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Pity" class="internal-link">Pity</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=05:30" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**Rob**: Okay, maybe that's right. Thank you, Frances. Maybe in English usage of the word 'sympathy' has come to mean something which evokes a sense of [[pity]], which has a sense of distance and somewhat looking down. I don't know whether it originally meant that. Just, you know, 'sym-pathy' - it doesn't imply that. But it's probably come to have been injected a little bit with that.</span>

---
##### Biblical origin of "pity"
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^2-7" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^2-7" class="internal-link">2-7</a>**: _<a data-href="Pity" class="internal-link">Pity</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=05:57" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**Yogi 3**: I was wondering about our look at this word '[[pity]],' whether that's something to do with a Western approach rather than the original maybe biblical terms. May have _been_ [[compassion]], but we've interpreted it as something from a distance, you know, something we look at from a distance.</span>

---
##### "Pity" points to being a bit distant, aloof
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^2-8" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^2-8" class="internal-link">2-8</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=06:20" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**Rob**: Yeah, very possibly. Yeah, and probably originally the word meant something much more like [[compassion]]. But that feeling might still have arisen for people. And so I just want to use words to separate out what one might notice in one's practice when one's a bit distant, a bit aloof, a bit almost superior.</span>

---
##### Feeling in the body the loveliness of giving is a way to make the compassion sustainable
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^2-9" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^2-9" class="internal-link">2-9</a>**: _<a data-href="Empathy" class="internal-link">Empathy</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=06:39" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">But this piece about balancing our [[empathy]], how we're resonating, how we're feeling the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, opening to it, taking it in, and balancing that with the giving out. And tasting, feeling in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> the loveliness of what we give out as a way of making the [[compassion]] sustainable.</span>

---
##### Different from insight practice, in compassion practice one is more interest in what is around the pain, not in the center of it
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^2-10" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^2-10" class="internal-link">2-10</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Pain" class="internal-link">Pain</a> (6) · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">Centre</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=07:05" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">When we come to [[compassion]] for our self, in a way, this balance and this process still applies. Usually in [[insight]] practice, when we have a [[pain]] - emotional or physical or mental, whatever it is - the instructions, part of the instructions, are to really go into the [[pain]], and really feel it in a very bare way, open oneself to it, get into the texture of it, be right there with it. And so, quite standard <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a> instructions - very useful, very powerful, very beautiful. Slightly different emphasis with [[compassion]] to oneself, in that one is aware of the [[pain]], whatever it is - emotional hurt, physical [[pain]], whatever - but it's almost as if that's at the [[centre]] of something. And one is conscious of it. One's feeling it. One's even feeling the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> of it. ==But in a way, one's more interested in what's _around_ that, in the - someone in their note, beautifully put - the _holding_ that goes _around_ the [[pain]]. So it's as if this [[pain]] is at the [[centre]]. And we're not denying it. We're still feeling it, but we're not going right into it. We're more interested in the warmth and the tenderness and the holding that's around it.== And the [[attention]] is a little bit more even in that. So it's, again, picking up on this quality of what's bathing, what's giving, what's going out.</span>

##### Compassion to self does not build the ego
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^3-1" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^3-1" class="internal-link">3-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> (3) · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> (4) · <a data-href="Acceptance" class="internal-link">Acceptance</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> · <a data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">Spaciousness</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=08:36" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Another issue that can come up when we give either _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ or [[compassion]] to myself is the question, "Am I feeding my ego? If I spend too long just relating to myself with [[love]] and [[compassion]], am I perhaps feeding the ego and feeding this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a>?" Good question. But when we look carefully, we actually see that the ego-sense is dependent on the _wrong_ kind of [[attention]] to [[the self]] - on an obsession, or judgmentalism, or criticism, or that kind of thing. ==A wrong kind of self-[[attention]] feeds, builds the ego and builds [[the self]]-sense, whereas an [[attention]] that's full of [[compassion]], full of tenderness, full of [[acceptance]] and care, full of [[insight]] into questioning, "How is it that this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> has come about?" - that kind of direction of the [[attention]] towards self does not build the ego, will not build the ego, will actually soften things, will actually allow things to become looser and more spacious.==</span>

##### Compassion is a lighter energy than metta, so phrases can be used more lightly

<span class="paragraph">And as I said before, when there's a lack of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love" data-href="Love" class="internal-link">self-love</a>, we tend to look out for <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a>. We look outwards, in a way, too much, in an off-balance way. And somehow that actually _also_ feeds [[the self]]. So there's a basic practice for [[compassion]] to oneself: just using the phrases, using the intention, feeling that [[energy]]. And just a word here in response to someone's note, actually, to repeat something I said: [[compassion]], I feel - not everyone will feel this, but some people will definitely feel this - [[compassion]] is a lighter [[energy]]. It _can_ be a little more subtle. So what that might mean is you might want to really back off on the phrases. Some people don't want to use any phrases at all with [[compassion]], because it's more delicate. ==Some people just use the phrases much more lightly, and this allows the sense of drawing close to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, of [[empathy]], and also of giving. So play with that. Play with how heavily and tightly you hold the phrases.==</span>

##### Two more possibilities

<span class="paragraph">Okay, so there's the basic practice of [[compassion]] to oneself and all the lovely [[healing]], the [[beauty]] of the [[healing]] that's involved in that. There are two more possibilities I just want to put out there. Again, some of you will be interested, and some, it's fine to just let these go. But I want to put them out.</span>

#### (1) Use the climate of compassion as a lense
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^3-4" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^3-4" class="internal-link">3-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (5) · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=11:36" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(1)** Sometimes we're directing the [[compassion]] towards our self, and we're actually not feeling much <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in that moment. There's nothing particularly dramatic going on. There's no big <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the here and now. But **because of the practice, there can be a _climate_ of [[compassion]]**. It's as if there's a softness and tenderness come into the inner climate, and some degree of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, of settling - it doesn't have to be a big deal - some degree of settling. And perhaps one's gone down to one word or one phrase and just really simplified and lightened the practice. There's no particular, dramatic <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, but something quite powerful is potentially possible here. You can **use that whole climate and the practice as a kind of lens to look at one's [[experience]] in the moment, and to see any kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, any kind of subtle <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, and to unhook it**.</span>

##### The lens of compassion is used to tune into any subtle manifestation of suffering
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^3-5" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^3-5" class="internal-link">3-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (4) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (2) · <a data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">Clinging</a> · <a data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">Letting go</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=12:34" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So one's actually using a kind of [[insight]] practice through the lens of [[compassion]], in a way that the lens of [[compassion]] is tuning one into any subtle manifestation of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. And what can happen because of the [[compassion]] is one sees these subtle sufferings, and it just unhooks organically. ==One sees what one's doing, what one's [[clinging]] to right there and then, and it just can unhook it - because there's this attunement to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, because of the [[compassion]] practice.== And there's a natural [[letting go]], can be a natural [[letting go]].</span>

##### Somehow in the seeing and the softness, it just unhooks
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^4-1" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^4-1" class="internal-link">4-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (3) · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=13:13" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">This can be a very, very beautiful and powerful way of practising. It tends to kind of consolidate whatever <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a> we've already had. So one might have - I mean, it can be anything - just the [[insight]] that when I get too involved in story, and I build up my <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> through the story, I'm actually creating more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. We've all seen how [[consciousness]] can do that. We get too - we drag in the past and the future and the story, and we build <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. So in this climate of [[compassion]], relatively calm, one sees the beginnings of that. And somehow in the seeing and the softness, it just unhooks. It just unhooks.</span>

##### This way there is a bit more openness in the compassion practice
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^4-2" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^4-2" class="internal-link">4-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (2) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (4) · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a> (2) · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=13:54" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">It consolidates our previous <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a> of seeing that story-building is _usually_, not always, but usually unhelpful. Or could be just we sense we've moved out of the here and now, we've moved out of an immediate presence. So in this way of using [[compassion]] practice, there's a bit more openness to what's actually going on in the moment. It's not just tunnelled into the phrases in the [[compassion]]. It's a bit more open, and the [[compassion]] is embracing the [[experience]] in the moment. Could be we just sense we've closed down, the heart's just closed, and we don't need to. And again, the climate allows it to open. Or we feel we're <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a> at something. And we're just aware of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a>. And again, the lens of [[compassion]] sees it and can just let it go. But it can be any range of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a>. Identification - we see that we're identified with something. If one has the practice, we see, "Ah, I'm not seeing the [[emptiness]] of something. I'm believing in something's inherent existence, whatever it is" - can be a whole range of subtlety here. It's all there, possible.</span>

##### Beautiful mix of insight and compassion practice
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^4-3" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^4-3" class="internal-link">4-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (2) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So again, just putting this out as a possibility. As a way of practice, it's actually a very beautiful kind of mix of [[insight]] practice and [[compassion]] practice, very lovely way to go about doing [[insight]] practice, and a way of deepening and expanding the [[compassion]] practice.</span>

#### (2) Compassion to self is compassion to mind moments
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^4-4" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^4-4" class="internal-link">4-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (4) · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> (2) · <a data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">Steadiness</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (6) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (3) · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=15:20" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(2)** Second possibility - and it's just a possibility - giving the [[compassion]] to [[the self]], and as the calming deepens or in moments of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a>, we look inside at what we're giving the [[compassion]] to, and it can sometimes seem, or sometimes becomes clear, that this is really **[[compassion]] to [[mind]] moments**. So when I give [[compassion]] to myself and there's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> - big <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> or little <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> - what I'm really encountering is moments of [[mind]], moments of [[awareness]] with something going on in them. ==Not a self - I don't ever encounter a self. What I encounter is moments of [[mind]] with something happening in that [[mind]] moment, moments of awareness.== Or you could say [[the self]] that I encounter is just really [[mind]] moments. It's just [[mind]] moments.</span>

##### This frees up the sense of self, which frees up more compassion
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^4-5" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^4-5" class="internal-link">4-5</a>**: _<a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> (3) · <a data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">Spaciousness</a> (3) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (4) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11949/20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=16:19" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">What this can do, what it _does_ do when we see this, is it frees up the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a>. Again, instead of a solid <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a> - my independent, fixed, solid self - it frees it up in a way that's very <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a>, can be very <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a>. And in so doing, it frees up more [[compassion]]. The more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a> this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a>, the more [[compassion]]. And once we've seen that in ourselves, we can actually do that to another. So we're giving [[compassion]] to someone else. Who am I giving [[compassion]] to? There's no one there. It's just [[mind]] moments, with something happening in the [[mind]] moment.</span>

##### Giving compassion to ownerless mind moments
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > ^4-6" data-href="0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^4-6" class="internal-link">4-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (4) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2) · <a data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">Anatta</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So in a way, we're giving [[compassion]] to ownerless [[mind]] moments, [[mind]] moments that have no owner. This is another way into the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">anattā</a>_, this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a> business. ==And the paradox is there: the less the receiver of [[compassion]], and the less the giver of [[compassion]], the more [[compassion]] there is. How odd!==</span>

##### "If you want to dig a well for water, dig one hole and dig it deep

<span class="paragraph">But these are just suggestions, and take them on if you want to explore. By all means, take them on if they feel useful. Otherwise just let them go. File them for another time, whatever. It's fine. The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> has a phrase: "If you're digging for water, if you want to dig a well for water, dig one hole and dig it deep. Don't dig lots of little holes - you're not going to get enough." So the same with all these possibilities. Just take one or two things that seem, "Ah yeah, maybe I can work with that," and dig deep with them. See what happens. Keep the rest for another time.</span>
