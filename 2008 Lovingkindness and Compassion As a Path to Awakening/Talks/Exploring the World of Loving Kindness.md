##### This talk is about the dimensions we uncover when practicing metta
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > ^1-1" data-href="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#^1-1" class="internal-link">1-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">Dimensionality</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11951/20080130-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-exploring_the_world_of_loving_kindness-11951.mp3#t=00:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Tonight I'd like to talk about some of the aspects of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, some of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a> that we begin to uncover, begin to feel, when we explore, when we move into this practice.</span>

##### Metta can never just be a feeling
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > ^1-2" data-href="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">Devotion</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11951/20080130-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-exploring_the_world_of_loving_kindness-11951.mp3#t=00:21" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So, to reiterate something we've already said a few times: to remember that _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ can never just be a feeling. Sometimes we are just having that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a> in planting the seeds, seeds of intentionality, and how profound - very simple but profound that is, and powerful.</span>

---
##### It's more a constellation of feelings
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > ^1-3" data-href="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (6) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (2) · <a data-href="Feelings" class="internal-link">Feelings</a> · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11951/20080130-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-exploring_the_world_of_loving_kindness-11951.mp3#t=00:48" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">But even when _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ _is_ felt as a feeling - and we have a _feeling_ of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> - even then, it's not just one feeling. And I sort of mentioned this in the morning instructions the other day. And you may have noticed this in your practice. In those moments, in those times when there is a feeling, there is something felt, in the heart, or in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, might _more_ accurately talk about a constellation of <a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a>. So sometimes the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ feels warm. It's felt as a warmth. Sometimes it's a kind of bubbly feeling. There's a <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> with it. Sometimes it's very soothing. Sometimes calming. Sometimes it's very bright, very luminous. Sometimes very gentle. And the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, the felt <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, can go through all those different textures, different colours, different flavours. It's actually important to feel that. ==And this is partly why we keep encouraging this sensitivity that's developed in your practice, particularly sensitivity to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, and just actually _allowing_ the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ to take these subtly different flavours, at times. Sometimes, when it has that feeling, to go through that, and really just allowing that.==</span>

##### We need to discriminate between metta and compassion
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > ^1-4" data-href="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (7) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (3) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (4) · <a data-href="Feelings" class="internal-link">Feelings</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11951/20080130-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-exploring_the_world_of_loving_kindness-11951.mp3#t=02:27" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And you may also have noticed, many of you may also have noticed by now, sometimes one's doing _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ to oneself, or _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ to the friend or the benefactor, and we are conscious of our <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> or their <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, and the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ takes on the colour, the flavour, of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> at that point. So, certainly, we need to discriminate between these two, between _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, and be quite specific and precise about what is _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ and what is <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. But they also overlap. And when the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, as many of you will have experienced already, when it touches <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, it has the flavour of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. And just to allow that, just to allow that. It's part of the constellation of <a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a> that _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ is.</span>

##### Categories of people we direct metta to are not inherently fixed
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > ^1-6" data-href="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#^1-6" class="internal-link">1-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Feelings" class="internal-link">Feelings</a> · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11951/20080130-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-exploring_the_world_of_loving_kindness-11951.mp3#t=03:41" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So, there's a constellation of possible <a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a>. And we go through these categories. We're beginning to unfold these categories. And so, we have <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>, the benefactor, the friend, etc. And it's important to recognize that these categories are not fixed. Someone is not _inherently_ a friend, or _inherently_ - later we'll do the difficult person, or neutral - that they're very fluid categories. So someone might be a benefactor or a friend, in that category, and then they say the wrong thing to us. [laughter] And you know, they get relegated a couple of divisions. [laughter] And hopefully, you heal that, and they get promoted again. [laughter]</span>

---
##### Having categories is a technique to extend the range of metta towards boundlessness
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > ^1-7" data-href="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#^1-7" class="internal-link">1-7</a>**: _<a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11951/20080130-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-exploring_the_world_of_loving_kindness-11951.mp3#t=04:46" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">But they're not - there is nothing fixed. The whole practice is very fluid. The reason for the categories - it's just a technique to gradually extend the range of the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ towards this boundlessness, which is the aspiration of the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_. So it's just a tool.</span>

---
##### Due to our cultural background, it can be difficult to orient metta towards the self
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > ^2-1" data-href="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> (2) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11951/20080130-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-exploring_the_world_of_loving_kindness-11951.mp3#t=05:03" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And we start with <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>, and we've spent two days with that. This has already been said, but just to say it again: how common it is, actually, for that to be quite a difficult orientation for the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_. Difficult to direct the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ towards <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> - not for everyone, but it's really quite common. And there are all kinds of reasons for this. We can talk about childhood and family and school, and many, many possible reasons. And a lot of it, in fact, is just cultural. Sometimes, looking at the culture we're in at the moment, it's almost like there's a bit of a mixed message out there, about how one is in relationship to oneself. In many respects, perhaps looking at the culture, we can see that we're in a bit of a culture of selfishness: "me first." Maybe a few people around me, but "me first." And somehow with that, the message from the culture - and sometimes it's not even overt - the message is, "To <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> oneself, to cherish oneself in a healthy way, is somehow selfish." There's quite a confusing message, just that we're getting from the culture.</span>

##### We might even have the view that it is selfish
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > ^2-2" data-href="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11951/20080130-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-exploring_the_world_of_loving_kindness-11951.mp3#t=06:24" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">But in a way, whatever the reasons (and it can be quite complex), we often, or many people find themselves in a situation where it's quite difficult to direct the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> towards themselves, the intention of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> towards themselves. Or even to have an idea or a belief, a view, that it's not a good idea, that it's selfish. And just to have that view.</span>

##### Metta weakens the unhelpful habits of (not) relating to our self
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > ^2-3" data-href="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">Habit</a> (5) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a> · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11951/20080130-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-exploring_the_world_of_loving_kindness-11951.mp3#t=06:50" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">All of that - quite complex, the reasons for it, but _might_ be just a <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a>, might have just become a <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a> of viewing, a <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a> of a way of relating to our self, or a way of not relating to our self. And as such, one of the functions of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice is just to weaken that <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a>. Again, it's not a very glamorous <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a> at the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, but it's extremely powerful: we're just weakening <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a> that are unhelpful.</span>

##### Metta towards ourselves is necessary for our practice
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > ^2-4" data-href="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#^2-4" class="internal-link">2-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">And it's so necessary, so necessary for our lives, for our path, for our practice, to be in the context of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> for oneself. That is the inner climate of the way we're moving through our life, and the way we're moving through our practice. So necessary. And just to repeat, actually, that quote from the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> again, so powerful :</span>

<span class="paragraph">You could search the entire universe for someone more deserving of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> than yourself, and you will not find that person.

<span class="paragraph">Something to really reflect on. It's not about what we think we deserve. It's not about what we think we've done, or how we think we measure up. What we haven't done, what we've said, what we didn't say, what goes through our minds, what we think of ourselves - we're saying all of that's actually irrelevant. ==Just the fact of your being means that you deserve it. And to give the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> to ourselves is actually a gift to others, begins to become a foundation from which we can give to others, and actually, an indispensable foundation for making that a steady and a deep giving that lasts.==</span>

##### Near enemy of metta is attached love

<span class="paragraph">**Rob**: Well, okay. '<a data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">Near enemy</a>' is a bit of a strange concept that comes from the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>, actually.^[The concept of a 'near enemy' of _mettā_ seems to originate from post-canonical Pali texts. See Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa, _The Path of Purification: Visuddhimagga_, tr. Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli (Onalaska, WA: Pariyatti, 1999), 311] And what it means is something that _looks_ like <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, _looks_ like <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, but isn't. It's pretty close, but it isn't. And the <a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a> of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, is _attached <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>_. Now, we all have experienced that. It's not unconditional <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. ==So _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ in its aspiration is: it doesn't matter what you do, what you give me back, what you say, whether you're grateful, what you've done, whether I like you - none of that. It's unconditional. But usually, there are strings and conditions attached to our <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, and it's actually attached love.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">This is very important, because what we find when we begin exploring for ourselves what _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ means, what we run into is a lot of this <a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a> stuff, a lot of attached <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>.

<span class="paragraph">We practise with the totality of our humanity. That's what we are, and that's what we bring to practice, and that's what we practise with. And as human beings, of course, well, we are human. We are complex. A lot of our <a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a> and intentions - there's quite a messiness there. And in a way, that messiness is the stuff of our humanity. And so it's important to enlarge the picture of the practice and just include all that. We're going to run into these <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Near enemy" data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemies</a>. No question about it.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And they're actually part of the practice. So not to see them as, "Oh, I give up," you know, or "Oh, I'm not doing it right." They're actually part of the practice, to encounter attached <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, in the <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>, in the walking, as you go about the day, in your interactions with people. It's part of the practice, and actually a necessary part of the practice, because it's through that that we learn about what '<a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a>' is, but we also learn what pure _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ is. Without the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Near enemy" data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemies</a>, we could never make that journey of learning. So not to regard it as a kind of failure, or "I'm not getting it right." This is a learning process as much as anything else. And one's beginning to see the different aspects.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So today we introduced the friend, the category of the friend. And so to reflect a little bit - I mean, each of us, I think this is really important in our lives, to reflect: what does it mean to be a friend? What does it mean to be a good friend in this life? And actually, there are a lot of aspects just to that.</span>

##### Friendship means to have the aspiration to keep seeing each other
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > ^3-6" data-href="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#^3-6" class="internal-link">3-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Jiddu Krishnamurti" class="internal-link">Jiddu Krishnamurti</a> · <a data-href="Relationships" class="internal-link">Relationships</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11951/20080130-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-exploring_the_world_of_loving_kindness-11951.mp3#t=12:16" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Part of it is _seeing_ another. Do we _see_ our friend? Do we really _see_ them? <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jiddu Krishnamurti" data-href="Jiddu Krishnamurti" class="internal-link">Krishnamurti</a> used to talk about this a lot - how easy it is to just habituate oneself to another, especially when we're very familiar or very intimate with them. And we begin almost to not see them freshly. So I would say an aspiration of friendship, or what friendship means, is to have the aspiration to keep seeing another, to keep seeing them, to keep that fresh, open, not to put another in a box. This goes on all the time, in the best of our friendships. It goes on all the time. And it's just a matter of admitting that to ourselves. And again, what does it mean to be a good friend? ==It means to care about that, and to try and keep breaking that open, and having it be fresh. And that's quite a task. I think it's quite a task. And especially, you know, <a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a>, friendships, intimate <a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a> that last years - how easy it is to just gloss over the other with time, with familiarity.==</span>

##### It's ok that we also want to be seen by the other
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness > ^3-7" data-href="0130 Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#^3-7" class="internal-link">3-7</a>**: _<a data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Awakening</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So that's part of what friendship means, that aspiration. But this is where our humanity comes in. Also, let's be realistic. If I'm friends with someone, perhaps until we are completely <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">enlightened</a>, completely awakened, I'm also, as much as I want to see the other, I'm going to want to be seen. So that's already attached. You know, there are already some strings attached there. I would say, in the context of a friendship, that's okay. That's part of what it is.</span>

<span class="paragraph">What we've got here is something quite human and complex, and not, perhaps, quite the stainless picture that we might at first see, that might at first seem the case when we come to _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice. We want to be seen, and it's a beautiful thing to feel like you are being seen by a friend. And perhaps that's a necessary part of our friendships, and a necessary part of our humanity. How does it feel in a friendship when we don't feel seen? We see the other, we try to see the other, we want to be seen, we need to be seen, and we also need to want to see ourselves. How am I in this relationship? I'm interacting - what's going on for me? What are my intentions? What are my <a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a>? So we see ourselves, too, and that's equally important. We talk about what is friendship, what makes good friendship.</span>

<span class="paragraph">We appreciate the other in a friendship. There is <a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a> for who they are, for how they are, for what they do, for their manifestation. And hopefully there is the willingness and the ability to express that. And this is something we all need to look into: do I hold back my voicing of <a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a> in the <a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a> that I'm in? How easy it is to get into that pattern, and just a little bit inhibited in doing that.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And conversely, again, we take in <a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a>. And again, this is a very interesting one. How many of us - is it actually quite difficult? We have someone who loves us, and they're expressing <a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a>, and some wall comes up over the heart, just can't take it in. It just bounces right off. How common this is. And again, to appreciate oneself - all this is part of what friendship is. Or rather, I would say, friendship is the commitment to growing in all of that, and to uncovering all of that, to discovering all of that.</span>

##### Reparenting ourselves

<span class="paragraph">So I think it's fair to say there's a kind of level of practice, or a dimension of practice, that's really about reparenting ourselves. I mean, that's a way of putting it. Sometimes, for some people, literally, the parents did not provide enough of what was needed. And there is, in a way, a very real reparenting that goes on, very gradually, over months and years. And that's one of the functions - not totally, not the complete practice - one of the functions of practice, this reparenting.</span>

Like, the <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a> - squeaky clean _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ machine. It somehow doesn't feel very human - _sometimes_, _some_ of the references. And there's a way that it can feel like it excludes or precludes our personality, our self-expression, our uniqueness.

This is really a question for us as practitioners: are we really willing, _fully_ willing, to work with that messiness in our lives, to work with that complexity, to work with our humanity in the context of our friendships, of our <a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a>? And sometimes we think we are, but if we take a real honest look, the truth is - well, there's a lot of places that we just, "Hmph," actually can't really be bothered to go there. Are we willing to work with the fullness of our life, and have, in that sense, a very full practice?</span>

<span class="paragraph">This is very interesting. Can be at that point in the practice, that this is where we just ... [mimes falling asleep] [laughter] The very neutrality means there is nothing in it for us. It becomes a bit abstract. We lose interest. It feels removed. But that effect in itself is actually quite interesting. What is it that makes us lose interest in people? What is it that makes them, makes most of humanity, perhaps - it's interesting: for some people, no one is neutral; there's always some kind of tussle. But what is it that allows people to kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a> to the background for us?

<span class="paragraph">When we're struggling with something, when <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> is struggling with something, we're in a tizzy about something, either <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">wanting to get rid of</a> something, pushing something away, or trying to hold on to something, trying to grasp - when there is <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a> (in <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> shorthand), the more <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a> there is, the more the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a>. And what one has then is a very prominent <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a> and a prominent sense of one thing that one's in a bit of a tizzy about.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a> _builds_ self. This is another way of saying self is empty. It depends on our <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a>. It depends on us struggling with something in some way. The more we struggle, the more built up <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> is. And you have <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>, and you have _one thing_ with which one is <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a> or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a> to some degree, and everything else, every_one_ else, just fades: "Not interested right now."

Everyone else fades to grey: "Not interested." We really need to see this. We need to see this process. What's happening?

<span class="paragraph">So in the context of this, when we have difficulty with someone, whether they were a friend or it's just someone on the street that we don't know, whatever it is, it's actually important to look and really, with care, investigate our relationship to expressing <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>, expressing "no."

<span class="paragraph">Sometimes, and this, again, is quite common, there's a real <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> of doing that, <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> of saying "no," a <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> of standing in one's truth and speaking it, <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> of expressing <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> - very common. I have a very good friend. She suffers from quite severe <a data-href="depression" class="internal-link">depression</a> at times. And she's beginning to notice this relationship - it's only part of what goes on for her, and <a data-href="depression" class="internal-link">depression</a> itself is quite complex, so it's only a strand. But she's beginning to notice that there are times when something happens with someone, and she's angry. Something goes on that she's really angry about, and she feels so fearful of expressing the <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>. She's just beginning to be aware of this now: she turns it in on herself. The next thing she knows, she's in a state of <a data-href="depression" class="internal-link">depression</a> (which is one of the possibilities of what can happen here). And in her case, it's doubly tragic because, I feel that she's someone with a very natural, very naturally, very deep _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>.

<span class="paragraph">**(1)** It's usually **blind to its causes**. So usually something happens, we get angry, and we say, "_You_ are making me angry," or "_This_ is making me angry." And what we don't see in that - it seems so obvious; ==what we don't see is the whole inner constellation, or both inner and outer constellation of conditions that allow the <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> to be.== All kinds of assumptions, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a>, views, thoughts. What was the state of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> before the <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>? Perhaps there was a little bit of irritability and leaning that way anyway. <a data-href="Anger" class="internal-link">Anger</a> comes, and it becomes blind to its causes, and wants to put it on one thing. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma practice</a> means to uncover that.

##### Blind to its effects - - Story: punching bag

<span class="paragraph">**(2)** Also often **blind to its effects**. <a data-href="Anger" class="internal-link">Anger</a> is blind to its effects - so both energetically and on others, and I'll explain what I mean. When was it? Twenty? More than twenty. Around twenty years ago, I had just started a psychotherapy process, working in psychotherapy with a therapist in America. And it was quite early days, and she said, and it seemed clear, there is obviously some <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> there, needs addressing, needs to come out. Get it out. And so she suggested: go to the gym, and get one of those big punchbags, and pummel, pummel the punchbag, and be with that process of the <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> expressing itself.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So I dutifully did that, for quite a while. Huge! [gesturing size of punchbag] [laughs] And what I noticed was that I would punch this thing, and <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> would indeed come up, and I'd punch away at it really hard. What happened was that the more I punched, and the more _into_ it I got, the more <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> came up. So I thought, "Ah, now we're really liberating some stuff." [laughter] And I went, really going for it. And I was quite young. Going to the extent that my knuckles - I was actually wearing boxing gloves, but my knuckles were still bleeding underneath. So I was a very _eager_ client. [laughter] After a certain point, something occurred to me. [laughter] Maybe this is actually _building_ it and not _releasing_ it, which would be the assumption.</span>

<span class="paragraph"><a data-href="Anger" class="internal-link">Anger</a> can be blind to its effects. What's going on? We tend to think, "There's such a pressure inside. It needs to release. I need to get it out. It's like a heat, a burning. Get it out! And then, when I get it out I'll feel better." Even if we don't consciously think that, is that the case, always? It can be blind to its effects.</span>

<span class="paragraph">It can also be blind to its effects on others. So again, we say, we _voice_ our <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>, we _vent_ our <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> at someone. And really what we want is for the situation to change, or part of what we want. And yet, I think ==it takes an extraordinarily evolved <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a> to have <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> flung at them, energetically, that level of <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>, and not to react.== Just energetically, it's such a strong <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>. We human beings, we're very sensitive, very vulnerable, fragile beings, energetically. Someone, "_Bleurgh!_" _-_ it takes a _very_ evolved person, practising _very hard_ ... [laughter] to just hear that and say, you know, no reaction, "I hear," you know, and just to respond, and not react. <a data-href="Anger" class="internal-link">Anger</a> can be blind to its effects on others.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(3) Blind to itself**, as well, the third blindness. <a data-href="Anger" class="internal-link">Anger</a> often - it feels like it's so clear, that we're just striking through things with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> sword of <a data-href="Manjushri" class="internal-link">Manjushri</a>: we're seeing _exactly_ what's happening!

<span class="paragraph">So part of practice is to really be honest about this, and about these blindnesses, and explore them. Oftentimes, when we feel <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>, it feels a lot easier to vent it. And it might feel easier in the moment. But in the long run, it's not. It's really not. ==What am I building when I vent <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>? What am I crystallizing and conditioning in myself, and in the relationship, and in others?== Again, this is one of these quite complex issues, so I just want to, in a way, open it up.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Is it possible to feel <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>, to feel the <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>, and to express it in a way that the person does not feel dumped on, vomited on, flung at? Some of you may be familiar with, just to say, "I feel angry." It's very different from just ranting at someone. One is taking ownership instead of hurling or dumping the <a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a> on another. Big difference in effect. Now, that's not easy. And there's no way that I think anyone realistically would say that's easy. It's very challenging.</span>

<span class="paragraph">This whole area of communication, and particularly communicating what's difficult in our <a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a> - how much of the difficulty we have in <a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a> is around our lack of skill and care and <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> around communication? Such a huge area, and we can easily have a whole <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> talk, a whole day, just on that. And just a little piece - the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> said when there's something difficult to communicate to another, that one speaks what is true, _if it's helpful_.^[MN 58] In other words, if you feel that the person can really hear it, and can learn from it, what's true and helpful, in a helpful way, skilfully - and this is a practice - what's true and helpful, in a helpful way, at the right time. [laughs] So that's _quite_ a ... [laughs] I think it's just a practice. It's really a practice, and of all the <a data-href="precepts" class="internal-link">precepts</a>, all the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Precepts" data-href="Precepts" class="internal-link">five precepts</a>, it's the hardest one.

##### Story: it's a learning process

<span class="paragraph">I think, and I know for myself, and I see it in others, that this is really a learning process. Again, that word 'practice' - it's a practice. It's going to take time. So if I think back, for myself, again, going back twenty years or more, I wasn't even _aware_ of when I felt angry. And then, didn't connect with it. And then, afraid or unable to communicate that to others. And then, learnt, gradually, willing to try and do that, but went way over the other side. So I basically dropped, you know, small thermonuclear devices on people, _really_ going overboard. It was part of the learning process. Luckily I could say sorry in a lot of cases, but it actually fractured a lot of <a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a>. And again, it was coming out of, in a way, wanting to be earnest, and wanting to address what was actually an imbalance in myself, and wanting to be honest, and wanting to stand in the truth. And yet it was so difficult to do that in a way that was balanced. So we're going to make mistakes, and I think that's okay. Or we neglect to say something when we actually should have.</span>

<span class="paragraph">A while ago - can't remember when it was - I had a situation that went on with someone, and I felt quite upset by what was going on. I can't actually remember what it was now! But anyway ... [laughter] And I remember asking to speak with this person, and the first thing I said when I went in to speak with her was, "I really want you to know my intention is not to hurt. I really don't want to hurt in what I'm saying, and I don't want to retaliate. It may be that what I'm saying doesn't come out perfectly. I still feel agitated and upset a little bit, and I don't know if I can say it perfectly, so please just bear that in <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> and excuse that. But please, please know my intention is not to hurt."</span>

<span class="paragraph">And in a way, I felt that was really helpful, just first thing, saying that, setting up, setting up a kind of context of non-harming, setting up the intention - setting up also the humanity of it, so I could be human, I could be less than perfect, which actually also invited her, or allowed her, to be less than perfect, to be human. And that was something, it felt very, very helpful to do that at the time. Now, of course, if one does something like that, you have to make sure that you really don't have an intention to hurt. You can't just go in there saying, "Yeah, I don't intend to hurt," and then, you know, you've got your ... [laughter]</span>

<span class="paragraph">Sometimes it takes time, sitting with it - couple of minutes, couple of hours, couple of days, couple of weeks, or more - sitting with something that really hurts, working with the <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>, being with the <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>, teasing out what's there, the hurt underneath, etc., the sadness, until we feel pretty sure that we can go in there, and there's very, very little intention to hurt or retaliate, or be the one who's right, or whatever it is. And then we're much more ready to have that conversation. All this is very challenging.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Sometimes we find ourselves in relationship on the receiving end of <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>. Someone is angry at us for what we've done or not done, whatever it is. And then it's a whole skill to hear <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>. And this is very interesting too. Again, if I think back, I used to be a person, when people were angry with me - again, and I feel, looking back, and I'm sure many others share this, it was coming out of a kind of earnestness, you know, and really wanting to look at my faults and see where I could grow and open and transform. So someone was angry at me, and would hurl that <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>, or would just go - you know, back in the eighties, when it was really ... you know, that was the way to do it. [laughter] At least in America it was. [laughter] And what I would do, out of earnestness, was completely open up, energetically: "Yeah, give it to me." [laughter] Because I really wanted to be totally honest and totally open and totally take in what was being said. Maybe I could learn something about myself. Maybe there really was something that I needed to be honest about, and get to the bottom of, and transform.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And what I found with that was basically, I was keeled over. I mean, energetically, in some instances, I remember, it would take weeks to recover. I mean, it was so strong, the energetic effect. And then I remember a teacher, Michael, at - I can't remember what it was - a day <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> or an evening class or something, and he said, "You know, we're not obliged to take on or open ourselves to, or even stick around for, someone's <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> of rage, <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> of <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>." And I heard that, and my jaw hung. It seemed completely radical to me. And what he was saying was, you could say to a person, "I really see that you're angry, and I really want to hear what it is that you're upset about, and I really want to hear what's going on. But I'm not prepared to take on that <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to open myself to that. So when you feel able to just tell me that in a way that's more calm, then I'm ready to listen. So maybe, you know, go for a walk or whatever."</span>

<span class="paragraph">Now ... [laughter] Of course, the person is probably going to ... [laughter] go through the roof, so ... [laughter] I think there has to be some skill in saying, but I think the point is quite interesting. And again, I'm sure I'm not alone in that pattern, so I'm voicing it. But I'm sure I'm not alone in that pattern of, out of earnestness, opening oneself up to that. Do we open ourselves up to listening to what the person has to say? Yes. The <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>, the rage, that violence? Why?</span>

But in a situation like that, when one person can say to the other, can look and see the hurt that's underneath the <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>, and then express to the other person _genuine_ feeling: "It really pains me. I feel sad that I hurt you." And there's something going underneath just this clashing at the surface. In a way, when two people are like that, someone has to do that. Someone has to be the one that takes the risk and is vulnerable, and expresses that and softens. Someone has to show their hurt. Not easy, but if that doesn't happen - well, we all know it just keeps battering at that same level. Somehow to say to someone: "I'm really ... It pains me that I hurt you."</span>

##### Encourage gentleness and care that runs through the body

<span class="paragraph">So, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, and all through the categories as it opens up. Talking a lot about - or _I've_ been talking a lot about the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> and the importance of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>.

So you may want to explore this a bit. I feel this is a very important aspect of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_.

<span class="paragraph">Can we begin to explore - this is an option - can we begin to explore a tenderness of touch for ourselves? So this might sound a little, I don't know, hokey for some people, or embarrassing. But what would it be - and we've all got single rooms here, so it's fine to do it. [laughter] What would it be to actually begin to explore - it's just an option - explore touching the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> with tenderness? What is it? One hand touches the other hand, and through the hand, in the touch, through the touch, there is tenderness there. You can actually feel it. And one part of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> is expressing to the other tenderness. Hand on the arm, hand on the chest, hand on the belly - just feel into that, and imagine it, and just feel the tenderness moving through the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>. Play with it as a practice if you want to. I feel it's very important. Or we're standing outside or doing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">walking meditation</a> outside. And again, some of this you may have uncovered anyway. ==Walking, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">walking meditation</a>, and the foot touches the earth, and actually, there can be a kiss there. There can be <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, somehow felt, tenderness, <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a> felt, between foot and earth. This is available to us, something we can explore, something we can play with.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">Way So to experiment with this.

And in a way, <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> and <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> go very closely together. How often is it that someone needing <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, they come to us, and what they really need is our <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> and the fullness of our <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a>, the softness of our <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a>? And through that very <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a>, that's actually all they need. They need to be heard, need to be seen, need to be held in that <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a>. The looking itself expresses the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, carries the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. And can be with each other here, can be with <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a>, trees, to look at a tree with that - what is it? Play with this, possibly, if you want.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And again, here, as I said on the opening night, I think, no hurry. Nothing to hurry for here. To really slow down. In a way, that slowing down can also open up this tenderness that flows through the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>. So stomping down the corridor, slamming doors, and clunking cutlery - you know, of course it's all fine. There's no problem with any of that. But can there actually be, through all these little movements, little interactions, there is actually the tenderness running through? Experiment with it. ==Touch the handle of a door.

<span class="paragraph">Sometimes this 'slow/hurry' thing, and its relationship in the life, is actually easier to see outside, off <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>. So I know if I go to Newton Abbot, and - I'm not saying anything about Newton Abbot. If I go to Newton Abbot and I've got an agenda of things to do, a list, and I've got a limited amount of time, and I'm hurrying through the high street - got to go to the bank, got to go to the chemist, whatever - and somehow, in the very hurrying, the leaning forward, and I'm going through Newton Abbot with my little summary of _what I want_ sort of on the sheet of paper, and that very _what I want_ - basically, <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a> encapsulated on a piece of paper ...

<span class="paragraph">Versus - and you know, this is actually part of life nowadays, to have to be in a hurry. But versus sometimes being there and dropping that, a little bit, and maybe still getting the stuff done. Dropping that _what I want_ - you can play with this. What happens when you're moving in the hustle, the bustle, the busyness of Newton Abbot high street, wherever it is ... and you just drop that? ==Possibility for a wider sense of mystery of being to come in, and in that, a wider sense of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. And one sees: it's life going on. It's life expressing itself. And children moving, and old people, and interactions with shopkeepers, and business transactions, and - it's all just expressing itself. And dogs, and whatever it is - life expressing itself. And there is an opening of the heart to that.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">Can be even - small example, but very pertinent to what we're doing here - come <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a>: "I want to get concentrated." Too tight in the _what I want_, and what's the downside? Irritability. Someone just breathes a little bit too loudly next to you, and there is irritability there. Or the radiator makes a noise, or whatever it is. Heart's closing. So again, _what I want_ and <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a>, and the struggle with all that is related to the opening and the closing of the heart.</span>

<span class="paragraph">On any <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, and on this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, there is a possibility, as we deepen, as time goes on, to begin slowing down, but also to begin relaxing this struggle with <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>: <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a> what we don't like, pulling towards us what we like, and this _what I want_ so much.

<span class="paragraph">As there's more stillness in the being, and more silence, a couple of things, a number of things can happen. One of them is that our sense of priority gets much clearer. So the usual stuff that we're caught up in as feeling very important in our everyday bustle begins to just settle. And what's most important, what's most deeply important to us - which may be the absolute necessity of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, the wish to surrender to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, to open in <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> - what's deeply important to us comes more and more to the fore, becomes prominent in <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>.

[laughter] ==Guilt is making a conclusion about <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>. Remorse, I would say, is making a conclusion about the action.== So guilt has a way of making definitions and binding oneself in a definition of <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>: "I'm bad. I'm useless. I'm a failure. I'm not a good person." Remorse is saying, "In the future, I would rather not act that way. I want to choose something different." It's saying something about the action. It's forward-looking, creative, open, whereas guilt is backward-looking and just stays around <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And in that silence, for some people, sometimes, it's almost as if the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ becomes something that we are held in, that we receive. This silence that seems to permeate the universe has <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> in it. Everything, our being, everything that comes up is held in that, held in that <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. So usually, when we do the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, we have a sense of _me_ doing it. ==There's self, and there's effort involved, and the phrases, and we're creating this _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_.

And there are other ways that it can reveal itself.== And so, for some people, the whole way that we're going about it, with phrases, etc., is not the way that's most helpful. For some people, a much more devotional practice, using Green <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tara" data-href="Tara" class="internal-link">Tārā</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Kuan Yin</a> (the <a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a> of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Avalokiteśvara</a>), <a data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">Jesus</a> - beings, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Archetype" data-href="Archetype" class="internal-link">archetypal</a> beings of great <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> - tuning into them, devoting oneself to them, and receiving, in a way, the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> that way.

<span class="paragraph">When, or if, there's this sense of silence - it's actually not that uncommon. I have a friend who, for years, never did any practice - _very_ sporadic kind of flirting with different practices - and she was working somewhere one day and went to get lunch in a restaurant. And she said, just suddenly, she felt like she was sitting inside God's <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. And the whole restaurant was - her words - "inside God's <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>." And she said, "Why isn't anyone talking about this? Why are they all pretending it's not happening?" [laughter]</span>

Somehow it was clear that this unloving attitude was known to the <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a>, and so it wouldn't pass, but intensify. ==What was needed was very clearly a pure embrace of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, breathing to expand the capacity of accepting the unacceptable and relax.==</span>

There's the warmth or whatever it is there, and we feel that. And sometimes that feeling actually becomes relatively steady.

And let the phrases go.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Sometimes that can deepen. And we may be directing the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> towards the friend or whoever it is, the neutral, the benefactor. ==And it seems at first that there was a person _here_ and a person _there_, and the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> is moving towards them. It can deepen. And it's almost like the sense of the person begins to _blur_ a bit. And there is just the sense of two hearts, and a flow, a radiation, between the two hearts. And even that can deepen. And can become, at times, a sense of a kind of communion of hearts. There's just really one heart, one <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>, imbued with love.== Beautiful possibility - not forever, but for a moment, for a stretch of time. Again, not to snatch at any of this. I'm just saying what can come sometimes from the practice.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And in that communion of hearts, a sense of <a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a>. Is it really separate?

But it's still very important. It's extremely important. Our usual sense of things is separateness, is _not_ <a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a>: "I'm here, you're there - separate things, separate beings, separate selves." And to begin, in a way, opening ourselves, getting a taste of some other sense, a sense of <a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a>.
