##### This talk is an orientation for the whole retreat
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^1-1" data-href="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#^1-1" class="internal-link">1-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (2) · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11955/20080129-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_place_of_samadhi_in_metta_practice-11955.mp3#t=00:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So what I would like to talk about today is _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_. This is a word some of you will be familiar with and some less so. It's a Pali word, _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_. I particularly want to talk about it, in a way, and set up, hopefully, a little bit of an orientation or of an intention for the whole three weeks here, for the whole <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, a little bit.</span>

##### What is our relationship with samadhi ("concentration")?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^1-2" data-href="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (5) · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> (2) · <a data-href="Anxiety" class="internal-link">Anxiety</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> (2) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11955/20080129-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_place_of_samadhi_in_metta_practice-11955.mp3#t=00:35" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So this word _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ is usually translated as '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a>,' and that will do as a sort of first translation. It's usually translated as '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a>.' And it's interesting - as one of the factors of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a> that we're interested in developing in, what is our relationship with the development of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a>, of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_? And often it's an area where we just kind of assume, "Oh, I'm rubbish at that," and we kind of think, "Well, all right, there's other stuff in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>, too, so all right." Or we have a relationship with it where it's a bit fraught, or even a lot fraught; it's an area where we tend to judge ourselves and judge, "Well ..." Or there's a lot of <a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a> around whether we're developing it or how well we're developing it. So I want to really explore this whole area, particularly its relevance in terms of this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice, and as I say, set up an orientation for the whole <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>.</span>

##### Three major fruits from this retreat
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^1-3" data-href="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> (3) · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">Personhood</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (2) · <a data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Awakening</a> (4) · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11955/20080129-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_place_of_samadhi_in_metta_practice-11955.mp3#t=01:38" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">When a few years ago we were kind of conceiving of this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, one of the factors that really convinced me that it was a good idea to do it was that there are basically three major fruits to get out of a <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> like this. **(1)** And the first is **the development of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, developing those qualities in the heart**. And that's a beautiful thing; it's an indispensable and lovely thing for a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a> to develop that. **(2)** The second was this piece about **<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> how that leads to <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a>, actually using <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> to move towards <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a>**, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> and that kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">liberation</a> of the heart, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Awakening" data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">liberation</a> of the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>. **(3)** And the third one is **the development of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_**, the development of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a>. And when I was sort of thinking about it, I realized, well, basically, at least some of that is going to happen for everyone, and you can't lose on this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>. [laughs] It's a win-win-win situation, because all of that's there, and it's available.</span>

---
##### It's good to develop loving-kindness and compassion, and that practice leads to concentration
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^1-4" data-href="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Commentaries" class="internal-link">Commentaries</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (2) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Awakening" class="internal-link">Awakening</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11955/20080129-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_place_of_samadhi_in_metta_practice-11955.mp3#t=03:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Traditionally, in the tradition - actually in the <a data-href="commentaries" class="internal-link">commentaries</a> from the tradition - these practices of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> are just regarded as: first of all, it's a good idea to develop <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, so something lovely to develop; but secondly, as something that leads to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a>. And this whole factor of <a data-href="awakening" class="internal-link">awakening</a> was kind of, was reckoned that that wasn't part of what was going on. The thrust of this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> is actually finding a way back in, of that.</span>

---
##### "Concentration" doesn't give enough breadth to the meaning
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^1-5" data-href="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#^1-5" class="internal-link">1-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (5) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Breath" class="internal-link">Breath</a> · <a data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">Beauty</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11955/20080129-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_place_of_samadhi_in_metta_practice-11955.mp3#t=03:31" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, this word - in other traditions it has different meanings, but usually in this tradition it's translated as '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a>,' as I said. And that's a fine translation. It doesn't give enough of a breadth of what it really means, enough either breadth or depth, this word '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a>.' When we hear the word '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a>,' either we tend to think kind of making the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> small and cramming it into a small place and sort of shoving it there and keeping it there, or you tend to think concentrated laundry detergent, so a lot of stuff in a very small space. Or this sense of _keeping_ something _with_ something, so I'm concentrating _on_ the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, or I'm concentrating on that, just 'keeping it with.' And certainly that 'keeping with' is very much a part of what _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ means, staying steady with something. But it's not all of it, and in a way, it might be better to keep the word in its original language to get more of a sense of the breadth of what it means, and actually the <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a> of what it means. Something very, very beautiful in it.</span>

---
##### "Steadiness", "collectedness", "unification" of the body and the mind
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^2-1" data-href="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">Steadiness</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (5) · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (5) · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> (3) · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11955/20080129-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_place_of_samadhi_in_metta_practice-11955.mp3#t=04:54" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So we could throw some more words out: certainly '<a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a>' of the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> with something. '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Collectedness</a>' - there's a real <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness</a>. The <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, feels collected, not scattered, collected. '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Unification</a>' is a really good word, so particularly <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a> of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> and the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> - and in this case, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, the heart. There's a real kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">sense of the body</a> and the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> unifying, coming together, being _one_ as the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ develops. 'Depth' of <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> is a word one of my teachers used to use a lot, and I actually quite like that. There's a real sense of deepening into something as we develop this.</span>

---
##### The conciousness is becoming more and more refined
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^2-2" data-href="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (3) · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> (3) · <a data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">Letting go</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11955/20080129-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_place_of_samadhi_in_metta_practice-11955.mp3#t=05:41" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">One of the other factors with _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ is refinement, so the <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> actually being refined, and this is kind of an interesting one. If we take the other extreme, what's on the other extreme of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_? Well, something like a tantrum. Put it that way - it's about as far on the other extreme as you could get, a tantrum. It's not a very refined state of <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>. Things are pretty gross, usually pretty black and white. It's not very refined. <a data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">Letting go</a> of that, the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> can move into more and more refinement. And one discovers, as one deepens in _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, more and more refinement to the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, the <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>.</span>

---
##### A continuum of deepening, unifying, refining
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^2-3" data-href="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">Jhanas</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11955/20080129-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_place_of_samadhi_in_metta_practice-11955.mp3#t=06:23" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So we certainly can talk about discrete states of depth of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ and this _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_ and that _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jhanas" data-href="Jhanas" class="internal-link">jhāna</a>_, and I'm actually not going to go into that today. Rather to regard it as a kind of continuum, that the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> can move in this continuum of deepening, of unifying, of refining.</span>

##### This is a lifelong exploration
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^2-4" data-href="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#^2-4" class="internal-link">2-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> (2) · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11955/20080129-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_place_of_samadhi_in_metta_practice-11955.mp3#t=06:44" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And this is a lifelong exploration. It's something that there is actually no bottom to it, I don't think. We can just keep deepening and refining this. And to me, to be alive on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a> and have that aliveness on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>, it's actually lifelong. We keep exploring this. Something very lovely there. Keep exploring the potential depths of <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>. This is available to us as human beings, as meditators, to just go on this journey into the depths of <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a>_ also brings with it, as it deepens - and I'm talking really about a very big picture now - but it brings an expansion of <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a>. So the typical, everyday <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a> that we go about our lives governed by - "I'm here, you're there, sitting in a room together, _da-da-da_," - that begins to be expanded. The usual sense of things begins to be expanded. And through that expansion comes a kind of <a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a>, very slowly, very gradually - and sometimes suddenly. A <a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a>, meaning the beginnings of an opening to another sense of things. Comes a deep sense of rest as the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ deepens. The whole being - the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, the <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a> - the whole being finds a really deep rest. We find that as the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ develops - over our _life_, really - that we're actually more available to life and to others and to ourselves. There's more capacity in the being to be available. And there's a real freshness of discovery that comes with it, freshness of <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a>, that we we're able to look at life in very, actually _radically_, different ways, new ways, uncover different <a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a>.</span>

There's an almost infinite range of skills that a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a> can develop, and some of them are just breathtaking. You know, you think about what it takes to play a piano concerto really well, or to write a piano concerto. Or <a data-href="David Beckham" class="internal-link">David Beckham</a>, when he curls the ball like that. [laughter] Amazing! Amazing. And the range is extraordinary. I don't know if you did this when you were a kid - you can pile coins on your elbow. Did you ever do this? And then do _that_. [swiping his arm down] And you catch them - or you hope. You _try_ and catch them. The world record, I think, is like 104 10p pieces. So it's quite amazing. The person probably really put a lot of time and effort developing that skill. [laughter] Amazing! [laughter] Dharmically speaking ... [laughter] Question is, which skills are _worth_ developing? [laughter] What's really _worth_ developing? So I actually very much appreciate <a data-href="David Beckham" class="internal-link">David Beckham</a>. [laughter] But really, for ourselves, in our lifetime, we have limited time in this life, limited time. Our time _will_ run out. We have limited <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>. What's worth developing as a skill? What's worth developing?</span>

It tends to get viewed in the way of having a very microscopic <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a> on something, so really being able to look at the fine detail. That's not what _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ means, and the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> never meant it that way.

And it's a bit unrealistic to sort of just be in these nice states and expect the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ to apply." And so, actually there was a lot of integrity in what he was saying, but there's something about _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ that allows things to take root at a cellular level, as the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> collects.

It's the beginnings of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_. Just show up - _however one feels_.</span>

##### So strength is also an aspect of samadhi

<span class="paragraph">So this goes for outside practice. You get up one day, and - you know, not <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a>, or here <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a> - and you don't feel so good: "Oh, I'll skip my sitting this morning. I'm a bit tired," or "I'm not feeling well." Understandable. There's something about the <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> - no matter how one feels - that gives this <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a>, gives a strength as well. So strength is also an aspect of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ - strength of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, a strength that's pliable. ==I'm not talking about something rigid or brittle, but a deep strength, a soft strength, in a way.== And again, that comes into the being, begins to come into the being, just by virtue of showing up, practising, whatever we feel like. And in the practice, sitting or walking, returning: just returning to the phrases, returning to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, returning to the object over and over and over. Again, it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">embodying</a> that <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a>. ==It's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">embodying</a> that strength of commitment. That will find its way into the being. And in time, staying more with the phrases, staying more with the object.==</span>

##### One of the fruits of samadhi is steadiness (study results)

<span class="paragraph">So one of the fruits of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ - and I'm talking about long-term and in a lifetime. You will probably notice on this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, definitely. Again, please remember, what I'm talking about today might feel like, "Well, I'm nowhere near that." It's the beginning of the <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>. I'm talking hopefully something you can keep in the back of your <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, at least in the back, for the whole <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>. One of the fruits of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ is <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> - <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>. And the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> talked over and over about this and the importance of it. Recently, in the last couple of years, there was a study done of meditators and found that meditators were actually happier than non-meditators. And there was something - if I get this right - the right prefrontal cortex was more active, which is your positive <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a>. And the left was less active, which is your negative. I'm not sure if that's the right way round, but something like that. And interestingly, what they found was, generally, meditators were happier. But meditators who'd done at least 10,000 hours ... [laughs] There's some kind of significant _jump_ in the graph there. [laughter] 10,000 hours and the whole thing leaps. So I don't know how quick you are at arithmetic, but 10,000 hours is quite a lot! [laughs] It's a lot more than you even do on this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>. But just to say, hang in there! [laughs] But definitely, definitely, and the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>, you know, millennia ago, was very clear: _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ in the long term leads to <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>, no question about it.</span>

##### It works also in the reverse: the most important contributor to samadhi is happiness
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^5-2" data-href="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#^5-2" class="internal-link">5-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (5) · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (4) · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">Pleasantness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">But he said something very interesting as well, and it's kind of the reverse. And someone asked him, "Okay, so _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ is a good idea. What's the thing that most feeds _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, that's the most important contributor to _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_?" Without blinking, he said, "<a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a>."^[SN 12:23] So that's interesting - <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> _comes_ from _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, but <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> _feeds_ _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_. And this is very, very significant for us as meditators. ==We need, and particularly on a <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> like this, we need to take care, as much as possible, of a kind of baseline foundation of our sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourish</a> our sense of happiness.== So I'm not talking about any fireworks. I'm just talking about inclining the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> to a sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a>, of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a>.</span>

##### There are many things to appreciate

<span class="paragraph">So how do we go about that? Can we be on the <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> in a way that's open? Sometimes, very understandably, we come <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a>, and because of what we've heard or seen or just get into a groove, we do _this_, and we kind of shrink down the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>. And we say, "Right, I'm really going to apply myself," and it shrinks down. Can there be - and please experiment with this - a kind of opening, <a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a>, and an inclining the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> towards <a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a>? So there are all kinds of things right here, right now, today, in this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, to appreciate. Many, many things - we have eight wonderful managers looking after us, cooking for us, taking care of us; we have the <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a> of the grounds, the building, the <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a>; we have the teachings; we have each other. And again, I think <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Catherine McGee" data-href="Catherine McGee" class="internal-link">Catherine</a> said on the opening talk, you know, we can get very much into this 'eyes down' kind of thing. What would it be - please experiment - to look around? "Who's here? Who am I practising with? Who are these lovely people dedicating themselves, supporting me in my practice? How wonderful!" Because how much more difficult it would be if we were here alone, one was here alone. Have a look around at lunchtime. ==You know, sometimes you want to be a bit more inner, and it's appropriate to be with one's own <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>. But other times, open up. Can there be an <a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a> of the <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a> of what's going on here and the loveliness of everyone practising together, trying together, supporting each other, in the silence, in the schedule, and all that?==</span>

##### It's going to happen in a very non-linear way
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice > ^6-1" data-href="0129 The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#^6-1" class="internal-link">6-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> (4) · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So over time, gradually, the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unification</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a> begins to deepen, begins to deepen. This does not happen - ever - in a linear way. In other words, if someone comes into an interview and they just report this steady, smooth assent into the ethereal realms of bliss, without any ups and downs, it's not realistic. It doesn't happen. It's going to happen in a very non-linear way, very up and down, and that's just how human <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> works.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So I was talking this morning about the <a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a> and the sort of very typical challenges we face. Learn to expect the waves, okay? Just, they're a given. Learn to expect them. Learn to accept them, meaning accept that they're there. To accept them doesn't mean to kind of lie down and let them steamroll over you and dictate the whole course of your <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> for two or three days. But to accept that they're there. They're a feature of <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>. Sometimes it's a matter of just seeing them out - just be patient, just keep plugging away, and one sees them out. Other times, we gave a lot of possibilities this morning of ways of working with them, and really being quite active. So sometimes it's just seeing them out, and sometimes really working quite actively - very important though - in the context of accepting them. So learning to work with.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And the two things, the two general points that I mentioned this morning: **(1)** if possible, **not being taken for a ride, recognizing, "This is what's going on. Ah, it's such-and-such a hindrance. Aha! Okay," and not getting so, in a way, seduced or infatuated by the story** and the content of what it seems that's going on - this <a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a> or <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> or whatever it is, or the doubt. Seeing it for what it is, recognizing it - huge. Half the battle is right there. **(2)** And **not taking them personally**, so not judging oneself because of the presence of a hindrance. This is huge. ==Once we judge ourselves because a hindrance is there, we're adding fuel to the fire with the hindrance. Not to take them personally.== Can we have an attitude of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>, so that this whole <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> is kind of imbued as much as possible with an attitude of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>? You know, the <a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a> come up, it's difficult, you're in a difficult stretch, a couple of hours that are difficult, half a day that's difficult - how much <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a> can we meet that with? Not <a data-href="reactivity" class="internal-link">reactivity</a>, but <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Anyone who's doing a practice like this, like a _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice, or working with the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>, or <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, or some kind of <a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a> practice, or anyone who _hears_ about a practice like this - maybe not anyone, but 99 per cent of people - will often have at least one of four objections, if not all four. And it can seem like one begins to do a practice like this, and the whole idea of staying with something, and the whole idea of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, seems like, "Hmm, maybe it's not such a good idea after all." And it can feel very difficult. So I want to go into this and explore it, and hopefully just look at these with a bit of intelligence and reconsider them.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So, they are:</span>

##### 1. Tightness

<span class="paragraph">**(1)** When we give ourselves to cultivating _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, oftentimes what comes up is a sense of **<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a>**. In the process, we actually feel quite tight - and you may have, probably, discovered that already. Trying to stay with something, you're trying, and it can feel really tight. The very effort to stay with something can feel tight. Tightening.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(2)** The whole notion of **working towards a goal**, a goal of deepening my <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a> or developing _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ or developing _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, and "Won't I get into some striving around that?" So these are very legitimate concerns, and I just want to explore them a little bit: <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a>, relationship with goals and striving for goals.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(4)** And the last one, **suppression**. Is it possible that through this just, you know, repeating phrases to myself, or just staying with one thing and maybe even feeling good in doing that, that I'm actually suppressing some emotion or some issue in the being, in the <a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a>, that needs to come up?

<span class="paragraph">These four: **(1) <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a>**, **(2) relationship to goals and striving**, **(3) attachment, the possibility of attachment**, and **(4) the question of suppression - are we suppressing?** So I want to go into this a little bit. These come up. They _will_ come up. They're going to come up, these questions and these doubts. And a lot of people are going to feel put off as that comes up. So we're practising _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, and something comes up like this, and we think, "Oh I should leave all that. I should leave this _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>._ I should leave the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_. And I'll just go to an open practice of 'being with what is' - not trying to do anything, just 'being with what is' or 'just being' or whatever." And this is unbelievably common. I mean, almost everyone who goes about doing a practice like this will have that quite strong inclination at one point: "Too much work," or "I don't really think this is right, let me just - ahh! - just _be_; go to an open _vipassanā_ practice." So I want to go into this.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(1)** First one: **<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a>**. How can we do this practice and not get so tight? ==So softness - in a way the opposite of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a> - softness is actually a factor of _samādhi_.== So when we talk about what does _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ mean, it actually has softness in it; it has a kind of non-rigidity, non-<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a> in it; it's part of the quality of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_. One of the ways that's very important to prevent <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a> taking too much hold - and it _will_ come up. You _will_ be dealing at times with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a>. There's no question about it, as you try this practice, no question. One of them is to ==make the <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> a bit bigger, meaning make the range of the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> a bit bigger. As I said at least once in the instructions, the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> says "sensitive to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a>."==^[DN 22, MN 110] Can we have, as very much a part of our practice, an <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> that includes the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a>? And kind of to be anchored in that. And as well, in this breadth of <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a>, an <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> of, "How am I feeling about the practice right now? What's my emotional relationship with the practice right now? Am I bored? Am I trying too hard? Am I disinterested? Am I striving?" The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> sense can reflect this relationship that we have with the practice in the moment. ==When we get too tight, what happens? We actually feel it in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>. So part of the art of <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>, part of the art of deepening _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, is to have this kind of background <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> of breadth of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, and be sensitive to it.== It will reflect what's going on in terms of the relationship.</span>

<span class="paragraph">As the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ deepens, it's actually, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> becomes really, really central. It's very important. The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> sense is actually crucial, and that's why I keep saying the "sensitive to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">whole body</a>." The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> is really at the anchor of what we're doing.

So it gets a little bit more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a> or more refined or more open or less defined. And that's all part of - over time, over time - of the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ deepening. But we can work with this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a>, and in the sensitivity to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, be aware of when it's there, and then just relax the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>. Just relax the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>.

<span class="paragraph">Sometimes we go about this practice, and it's very much like rolling up the sleeves, and "_May. I. Be. At. Ease._" [laughter] It's not going to happen that way.

<span class="paragraph">So again, can there be <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a> to oneself in this?

There's just going to be <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a>, and you _will_ feel, "Ah, I should go to _vipassanā_ practice.

It's just, "Okay, just accept the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a>."

<span class="paragraph">But we can be sensitive to the effort that we put in. In this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> sensitivity, you can feel when there's too much effort because the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> reflects it - <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a> in the shoulders, or the belly gets tight, or something just cramps up a little bit. And be sensitive to that, as part of the practice, and relax it. ==So part of the developing the art is deepening this sensitivity and subtlety of <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to effort levels. And we learn: "Oh, a bit more, you know, a bit more foot on the gas; a bit off, a bit more off." Part of the art - play with it. Experiment.== Bring it in rather than leaving it out.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So in a way, and particularly in the context of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Catherine McGee" data-href="Catherine McGee" class="internal-link">Catherine</a> - I spoke to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Catherine McGee" data-href="Catherine McGee" class="internal-link">Catherine</a> last night a couple of times. And she told me she spoke a bit about - to oneself, the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ to oneself - giving and receiving <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. So this is also connected with the effort. Sometimes we might need to move more into a receptive mode, receiving. And that can very much help with the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a> as well, and generally with the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_. If we're too tight, too tight with the effort, too efforting, it can have the opposite effect of what we intend. And the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is actually squeezed, and - not a particularly great <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, but it's a bit like a half-peeled banana, and you're squeezing the bottom end, and the banana ... Well, either it crushes it ... [laughs] Or it flies off. With the best intentions, you're trying to be too tight. You're actually ending up being too tight with the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, and it has the opposite effect: the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> drifts off more. More thoughts and more following thoughts. Or sometimes we're too loose, and there's just a dullness that comes in, a kind of sinking of the <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> that comes in. To be aware of this: it's all part of the subtlety, and you can be aware of it, and you can play with it. It's a very delicate process. Okay, so that first objection, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">tightness</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(2)** Second possible one is this, around **goals**. And we could really, gosh, talk all day about this.

And yes, there's definitely something to that, there's definitely a depth that needs to be explored there. But don't be too quick with it. Don't be too quick. And to bring one's whole integrity and intelligence to this question, and honesty. Our life is _full_ of goals. _Full_ of goals our life is!

<span class="paragraph">I think in the opening talk John mentioned this word _brahmavihāra_. So _brahma_ means 'divine' or 'sublime,' and _vihāra_ means 'dwelling.' ==So these practices, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, are really dwellings for the heart: the heart, the being, the <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> dwells in a space, in an inner space, of <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a>, of sublimity, of something that feels divine.== And more and more, as the <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> goes by, you will get a sense of that, of a real dwelling place for the <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>, for the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, for the heart. So _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a>_ - _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, and <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> - they are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">divine abidings</a>, divine dwellings, _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a>_. _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samādhi</a>_, too - as the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ deepens, it becomes a dwelling for the <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>. When we think about "Where does my <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>, my <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, usually dwell?", and we actually look at that, it's often not in the greatest of places. [laughter] Oftentimes it's not really actually dwelling anywhere at all. It's all over the place. It's not dwelling. It's not abiding anywhere. It's literally just pulled here and then pulled there, and whatever it is that's sort of making the biggest impression is where it's 'dwelling.' Very _un_settled, _not_ dwelling. Or, and maybe even worse, is we're actually dwelling in something that's really not very helpful for us - self-criticism, self-judgment, irritability at others, a whole range of difficult states that sadly, but realistically, human beings can kind of make a home out of. We can get so used to this over our life and over the decades, so used to, as I was saying this morning, the groove kind of being one of unhelpfulness and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a>. Something not so helpful becomes our dwelling, and it's almost second <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a> to us.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So part of the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice, as I was touching on this morning, is actually replacing that negative dwelling with a bit more positive one - or a lot more positive dwelling. Oftentimes we find ourselves with a lot of thought, and it's oftentimes a lot of self-critical thought, self-judgmental thought, or judging others, or a situation. What if we use that <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> of thought (which is already zipping around), and we use the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ (which is thought; it's thought-<a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>)?

<span class="paragraph">I remember a period - I can't remember how long it was, maybe a year, or two years or something - when I just gave myself just to _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice for that time. So all my formal practice, and as much as possible throughout the day - you know, in the shower, walking down the street, whatever it was, just _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_. An absolutely wonderful thing to do. At the beginning of that period, what was quite interesting was I would be walking on the way to work, down the street, and would be trying to do the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, and the inclination that would be there was, "Well, I don't want to kind of fill my <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> with that. I want to let my <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> be creative and let things come to me spontaneously." And then I had a kind of closer second look at kind of, well, what was coming up in my <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> if I just let it be? And it wasn't really that creative. [laughter] You know, most thoughts, you've thought them at least a thousand times before. How many thoughts do you actually have that you've never thought before? How many thoughts do you actually have that are truly helpful? I mean, when you really look at it, it's not that many. And so, once I began to see that, it's like, "I'm fine replacing all that junk with the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_." And the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> actually, slowly, it becomes less enticed by all this other stuff that can feel - we can feel so, "Well, I _need_ to think that, I just _need_ to think that," or "I need to let my <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> go in some way." It becomes less enticing. The <a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a>, and the seduction of the <a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a>, and their story - like I said this morning, what they build up - becomes gradually less enticing as the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ develops, very gradually.</span>

So that's why I'm mentioning this. But again, saying some things today that will apply for the whole <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>. For some people, the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ develops, and something begins to (how to put it?) _arise_ in the <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, and it's called _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>_. So some of you may have heard this word; it's another Pali word, _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>_. And it really means any pleasant physical sensation that arises, you could say, from <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>. So anything at all - could be just a feeling of warmth or comfort, or sometimes tingling, or lightness, or pleasure, or heart-opening, or sort of a rising feeling, opening, expanding. It can be all - a whole range of what it actually is in terms of <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, but also a range of how strong it is. So sometimes, for some people, its _unbearably_ strong; it's really like a lightning bolt of ecstasy, just "_Pleugh_, it's _too_ much!" I don't know how common that is, you know, statistically. I don't know, but it can happen. And the other extreme is something really not that remarkable, that you're not going to be rushing to write a postcard to your friend saying, "Guess what happened to me today?" It's just some nice feeling of comfort and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a> and pleasure in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>.

<span class="paragraph">I remember one of my teachers, Ajaan Geoff, saying, actually, "You know what? Go ahead and _get_ attached to it. _Get_ attached." And I'd never heard anything like this before, so I was like, "_Really_?" [laughter] And of course he proved totally right. It's actually fine to get attached to this. The being matures, the <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> matures, and it lets go of that attachment. Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Enjoy it if there's something to enjoy. Oftentimes the people that make a big fuss about getting attached to pleasure in <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> don't seem to make too much fuss about all kinds of _other_ attachments that are in their life - you know, great food, a nice house to live in, you know, whatever else it is. And that goes unchallenged, and yet the attachment in <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> gets challenged a lot. I think that's a little backwards. Not to mention all the unhealthy stuff inwardly, <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>-criticism, etc., that we can get attached to.</span>

And it's unfamiliar, and <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> comes up. And this is very, very common. Sometimes we're meditating, and the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> is really strong. We're in very unfamiliar territory, and it's like, "_What_ is going on? Bring back normality, please." That's okay. When that happens, just go to the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> and work with the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> in terms of being with the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> as you probably all know how to do in terms of _vipassanā_. But sometimes, what happens is a kind of interesting in-between state: there's some degree of opening and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">enjoyment</a>, and we feel like, "Oh, I'm opening into something new here," and there's pleasure, and the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> as well. And we're sort of - got both things going on. Unfortunately, how often the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> gets pulled like a magnet into the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>. And does it have to? ==If the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>'s not that strong, it's possible - just take a step back, say, "I've got two things going on," not push away the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, but just incline towards what's pleasurable, what's enjoyable in the <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, and just lean that way. And the very enjoying of it will help the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> to just subside.== It's a matter, again, of an acquired taste, of getting used to it. So, slowly, slowly it's like just learning that we can trust that in <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Okay, I'm just ... almost finished. As this happens, the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ deepens, and there's less of a fixed, less of a sort of defined <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a> - there's actually more <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> that's coming out of the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_. So _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a> -_ you know, <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> comes from doing _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice. <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> _also_ comes from doing <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> practice, if you're doing it well, and right. <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> also comes from doing _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ practice.

That's a kind of mark of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ as it deepens.== And I _have_ known, occasionally, people to be able to go into deep states of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ and actually do it without this sense of openness and <a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a> and <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, and what they end up with is something that's very fragile. So in one case I'm remembering, a person that was <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a> long-term - I wasn't working with them - and they were here long-term, doing this kind of practice, but in a way that wasn't really receptive and open, didn't really have a lot of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> in it. And then they hit a quite ... definitely a very challenging health crisis, and it all, the whole practice just went out the window, just completely crumbled. And partly, the reason was it didn't have this softness in it, didn't have that <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and that <a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a> in it. They were actually going about it in the wrong way. But generally, the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ naturally has the <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> in it.</span>

<span class="paragraph">This is a very interesting question. It's a very delicate question. And I think mostly what I want to say is, don't rush into an answer here. It's very interesting what's going on. So just, can we really bring an investigation to this? I remember at least ten years ago - more. Twelve? I can't remember. I was at an evening class of <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> in the States. And there had been a situation of a person that I knew who had been (what to say?) very criminal, was doing some criminal stuff, and it involved me and some other people. And I was feeling really angry about this, and I had uncovered this over time. There was a lot of <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> around, over a period of time, and really trying to be with this <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> and work with it. And one evening at this <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> class, I was just meditating, and there was some degree of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ - nothing particularly deep or _jhānic_ or extraordinary, but just some degree of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">collectedness</a>. And into that, the memory of this person, the <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a> of this person came up. And it was very clear. There was a lot of clarity there. I could see: the <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a> came up, and a _moment_ of the <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>, a _moment_ of it. But what wasn't there was - it didn't spark into anything bigger. Like usually, [it would be] quite a big <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> and a big whole feeling of that. And it just came up, and it was <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>, and it just ... nothing came of it. It's like nothing - it was a spark that didn't ignite a fire.</span>

<span class="paragraph">This made a huge impression on me. It's sort of a story of a non-event, but it's actually a huge impression it made on me.

What I realized, and what she realized from that - something that we take as a given, as something that needs to come up, in this case the <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> (I can't actually remember what her emotion was), it needs us to build it up. It needs conditions to be there. And in that moment, when I was in the <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>, it didn't have the conditions to create it. So we _can_ tend to think, "Here is a storehouse of old <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a>" - I'm treading very delicately here. I don't want to come down on one side or the other. I just want to expose this area. I'm not saying one of them. I'm just saying, "Have a look at it a bit more clearly." ==We tend to think of a storehouse of old <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a>: "Here's <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>. I need to release it. I need it to come up." But it cannot come up unless the conditions in the <a data-href="present moment" class="internal-link">present moment</a> are there for it to come up. And sometimes when we're really clear, we can actually see this process, that if we don't feed it in the present, it doesn't come up. It _cannot_ come up.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">So usually we tend to think of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ as, I'm kind of - "Here I am, trying to keep my _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ together. I'm trying to keep the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice. I'm _doing_ something. I'm _making_ something there." As we go into it, we see that _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ is actually making less and less. We're doing less and less. It's very, very interesting - it's not obvious at all. As we make less and less, we make less and less self, and there's more and more <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> coming out of that. We begin to see this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of things</a>. It comes out of the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice and out of the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ practice. ==Begin to see that things cannot be 'things' without me _doing_ something, without me actually faffing around a lot, and putting a lot, and building them up in there.== And it's this seeing of <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> - and you see it in a very gradual way. It's not really a sudden thing. It's a very gradual, over and over - it's this seeing and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> of <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> that brings the deepest <a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a> in life and in our practice.

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Yes, good, good. Yeah. So I'll repeat this anyway at some point, but the phrases are really a crutch. Sometimes you're going to really need the phrases and the fullness of the phrases, and this kind of <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> of the phrases, and the concreteness of the phrases. And as I've said, at some point yesterday or today, if the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> feels quite scattered, even good to say each phrase twice. You're sort of there for the first one, and then the second one, you're really there.</span>

<span class="paragraph">As the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ deepens or the feeling of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ deepens, you will find that your need for the phrases changes. So sometimes you don't need any phrase at all, and there's a feeling there, and you feel warm, and there's <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>. Just be with that. Just be with that in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, and just let the phrases go. But it's a continuum. You can be in this not saying any phrases as long as it lasts like that, as long as you can stay connected. When it fades, come back to the phrases. There's a sort of in-between, when you might find the phrases can be a lot more light and a lot more sparse. In other words, you can - what are the phrases again? "May I be safe." [laughter] "Safe and protected," sorry. Or "May I live with ease." That's one. [laughter] That might become just one word, so instead of "May I live with" or "May I _da-da-da_" or "May you _da-da-da,_" it just becomes "ease ... ease ... ease." And it can become _very_ sparse, even less regular than that. You can be very fluid. ==This is a very fluid, very responsive practice. One of the skills in _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ practice, one of the skills in _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ practice, is responsiveness. So what is the way of using the phrases or leaving the phrases that's most helpful right now for you? That's it.== In the art of what's going on is this responsiveness to more, less, tighter, looser. Does that answer? Yeah? Good, good. So very important, really important.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**Q2: investigating assumptions about suppression, the storehouse,** **and <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>**</span>

<span class="paragraph">Yogi: I asked a question in the morning, and I understood what you said - but maybe I didn't. When you said whatever it is that you don't know if you're suppressing or not, you might just <a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a> if there is something, or maybe it's a behaviour, let's say, that only shows itself in a certain situation. So how do you know if you've dealt with it or not? Do you see what I mean? I know you said there has to be certain conditions for it to arise. In other words, it doesn't show itself. And this is how I suspect that my <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> works. I don't know. I can sit <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a>, and then I come out, and the conditions arise. They have to be like in a certain, specific manner. And unexpectedly, and there it is!</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Okay, so a couple of things here. One is just take a step back. So this is a really delicate - and for a lot of people, it's a very sensitive question. It's really quite a charged question.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Rather than saying, "It's like this," or "It's like _this_," assuming either that things pre-exist as a storehouse, and they're waiting to come up, or assuming that, "Hey, none of that's true, and they don't exist, and it's all empty," which would be two extremes, I just wanted to draw <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to something, that there may be much more to [it] than [it] first seems. So not to kind of rush to a conclusion either way. In what you just said, it was interesting the language that you used. So when there are certain conditions, up it comes.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Is there an assumption in there that here's this thing, kind of pre-packaged, waiting to coming up? So in other words, what I'm saying is, <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> can't be <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a>, a behaviour can't be a behaviour, without us building it in the <a data-href="present moment" class="internal-link">present moment</a>.</span>

---
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: It was there, and then it was gone. This is what happens. It's like there is nothing, right? And it's almost like one can't see in a certain situation. And then when that situation isn't there, there's nothing. But it's not a storehouse, exactly, either, or pre-packaged. Maybe it is. Maybe it is that view or that idea.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: I think it's just an interesting thing to look at. I mean, so rather than trying to come to a conclusion now, maybe you could just investigate that. I think it's an ongoing question, because sometimes the model of a storehouse and things needing to come up is really appropriate and really important, and very much a skilful way of working. But to deepen in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> in the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, one of the most central things is actually deepening in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> what are the conditions that build things in the <a data-href="present moment" class="internal-link">present moment</a>. And we begin to uncover that more and more as the practice deepens. Usually, it's not a way we're used to looking, so we don't usually look that way. But to begin to actually tease them out and see, "Okay, so what was actually contributing to that?" It's something that takes time, but you may just want to keep it open right now and just explore. See what you see about it.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Yogi: It's okay. It just seems to go into hiding. And then, how do you make the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> more transparent? Maybe. I don't know.</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Well, that's the assumption. Is it going into hiding? Now, sometimes, maybe something _is_ going into hiding. We are actually ...</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: Or is it just not there?</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: Well, that's the question - is it really not there?</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Is it not there? And if we can just approach this with a very open, fresh <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, no preconceptions, and just see: "Am I assuming that it's gone into hiding - it's actually there, but I just can't see it? Or is it really not there? Is it really not there? There are times in our life when we are actually repressing things and suppressing things. There's something around that we don't want to deal with, we don't want to feel, and it's pushing it down. But a lot of the times, when things are not there, there's the assumption that they're in hiding or repressed or just out of the range of <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>. And that's what I'm saying. Can we just approach that differently?</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Thank you. Yeah, and that's, I think, really, really skilful, and a beautiful thing to do. Someone was saying this to me in another <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> the other day, "I just want to put all that self-definition aside and just see what's what," and put it away for a while. Maybe put it away for longer. Maybe you put it away, and it comes back. But if you keep putting it away over and over, maybe when it comes back it doesn't have the kind of total convincingness that it seems to most of the time. In other words, sure it comes back, but we don't automatically just totally believe that about ourselves, that we're like this - either how we're telling ourselves how we are, or how other people are telling us. There's a sense of moving in and out of defining <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>, as practice deepens. So of course we live our life defining <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> to our self and to others, but we have times when we don't, and those are beautiful times, precious times. ==You can't stay forever in a state of not defining <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>, but if you do it enough and repeatedly enough, when you go back to defining <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>, you just know, "Well, this is just a conventional definition," and you're not bound by it.== You don't feel wedded to it. Does that make sense? Its believability is that much less. It's just, "Yeah, sure, I'll define myself. I do this, I do that, I'm like this, I'm like that." But it's not imprisoning the being in any way. You understand? So yeah, very beautiful. Thank you.</span>

<span class="paragraph">One thing is, over time, you've seen it enough, and even in the middle of it you know, "Well, this is a process that's (take it lightly) somewhat unreal. It's kind of created. I've made this, somehow. It's not as real as it seems to be." And just that knowledge helps to lessen its impact. Does that make sense? So that becomes stronger and stronger, more and more embedded. We believe less in the <a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a> that <a data-href="hindrances" class="internal-link">hindrances</a> and <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>, etc., are telling us, because we've seen it over and over, how they build things, how they want to make [issues], and we believe it less. So that helps defuse, even if you're in the middle of it.</span>

##### Alternatively, come back to a very simple level of the practice, or just be with the unpleasantness

<span class="paragraph">Secondly, it's possible, even if you're in the middle of it, to find a way of working that's simpler. For instance, just keeping doing the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_. You're just coming back to a very simple level instead of trying to engage with the complexity of this sort of raging fire or the complexity of all this difficulty that's going on. Instead of trying to address it at that level, trying to address it at a much simpler level, just keeping doing the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ and staying very simple with that, or possible also to just be with the unpleasantness of what's going on. So once these hooks are in something, they're shaking something, it's probably going to be agitated and unpleasant. You can just feel that energetically, physically, as an unpleasantness, and just stay with that unpleasantness. It's a very simple stratum of <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> to be with. If you stay there and just let it be unpleasant, you're not building it any more. Does that make sense? So two ways there. Good? Okay, great.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Yogi: Can you talk something about effort?

##### Be willing to experiment with the whole range of it

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Yeah. Um. [laughs] Golden question. I don't think there's one answer to that, unfortunately. I don't think it's that simple. In the course of practice, and in the course of a <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> like this, it's more like, "How willing am I to experiment with the whole range of it?" Sometimes what really is needed is this, "Right, okay, when the tough get going ..." What is it? "When the tough get going, the going gets ..." [laughter] "When the going gets tough" - thank you. You know, it's really just, you just stick in there, and you just say, "I'm just going to stick with this thing, and I'm just going to see it out," and it pays off. And it really is a question of effort. And that's kind of one extreme. At other times, it's more of just allowing and really non-efforting, and being very <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a> and allowing, and _that_ seems to be the ticket. Again, it's this responsiveness, this creativity, this aliveness of response and relationship with the practice. ==And I think 'willingness' is a really important word - willing to try everything, even when we feel like, "I don't really want to try that end of things,"== or "That can't be right," you know? ==It's not the case that one thing is always going to work. It's just not. One day, one hour, one approach will work. The next hour, the very opposite. So it's more in this willingness to experiment, and willingness to sometimes do what you don't feel like doing, and sometimes it's very much the opposite.== I wish it _was_ a very simple sort of, "There you are." But I don't think it is. ==I think it's really the whole range of that. But certainly the allowing the <a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a>, the <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a>, is very significant. You can be <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a> of a lot of <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> in that. <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> has a lot to do with <a data-href="tiredness" class="internal-link">tiredness</a>. When there's <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> around, it's just very tiring. So <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a>, being <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a>, actually allows that to just let go.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">Yogi 2: <a data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">Letting go</a> ...? Sorry.</span>
<span class="paragraph">Rob: <a data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">Letting go</a> and being <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a> allows the <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> to go, and then the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> can actually settle, because <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> unsettles the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> and tires the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>. So there's always more than one approach, and always, always it's the case that it's not one thing that's going to just be what's working. Is that ...?</span>
<span class="paragraph">Yogi: Yes. I've been trying to experiment.</span>

This is really important. ==When we think about _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_, the whole picture is important.

<span class="paragraph">Yogi: Just to go back to what you were saying about the hooks getting in and recognizing that. So I've sort of, for the last year or so, managed to get that part, with the negative <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind state" data-href="Mind state" class="internal-link">mind states</a> - "Oh, that's what it is. Okay, that's ... you know, let that go." But with the positive <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind state" data-href="Mind state" class="internal-link">mind states</a> that come up in the midst of the phrases, doing the phrases, and then the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> goes to a positive <a data-href="mind state" class="internal-link">mind state</a>, to the face of somebody that you - you know, like your child or someone like that.

<span class="paragraph">Rob: This is quite interesting as well. In a way, as practice develops and deepens, it's a bit like riding currents, like if you see sometimes there are hawks around here, and you see them kind of gliding and riding the air currents. A positive <a data-href="mind state" class="internal-link">mind state</a> might come up - your child, a loved one, and there's <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> there. Now, it may be that that feels like a bit of a distraction. But it may be that you can also use that <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> as something that feeds back into the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Rob: Okay. If there's _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ in it - in other words, it goes back to the phrases as well. If it feels like, "Oh, here in this memory of this person is _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_," then go with that. In other words, ride it as a manifestation of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, or pull the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ out of it. Does that make sense? There could be a lot of _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ in what you're talking about; it's not just a distraction. Similarly, this morning we were talking about sexual <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> and when there's <a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a> coming up or whatever, opening to that <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> and allowing that, feeling it physically, instead of being so much, "Oh, I need, I need, I want," or so much caught in the <a data-href="fantasy" class="internal-link">fantasy</a>. ==It's an <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> that one can actually ride and navigate. What seems like a distraction can actually be - you can work with it.== So sometimes the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> moves, and it _is_ just looking for a distraction. But then it doesn't actually feel that good. So this is interesting. Again, if you have the sensitivity to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, you can feel when it feels, "Ah, this is actually good. It's helping. It's helping this good feeling." And other times when it's just - it's not really helping.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Similarly, we were talking about eye contact and what <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Catherine McGee" data-href="Catherine McGee" class="internal-link">Catherine</a> mentioned in the opening talk, and I said today, "Let yourself look at who you pass in the corridor, and the lovely" - not all the time; you don't have to go around grinning at everyone.

See if you can notice when it's coming out of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">restlessness</a> and distraction and wanting just to entertain, and when it's actually coming out of wanting to look and appreciate.
