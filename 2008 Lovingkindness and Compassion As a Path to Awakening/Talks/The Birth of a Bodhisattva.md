[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva -|plain list]]

##### Two central aspirations for a bodhisattva: boundless compassion and understanding emptiness
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^1-1" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^1-1" class="internal-link">1-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhism</a> · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> · <a data-href="Bodhisattva" class="internal-link">Bodhisattva</a> (2) · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> (4) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (5) · <a data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">Emptiness</a> (3) · <a data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">Phenomenon</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (3) · <a data-href="Death" class="internal-link">Death</a> · <a data-href="Rebirth" class="internal-link">Rebirth</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11954/20080212-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_birth_of_a_bodhisattva-11954.mp3#t=00:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">In the tradition, in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddhism" data-href="Buddhism" class="internal-link">Buddhist tradition</a>, the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> traditions, there is the concept and the idea of the <a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a>. And that's been actually around since the beginning. And about 500, between 500 and 1,000 years - my maths isn't very good, but _a while_ after the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> died ... [laughter] It gained quite a central significance and a slightly different meaning. And what it came to mean in the tradition was someone who aspired very highly with two central aspirations. And one was the aspiration of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, of boundless <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, and serving life, serving other beings. And the other was - and sometimes this is, interestingly, neglected - to fully understand the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness of all things</a>, of all <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a>. And those two together - so it's the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> and the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> together - make up that aspiration to live that way, to fulfil both of those potentials, make up the <a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a>. And actually it was originally meant as someone who vowed to become a <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> in a future life. But this came about historically - and historians are a little bit unclear when exactly it emerged and how it emerged and where it emerged in the tradition. But it was felt among, obviously, certain practitioners that a while after the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a>, there was not quite a full enough <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> of what the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> originally said - and so that's where the <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> piece comes in - and also that somehow the emphasis on <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> had slipped a little bit, and a lot of people were practising just for themselves. So this <a data-href="rebirth" class="internal-link">rebirth</a> of the emphasis on <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> and fullness of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> on <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>.</span>

##### A Bodhisattva lives their life with compassion at the centre of their priority
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^1-2" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Bodhisattva" class="internal-link">Bodhisattva</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (5) · <a data-href="Centre" class="internal-link">Centre</a> · <a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a> · <a data-href="Shantideva" class="internal-link">Shantideva</a> · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Death" class="internal-link">Death</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11954/20080212-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_birth_of_a_bodhisattva-11954.mp3#t=02:28" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So a <a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a> is really someone who is totally devoted to <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, who lives their life with <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> at the <a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a>, at the core of their priority. Their whole life is kind of revolving around <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, revolving around the wish, the <a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a>, to serve others. There's a text by <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Shantideva" data-href="Shantideva" class="internal-link">Śāntideva</a>, I think eighth century, quite some years after the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a>, and in a way, it's the epitome of the sort of expression of this aspiration. There are a few extracts from this I'd like to read. Has anyone read from this on this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> - no, one of us teachers on this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>? It's expressing this yearning, this wish, this surrender to the centrality of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, and the movement of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> in one's life.</span>

##### Santideva expressing this yearning to surrender to the centrality of compassion

<span class="paragraph">> I am medicine for the sick and weary. May I be their physician and their nurse until disease appears no more.<br/>May I strike down the anguish of thirst and hunger with rains of food and drink.

##### Maybe this aspiration doesn't necessarily need to take birth in a sudden way, but can rather be a gradual movement
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^2-3" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Shantideva" class="internal-link">Shantideva</a> · <a data-href="Bodhisattvacaryavatara" class="internal-link">Bodhisattvacaryavatara</a> · <a data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">Consciousness</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3) · <a data-href="Birth" class="internal-link">Birth</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11954/20080212-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_birth_of_a_bodhisattva-11954.mp3#t=05:42" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">It's very, very powerful. Very beautiful passage. When <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Shantideva" data-href="Shantideva" class="internal-link">Śāntideva</a>, in the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Bodhisattvacaryavatara" data-href="Bodhisattvacaryavatara" class="internal-link">Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra</a>_ (that extract's from that) where he puts these ideas forth and this aspiration forth, the chapter before that, it comes, it bursts - he describes it _bursting_ into his <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> as a kind of explosion of this aspiration for <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, very sudden. But I wonder, you know, alongside - with the language being extremely ornate and extreme and colourful - I wonder if that's also an exaggeration, and if this aspiration towards <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> necessarily needs to take <a data-href="birth" class="internal-link">birth</a> in a sudden way. You know, sudden equals dramatic, and people like that because it's like, "Ooh!" But I wonder if this movement towards making <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> central can actually be a gradual movement. Does it need to be sudden? Or both?</span>

##### What allows this kind of compassion to arise and stay?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^2-4" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^2-4" class="internal-link">2-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (10) · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (2) · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11954/20080212-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_birth_of_a_bodhisattva-11954.mp3#t=06:44" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And the question I want to go into today is, what allows that kind of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, first of all to be there, to arise, but second of all to actually stay, to stay there? <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> like that, a huge <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, to have <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> be central in one's life, to have <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> be central, it needs - the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> needs an unshakeability to it. Somehow in the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> there needs to be a real sense of, yeah, unshakeability, that it will stand up in the face of whatever <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> and all <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. ==So the bigger the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, in a way, the bigger the unshakeability it needs, the bigger the foundation.== So this is really what I want to go into today. And this is where the fourth _brahmavihāra_, <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, comes in. How does that come into <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, to allow the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> to be stronger and more stable?</span>

##### Four brahmaviharas; mudita
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^2-5" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^2-5" class="internal-link">2-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">Brahmaviharas</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> · <a data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">Mudita</a> (4) · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (6) · <a data-href="Catherine McGee" class="internal-link">Catherine McGee</a> (2) · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11954/20080212-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_birth_of_a_bodhisattva-11954.mp3#t=07:53" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So, there are these four _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a>_: _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_, <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">muditā</a>_ (<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, which <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Catherine McGee" data-href="Catherine McGee" class="internal-link">Catherine</a> talked about yesterday), and <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. And I'm sure <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Catherine McGee" data-href="Catherine McGee" class="internal-link">Catherine</a> said this, but just to say, _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">muditā</a>_ oftentimes gets translated as '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">sympathetic joy</a>,' <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> of others. But really it's something much broader than that. It's, you could say, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">spiritual joy</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> that doesn't depend on the ego. So <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> that doesn't depend on me getting something, you telling me how wonderful I am, me getting anything. It's not about the ego. It's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> that's coming from an openness, being touched in life.</span>

##### Equanimity in its relationship to compassion
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^3-1" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^3-1" class="internal-link">3-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">Mudita</a> · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> (6) · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11954/20080212-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_birth_of_a_bodhisattva-11954.mp3#t=08:35" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And so, there's _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">muditā</a>_, and there's this last _brahmavihāra_, <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, or _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity" data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">upekkhā</a>_. Now, when the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> talked about <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, most of the time he meant <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> in relation to all things and all conditions. So it wasn't just in relationship to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> of beings. So in a way, it has two meanings. One is a very broad meaning: just stable, steady, remaining open in the face of whatever happens, whatever conditions there are, whatever conditions arise. And then the almost like 'smaller' meaning, which is actually what I want to go into more today: <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> in its relationship to <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, the way that <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> needs to be there at the base of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> to make that <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> really, really unshakeable.</span>

##### Sometimes we help and it gets better, sometimes not, and that's where equanimity needs to come in
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^3-2" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^3-2" class="internal-link">3-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So that, in our lives or in our practices, we give <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> to beings. Or we help beings - we work in service or whatever it is. We work to help others. And oftentimes that helps. What we do helps. It's a factor that helps. But sometimes we're wishing <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, we're meditating, we're actively involved in helping, and it doesn't help. It's just, the person is still <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> or getting worse. So this is really where the <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> needs to come in.</span>

##### Recap: balancing of receiving and giving

<span class="paragraph">So, questions: how does that come into the practice? How do we bring that in, in a very deep way, to the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practice, this <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>? This will be the last time I say this piece, on this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> at least, if you can stand it one more time: this balance, balance in the practice that I talk about - ==when we talk about <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> in the <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>, there's the taking in, the <a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a>, the tuning into the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> of another, letting the heart resonate, letting that sorrow resonate in the heart, the receiving of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. And the balancing of that with the <a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a> <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> that goes out, the balm, that which soothes, that which helps. And feeling that <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> on its way out, the balm, the <a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a>, because it bathes oneself on the way out, and it's actually pleasant, and it's actually happy, even if it's just quietly happy, and it's actually nourishing.==</span>

##### Develop the skill to find the dynamic balance
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^3-4" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^3-4" class="internal-link">3-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Empathy" class="internal-link">Empathy</a> · <a data-href="Grief" class="internal-link">Grief</a> (3) · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So this is really, really crucial. And as I said, the balance won't be a set point. It will be dynamic. It will be moving back and forth. But we can develop this skill where we're actually aware where the balance is at any point in time. Am I too long in the <a data-href="empathy" class="internal-link">empathy</a> side? Too long with the <a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a> of it? Do I need to sit more in the other side, feeling the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a> of it? There _will_ be <a data-href="grief" class="internal-link">grief</a>. There will be. And it's a beautiful thing when the heart opens and there are tears at the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the world, the huge amount of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the world, or those that we know. And the heart resonates with that. ==And it's a beautiful, precious treasure of what it is to be human, to live in the fullness of our humanity, that we _will_ feel that, and we _will_ shed tears, and we _will_ feel that grief.==</span>

##### You can take the skill from the cushion into the personal life

<span class="paragraph">But unless, in a long-term way, unless we get this, take care of this balance, the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> won't have strength and sustainability to it. And that's what we're really talking about: sustainability. What gives <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> - just that it lasts, it can really last? It's really, really important. Now, I'm talking in terms of very specific nuts and bolts of technique with this. But the beautiful thing is it _translates_. Develop the skill on the cushion, in the <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> hall, of this balance, and it translates when you're sitting opposite someone, listening to them. You're holding their hand. You're with someone. You can actually take that same skill that came from the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation practice</a> and translate it into the personal, when you're talking, when you're listening, etc. It's just a skill. But this is really, really fundamental, and it gives the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> a sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">buoyancy</a>. So as I said, how common it is for people to do the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practice and then just feel sunk under it, _burdened_ by <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. Often doesn't take very long. Come on a <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> like this, a couple of days, and it's like, "_Phew_! Can we move on to the next one?" So it gives it a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">buoyancy</a>, a balance, a <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a>, and this unshakeable quality, all of which are factors of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> coming in.</span>

##### Samadhi as less distractedness is more steadiness in the mind

<span class="paragraph">And then - again, also to repeat something else I've said a few times - the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_. So I'm just harping on and on about _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_. In its most fundamental sense, _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ as non-distractedness - or _less_ distractedness, put it that way - because, again, please remember it's a continuum, _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_. And I can't remember if I said this the other day, but there's such a tendency to think, "Oh, I have it," "I don't have it, and if I don't have it, then I'm a failure," and <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>-judge comes in. It's a continuum. But generally speaking, _less_ distractedness - there's actually more <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> in the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>. You can actually see that. So it's a simple equation: less distractedness, more <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a>. And that <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> begins to absorb into the being in all kinds of ways. So not to neglect the power of the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_.</span>

<span class="paragraph">When we're doing the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practice, it's very common and very normal to have a sense of <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> doing the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>: here I am, sitting and walking and kind of flapping as much as I can and trying to generate some <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. And that's very normal. It's very natural. <a data-href="The self" class="internal-link">The self</a> is doing the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. And sometimes, _sometimes_ - and I'm sure some of you have tasted this to some degree or other - again, as the practice deepens, as the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ deepens, there can be a sense that it's less <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> doing it. There's just a sense of almost effortlessness, or less effort, less self behind it and more just <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> _present_. There seems to be less _doing_. Now, it can be common, if one gets a taste of that at times, to neglect kind of the doing of the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> and to think, "Well, the really proper <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is when I don't feel like I'm doing it, or when it doesn't feel to be much self in it." But the whole range is important. And this is really, really important to keep in <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>. The whole range of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> and how <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> feels is important to us.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So sometimes, it _does_ feel like, "Here I am, flapping and huffing and puffing and trying to get the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> going." There's very much the _self_, _this self_ giving <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> to _that self -_ very much about self and other, absolutely necessary and fine, and important. So this doing _is_ an aspect of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> wants to alleviate <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, and there's a doing in that. There are also the other aspects of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, receiving and holding <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, definitely. But there's also a doing involved. So, you know, if we are in the presence of a child that's starving, we don't say, you know, "I'm feeling really receptive. Tell me all about it. I'm all ears."

<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11954/20080212-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_birth_of_a_bodhisattva-11954.mp3#t=20:05" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">I remember, five years ago or something, being <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a> here for three months and at some point getting ill (I can't remember when it was) at some point in the <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>. And getting ill with a flare-up of Crohn's disease, which is something I suffer from, from time to time. And this is a disease - some of you may know - where they haven't really figured out a cause for it. They don't really understand it. And so, my particular personality, what happens to _me_ when I get it is one part of my being tries to figure it out. And I start experimenting with diet and this alternative and that, and sort of taking notes, and ... [laughs] And I just, you know, it's just my personality. I can't help it. Well, I probably could. But anyway ... [laughter] What I noticed at that time was there were two modes:</span>

---
##### 1. mode: just being with that
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^5-5" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^5-5" class="internal-link">5-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Pain" class="internal-link">Pain</a> · <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11954/20080212-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_birth_of_a_bodhisattva-11954.mp3#t=21:06" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(1)** One, I was <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a>, which is a very 'nothing to do, nowhere to go' mode. And I could just sit with the discomfort of it and the <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a> of it and the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a>, etc., and just hold all that in <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> and non-doing - just being with that, just letting that be held. And that was one mode, which was a very beautiful way of being with something very difficult.</span>

---
##### 2. mode: trying to figure out what would bring healing
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^5-6" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^5-6" class="internal-link">5-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Healing" class="internal-link">Healing</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11954/20080212-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_birth_of_a_bodhisattva-11954.mp3#t=21:31" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(2)** And then another mode was very much about doing and trying to take care of myself and trying to figure out what the best thing - what would bring <a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a>.</span>

---
##### Both modes are necessary
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^5-7" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^5-7" class="internal-link">5-7</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">_Both_ are necessary. Just to watch - sometimes, what I noticed was the more that I got into the 'figuring out' mode, out of wanting to heal, oftentimes it felt the more removed I was from the kind of holding of the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> and the sense of that, the sweetness of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, in a way.</span>

##### Acknowledge that with compassion there is a range
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^6-1" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^6-1" class="internal-link">6-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">_Both_ are necessary though. It's really important to acknowledge that with <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, it really is a range, and _all_ of that is <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. Even when it looks like one is just tearing one's hair out trying to figure something out or trying to help someone, it's still the expression of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> - very much so.</span>

##### A space of compassion
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^6-2" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^6-2" class="internal-link">6-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (2) · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Sometimes, as has been mentioned, the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practice can seem, at times, for some people, can seem as if it opens out or drops into a whole other sense. There really is a spectrum here. And it's almost like a space of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> opens up, a space. And in that space, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> is held, that whatever <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> arises is held in that space. It's a space of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. And it could feel like it's a space within us, or it could feel like it's a vast space (and we've touched on this before in this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>), a space that's actually the size of the universe. It's infinite.</span>

##### The more we encourage this spaciousness, the more suffering can be effortlessly held in it

<span class="paragraph">This is a very real <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a> that can arise for different people at different times. <a data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">Spaciousness</a> is also a quality, an _aspect_ of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> - very much so. When there's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, a <a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a> around that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> is a colour, a face, of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. ==In this practice, the more that we can actually encourage and dwell in that <a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a>, where whatever <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> there is or whatever <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> could possibly arise in the universe, it actually is effortlessly held. And we can begin to get glimpses of that <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> and then actually <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nurture</a> it.== We can learn to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nurture</a> that <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> as a very real <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a> that begins, again, in a very real way, to change our whole relationship with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the world and in ourselves and in this life. That it moves more and more from 'little old me' who has to hold this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> to a kind of - it's just held, and one knows it's held, and one feels it's held. And in that vastness of holding, there's <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> with the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, mixed in with the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And sometimes, for some people, this can be a very - well, almost always is a very beautiful sense, even a mystical or a religious sense, and that's very much a part of it. The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a> can change. They can open out. And something very beautiful is born there which we can then ... not _snatch_ at and not try to _keep_, but encourage, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nurture</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourish</a> that opening of the <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a>. And it's a gradual thing, but it's definitely possible. A lot of transformation comes from that.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Someone wrote me a little note with a poem that she'd found from Rilke.^[Rainer Maria Rilke, "Autumn," tr. Jonathan Cott. Archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20201102174022/http://www.monadnockmama.com/poem-for-an-autumn-day] It's very lovely. It speaks to this sense of the holding being something almost religious, or simply religious.</span>

##### This can take on a very personal flavour

<span class="paragraph">Very beautiful, speaking about this holding, which for some people takes a very personal flavour. And in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tibetan Buddhism" data-href="Tibetan Buddhism" class="internal-link">Tibetan traditions</a> and other of the Buddhist traditions, very much the relationship with the <a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a>, the relationship with the guru or the root guru, as someone one prays to, as someone who's actually holding, in the vastness of their <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>, one's own <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. And you get the same thing in mystical <a data-href="Christianity" class="internal-link">Christianity</a>, that the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Jesus" data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">cosmic Christ</a> or the <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> of Christ is actually holding the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the universe. That could be personal, but it could also be impersonal - don't need to necessarily introduce any figure into it. And people are different, and they have different <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">tendencies</a>. This is a tendency that can open. It brings a lot of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. One possibility.</span>

##### The aspiration of a bodhisattva is mind-blowingly high
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^6-8" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^6-8" class="internal-link">6-8</a>**: _<a data-href="Bodhisattva" class="internal-link">Bodhisattva</a> · <a data-href="Shantideva" class="internal-link">Shantideva</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">When we speak, when we use the language of '<a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a>,' and especially when we hear <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Shantideva" data-href="Shantideva" class="internal-link">Śāntideva</a> and this kind of thing, it's an incredibly high aspiration. I mean, it's almost like <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>-blowingly high, _almost_ unreal. When we hear it, it's almost - I mean, that's the flavour that comes off, is a kind of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>-boggling unreality to it. And yet there are people who take it on. It comes to become something real for them. It translates in a way that becomes something real. But whether we're moved by that or repelled by that, that's actually not what I want to so much dwell on. I want to go into, what allows _our_ <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> - wherever we are in that - to become unshakeable, or more and more unshakeable?</span>

##### We have to respect where we are in our humanity
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^7-1" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^7-1" class="internal-link">7-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Bodhisattva" class="internal-link">Bodhisattva</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> · <a data-href="Hell" class="internal-link">Hell</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">Letting go</a> · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So we can have a sense of '<a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a>' being a very high aspiration. We also need to respect: "Where are we? Where am I in all this? How is it for me right now, when I'm in a situation with someone that's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, someone I know or don't know or I care about? Where am I _really_ in my humanity?" And sometimes - you know, this is really something, I think, to give very careful <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to in our life - sometimes we neglect ourselves and our needs. ==Sometimes we're _too_ cautious perhaps. And perhaps there _is_ a place for stretching ourselves, stretching our limits, just saying, "To <a data-href="hell" class="internal-link">hell</a> with myself and my self-concern," and just a kind of abandon. Maybe that has its place. Or rather, it definitely has its place, but it needs to be approached with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a>. And stretching the limits of one's stamina and one's endurance in serving and in giving - there is the place for that.== And I'm not necessarily talking about something, you know, like literally giving up one's life. I'm just talking about little ways. Just <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a> of <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>-concern. Sometimes - and you must have come across this - you're doing the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ or the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> practice, and something's not feeling quite right for _you_. ==Either the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>'s niggling, or something's not right. It can be very skilful to just drop in, "It doesn't matter how I feel right now. It doesn't matter. I'm just giving the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> to you." You can just play with this kind of abandonment of self-concern - not all the time, but just sometimes.==</span>

##### It can happen that we feel that our needs are not being met
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^7-2" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^7-2" class="internal-link">7-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> · <a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (3) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">But this is a very delicate area and needs a lot of careful <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a>. Sometimes we need to ask, "What are my needs, what are _my_ needs, in this situation? What are my <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a> too?" I'm sure many of you have had a situation, or have situations, where we are in a relationship or a friendship or a situation with someone where they are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. The other is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. And perhaps it's going on for quite a while. It's chronic. And we are in a caretaking role in some form or another. So maybe it's just a friendship. And sometimes, even in a friendship or relationship with a person who is bringing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> on themselves, and you can see that because of the choices they're making towards, whatever it is, alcohol, drugs, the way they're living - you can just see, and yet you care about this person, and you want to live with <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> there. And one can very understandably, very naturally feel in that situation, "Here, in the ongoingness of this relationship, my needs are not being met."</span>

##### It's especially difficult if the person is bringing the suffering on for themselves
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^7-3" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^7-3" class="internal-link">7-3</a>**: _<a data-href="History" class="internal-link">History</a> · <a data-href="Energy" class="internal-link">Energy</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">And so this is, I think, very common when one finds oneself in this situation with a friend or any kind of relationship where this is going on in. And especially difficult when the person seems to be bringing it on for themselves, if you've ever been close with an addict or something like that. It's a very difficult relationship to keep and keep healthy. And the question, am I taking care of my needs in this situation? Am I taking care of my needs? Not easy. Because there will be in that - if there's friendship, and if there's a <a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a> of friendship and relationship - there will be loneliness that comes in. Sometimes it can feel like the person is just not available. Either they literally don't have the <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a> to be there, or they're just checked out. And there can be loneliness come in. We don't feel met. We don't feel seen. We don't feel like there's a flow of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and friendship there. We don't feel loved.</span>

And it can also be complicated by other factors. Sometimes we're with someone who's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, and we actually, if we're honest, we look inside, we notice, or we may notice, we want to be needed. We want to be needed. And so, in a way, this is a very weird one. Something in us actually has an investment in keeping the other <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> because - and this is a horrible word, but in some psychotherapies they call it =='co-dependency.' It's actually a mutual investment in someone <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> and the other person kind of wanting to keep them down.==</span>

##### Is it possible to get what we need in a healthy way?

<span class="paragraph">We have to ask, "Do I want to feel needed? Do I need to feel needed? What's going on there if I do? Do I want to be recognized for my efforts, for the efforts of service and care?" So these are not easy questions. And in a way, some of that is just human. When we give service, when we give, when we're compassionate, there is a part of us, a very natural human part that wants to be - wants our efforts to be recognized. So the question is, or a question is, is it possible to get what we need in a healthy way - in a _healthy_ way, that it's not coming into the relationship in an undercurrent, undercover way, that we're actually conscious and getting what we need in a healthy way? Not easy, not easy territory at all.</span>

##### What is it that helps the compassion to stay strong?

<span class="paragraph">Oftentimes, though, we don't have that same kind of self-interest. It's not a friend or a relative or a partner or whatever that we're working with. There isn't that self-interest. But still the question, what is it that allows, that helps, the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> to stay strong, to stay steady, to stay tender? ==So when I say 'strength,' I really mean to stay open, that the heart stays open, and stays soft and tender.== What allows that? Often in the world we do see - it's clear. We look at another, and we can see. We look at others, and we see they are, you could say - one way of putting it is they're causing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> for themselves or others, and out of <a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a>. They're just not seeing the consequences of their actions or their way of being. And it's clear, and we look and we see that. And this is partly why <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> is - why I want to speak about it. It's so important. The <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> needs to come in.</span>

##### The near enemy of equanimity is indifference, sometimes couched in spiritual language

<span class="paragraph">Remember we talked about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Near enemy" data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemies</a>? And <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Near enemy" data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemies</a> of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Near enemy" data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemies</a> of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. A <a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a> of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> - something that _looks_ like it but on closer inspection is really _not_ it - the <a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a> of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> is indifference. It's just, the heart's actually shut down, cold, disinterested, disconnected, whereas <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> is actually open. It's still tender. It's still soft. It's interested. It's present. So oftentimes, indifference can even be dressed up in spiritual language. But it's not <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. Spiritual language in different traditions, you know, we have the notion of <a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a>. And how often people - the temptation is to hear, "They're <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>" - the attitude - "It's just their <a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a>. It's their <a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a>, and they need to go through it." That's an Eastern concept. Or in the West, it's, you know, "God's punishing them," or something. These are taking spiritual concepts and using them in immature <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understandings</a>. Rather to ask, "What is my responsibility to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>?" This is a huge question: "What's my responsibility? What's my response-ability, my ability to respond? What is my response?"</span>

##### Compassion needs wisdom and faith in it
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^8-5" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^8-5" class="internal-link">8-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (3) · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (3) · <a data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">Devotion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> · <a data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">Dependent Origination</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, and particularly <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> with <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> in it, has two factors which I want to say a bit about and talk around for a little bit. <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> needs to have <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> in it, and it needs to have <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a> in it. I want to talk around this for a little bit; it needs to have <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a>. And this is at all kinds of different levels. So at a very sort of, I don't know, is it mundane level, perhaps, one aspect of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> is just realizing the limits of our actions. So very easy to see this in the context of a political context, the limits, even in a democracy. You know, the tendency is to think, "What difference does it make if I vote or not?" Or certainly to see it very clearly with globalization. ==To realize the actual limits of one's actions and just to see: we are limited. Or even in other contexts, you have to see that here, one may be giving service or acting compassionately or trying to alleviate the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, and it's only one strand in a web of conditions.== So what we do, what we choose to do, how we act and speak is just one strand in a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">web of conditions</a>, in a web of interdependence.</span>

##### Example: giving a talk

<span class="paragraph">For example, I mean, it's interesting giving talks, for many reasons. But one gives a talk, and one wants to help. One wants to offer something to help. And it's important, you know, for me to reflect, and I think for everyone who's doing this kind of thing, or any kind of act, to reflect that one gives a talk - there's so much going on. Like right now, there's so much going on making up this talk. It may seem to me or to you that _I'm_ giving the talk. Now, of course, at one level, I am. But actually, and if anyone has ever been involved in any kind of performing art, what you become aware of is, the talk is actually a collaboration. I'm actually doing most of the talking. [laughter] Although this group's interesting! [laughter] But anyway, it's actually a collaboration. So I still have this piece of paper and the notes and what I want to get through in the course of the talk. But there's something in the way everyone is present or not present, wakeful or not wakeful, interested or not, _everything_ - you know, if you ate too much for lunch, that's going to affect this talk. Thank you very much. [laughter] It's a totally collaborative effort. So what comes out of the mouth, the whole <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>, the whole feel of it is actually a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a>.

<span class="paragraph">If I, in wanting to serve, in wanting to give something, am too much seeing it from <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a> - there's just one strand there. It's just one strand. And then the words come out, and _some_ of them are heard - let's be honest - _some_ of them are heard and some not. And its effects also, a whole - where's it landing? It's landing in a lot of different <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind state" data-href="Mind state" class="internal-link">mind states</a>. It's landing in a lot of different practice histories. It's landing in a lot of different life situations. And one will leave this talk, this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, and go out and meet a whole set of other conditions. ==So a talk, or a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma teaching</a>, or whatever it is, an <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>, is actually just a seed. And then it needs to meet a lot of other conditions.== Now if I, in willing <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, in giving, see myself as _too_ much of an instrument, or _too_ significant of an instrument, that's where my <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is going to get too wobbly.

<span class="paragraph">So, you know, we talked about <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> the other night - _very_ hard to understand subject, very difficult subject to understand just intellectually, and then to really absorb that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>. For me, it's much more helpful to see something like that, a talk like that - "It's just a seed. It's just a seed." And then perhaps it will meet other seeds, and there will be growing. But if I think, "Right, by starting the talk at 7:30, by 8:30, everyone in this room needs to ..." [laughs] It's too much! ==Beings that we are helping, we need to remember, after this interaction, after this giving of the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, they go on, and they meet, they will meet, other conditions and other influences. I am not the sole provider of conditions and compassion.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">There are a few very interesting passages from the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sutta" data-href="Sutta" class="internal-link">suttas</a>, from the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>. I'm not quite sure where to put them in. I'll put them in here, in terms of conditions. He's talking about <a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a>, and he's talking about the ripening of <a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a> from the past. So this could be, we've done something that we regret, and then we feel the <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a> of that regret, that remorse or guilt. Or it could be that something bad has happened to us, and we have that memory. Something from the past is having its effect in the present: <a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a>. He says something very interesting in a few different passages. ==When the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, when the heart, is small, restricted, that <a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a> ripens - the memory of what we did, or what happened to us or whatever - ripens in that context of the restricted, the constricted heart. In the unrestricted heart, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Immeasurability" data-href="Immeasurability" class="internal-link">immeasurable</a> heart - so one that is either <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Immeasurability" data-href="Immeasurability" class="internal-link">immeasurable</a> through <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> or <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, one of the _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a>_, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Immeasurability" data-href="Immeasurability" class="internal-link">immeasurable</a> that way, or unrestricted through _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ or through <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> - in the unrestricted heart, when that <a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a> ripens, when it comes up, when the memory comes up or the effects from the past come up, memory or otherwise, it's in a very different context. And the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> said it will barely be noticed.== The <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a> from the past, the <a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a> from the past will barely be noticed when the heart is really, really open like that. So this is a very powerful, very striking and powerful teaching.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**Yogi 2**: Is that a continuum then, Rob? So you're kind of saying, the more constricted the heart, the smaller the space in the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, the bigger the <a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a> will be, the wider?</span>

<span class="paragraph">**Rob**: Absolutely, very much, yeah. So it's a real - all this that I'm talking about is a continuum. Yeah, very important. So the smaller the heart, at any time, the <a data-href="karma" class="internal-link">karma</a> comes up - extremely massive effect. The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> gives a few analogies - one of them is a salt crystal in a cup of water. How does the water taste after that? Pretty salty. Salt crystal in a huge lake, barely noticeable. And the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> says it will come up, but barely noticeable, barely making an impression when the heart is really ... So ==even when beings are <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, there is the condition that they meet of what the heart is at any time in the future.== Another analogy he gives is - and this just says something about the sort of judicial system of his time, but also at this time in different countries - that if you're a poor man, you can be thrown in jail for a long, long time, and no one cares, and you just get stuck in jail. But if you're a wealthy man, it doesn't happen. You don't get stuck in jail for a long time. You don't get thrown in jail. Not a very nice analogy, but the riches of the - again, what we're nurturing inside and the openness of the heart, the <a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a> of this as a real wealth, _real_ wealth.^[The Buddha's words about the unrestricted, immeasurable heart, together with his analogies of the salt crystal and the poor man thrown in jail, are found at AN 3:101, _Loṇaphala Sutta_]</span>

<span class="paragraph">So <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> has, as I said, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a> in it. <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> has <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a> in it, and I want to go into this a little bit, what this might mean.

And when I was there, I came across the story of <a data-href="Maximilian Kolbe" class="internal-link">Maximilian Kolbe</a> - hope I remember it. He was a Polish man who became a Franciscan priest and monk ('Franciscan' is a denomination of Catholic monk and priest), I think in his early twenties, and lived in Poland and some time in Asia. And then the Nazis overtook Poland, and he was thrown in jail immediately just as a suspect, because of being a monk and a Catholic. And then released.</span>

##### Punishment for escaped prisoner

<span class="paragraph">He went back to his friary and hid - some way or another - hid 3,000 Polish refugees there, 2,000 of whom were Jewish. And he hid them there, obviously under great danger to himself, great threat to himself. After a while, it was found out, and he and some of his colleagues were sent to Auschwitz, in the early part of the camp's existence. And after he'd been there a few months, just a couple of months, one day in his block, in his cell block, a prisoner went missing. And so the assumption on behalf of the Nazi guards was that this prisoner had escaped. It actually turned out that he had drowned in a latrine either by suicide or accident. But anyway, the assumption was that he had escaped, and the punishment if a person escaped from a cell block was that ten men were chosen at random and executed from that cell block. And so, ten were chosen from his block, and one of them, one of these ten, on being chosen - he was actually a Polish resistance fighter who was in Auschwitz. There were a lot of political prisoners in Auschwitz at the time. And one of them immediately broke down. He was picked as one of the ten. He immediately broke down: "How are my wife and children going to get on without me? You know, I've got young children. I've got a wife." And he immediately broke down. Didn't make any impact.</span>

##### "I will take the place of this man", to starve to death

<span class="paragraph">But then Father Kolbe, <a data-href="Maximilian Kolbe" class="internal-link">Maximilian Kolbe</a>, stepped forward, and he said, "I will take the place of this man." And miraculously the commandant, the Nazi commandant, actually agreed to let this happen. So the punishment - this isn't very nice to hear, but the punishment was that they were thrown into a little room. I've actually seen the room. It's a tiny room, I thought. It was so tiny, I thought they must have died from asphyxiation, but actually they were left there to starve. And so just thrown into this little room at the bottom of the stairs and left there to starve. And usually people would last a few days before, basically, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> starts to decompose. After two weeks, the camp authorities needed to put more victims in the room, basically, so they went down to clear it out and found four of them still alive. Three of them were not conscious but still alive, and there was the last one still alive, which was actually Father Kolbe. And they killed - well, the camp executioner killed them with lethal injection. That's how they killed them. And he was completely conscious at the time of his <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So, not a very nice story to hear. But one <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Wonder" data-href="Wonder" class="internal-link">wonders</a>, hearing - so what's going on? What was going on for him? And you know, that's just one story. One could pick out countless <a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a> in the <a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a> of humanity where that kind of level of self-renunciation, self-abandonment is going on in the service of others. What's going on? There's another lovely ... Do you know who <a data-href="Damien the Leper" class="internal-link">Damien the Leper</a> is? Have you heard that? Just briefly, he was also actually a Catholic monk in the Dominican order. At one time, one of the Hawaiian Islands was a leper colony. So they would just use it to keep lepers. No one else lived there but lepers because of the <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> of contagion. And he volunteered to be a minister to the lepers, to go and live out the rest of his life on this island with nothing but thousands and thousands of lepers. And he volunteered to do that. And he was a doctor, and he ministered to them, and he also was their religious minister. Eventually, I think it took twelve years, but he eventually <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">contracted</a> leprosy and eventually died.</span>

##### Beginnings of faith

So we talk about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a>, and we could talk a long time about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a>. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">Faith</a> is a very interesting quality. And again, there's a real spectrum to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a>. So the beginnings of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a>, and particularly if we talk about - we haven't talked much on this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> about a sort of devotional <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a>, and too much about relationship with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Kuan Yin</a> and that kind of thing. Immature <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a>, or the beginnings of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a> that "It will turn out how I want" - or we hear, "It will be all right," but what that really translates as, "It will turn out how I want." And that's the beginnings of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a>, but it's actually an immature <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">A path of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a> and <a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a> - and this is a real path for people who tread it - it actually deepens. It deepens, and it matures. And there's a maturing of what <a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a> means and what <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a> means. And so it moves - it leaves behind 'what I can get,' 'what can I get,' 'what I am asking you for' - I am asking God or <a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a> or Christ or whatever it is, what I'm asking for - it moves away from that. And someone said, not on this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, but just a week or so ago, I was meeting with them, and she said to me, "It feels like the gods have abandoned me." And we explored it, and what she really meant was "I'm not getting what I want."</span>

<span class="paragraph">It transforms, and it deepens, and you know, the beautiful words of <a data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">Jesus</a> in the Garden of Gethsemane - he knows what's coming, and he says, "Thy will be done."^[Matthew 26:42] _Thy_ will, not mine, be done. As I said there's, again, this turning upside down of values, turning inside out: _thy_ will, not mine, be done. And so powerful and so beautiful. There's this movement into - as much as there's a movement of a path of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> into depth, there's a movement of path of <a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a> into depths. And people write about this. <a data-href="St John of the Cross" class="internal-link">St John of the Cross</a> is perhaps one of the most famous ones. ==Moving away from the kind of sense of consolation one gets from God or <a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a> or whatever it is, away from that to _thy will_, and actually into the dark night of the <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a>, where one feels one isn't getting anything.

##### The view of suffering changes
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva > ^12-2" data-href="0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^12-2" class="internal-link">12-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">Devotion</a> (5) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (7)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">So it deepens, but I think, when I reflect on what must have been going on - we don't know what was going on with Father Kolbe. What must have been going on? Something happens in the deepening of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a> and <a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a>. And this is what's perhaps important: the view of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> changes. The view that we have of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> changes. And in this case, it was through <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a>. So you can be - ==_I_ feel pretty sure that Father Kolbe was seeing that situation differently. There was something in the depth of his <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a> and <a data-href="devotion" class="internal-link">devotion</a> and sense of, in this case, sense of God, or whatever you want to call it, something that allowed him to see that situation differently, so that the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> is not the whole of reality. This is very interesting. Or that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> is not as real as it seems. Or that the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, again, is held in something else. It's held in something else. All of these are different views of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. They're different ways that the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> is seen and related to.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">If we talk more in line with sort of typical Buddhist practice, more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Theravada" data-href="Theravada" class="internal-link">Theravāda</a> and that sort of - more what we're familiar with, and we say, "What is <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a>?

<span class="paragraph">**(1)** One is, the first aspect, I think, of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a> is that beautiful - it's also an <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> - beautiful qualities, cultivating beautiful qualities, cultivating this openness of heart and everything that brings that (<a data-href="generosity" class="internal-link">generosity</a> and <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, and _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">samādhi</a>_ and _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>_ and <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, all those qualities), **<a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a> of beautiful qualities brings <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a> and <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> and security**.

It brings an aliveness, an openness, an inquiry, a responsiveness. And this is really, really - in a way, it's such a small shift, but it's so significant.

But I felt, even when the science was uncertain, it's like, well, even if we don't know, or even now, if it's too late, what's the best way to live? What's the best way to live? To choose the acts that are actually difficult, that go out of our way, that maybe involve some renunciation. What's getting fed in that? So maybe it makes a difference, maybe it doesn't. Maybe it's wrong science. Maybe it doesn't. What's getting fed if I just go with the "Maybe it doesn't matter. I'll just carry on as usual"? Maybe just this individual is not going to make a difference, but what's getting fed in this heart and the heart of others when I choose to renounce or whatever it is, or go without, or live differently because it _might_ make a difference?

We can devote ourselves to that in a way that's not attached. So <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> is not something that's dry or cold. It's certainly not <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nihilism" data-href="Nihilism" class="internal-link">nihilistic</a>. It doesn't mean nothing exists, and it's just, "Meh, nothing matters." If it was <a data-href="nihilism" class="internal-link">nihilism</a>, it would lead to indifference.</span>

##### Contemplation of emptiness is very gradual

<span class="paragraph">Contemplation of <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> is very gradual. I've never met anyone who it was sudden for, no matter what you might read or hear about. It's very, very gradual. Very, very gradual. It's a very difficult thing to understand, and we contemplate it bit by bit. And slowly, slowly we start to - it comes together for us, and it starts to deepen. There are many levels of the depth of what it means, and that's a slow journey, and one has to respect that. It's very gradual. We need to see it over and over. So on this <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, we're just touching on it in one particular way in the last week, but a few little ways. ==There are many <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of seeing</a> <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>. But the point of a practice like what we've introduced this week is that one sees it over and over. One does this over and over until, more and more, the coin drops.== It's not a sudden - [snaps fingers] "Ah, I've got it now!" [rubs hands] "I understand now! That's it!" The <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a> of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a>, of not seeing <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>, of seeing independently existing things and selves - extremely deep, _extremely_ deep. So part of it is intellectual <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>, but that also needs to come down into the heart at some point. It's both. ==And just to remember that <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> is one tool. It's a tool we pick up for <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">freedom from suffering</a>, for the release from <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. So <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is another. They're both tools. And there are times when they come together in one kind of flow.==</span>

##### Story: 9/11 was not "nothing happened"

<span class="paragraph">I remember being - I lived in Boston, and I was there when the September 11 attacks happened, and was actually - I think it was the night or the night after it happened, there was a big gathering in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">meditation centre</a>, and discussion, and a teacher was there, and this and that. And at some point, it came up, this thing about <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>, and someone sort of said, "Well, it's all empty, and really nothing happened." [laughter] But totally the inappropriate tool at the time, because for the person who said that, and for, actually, at that time, everyone in the room, _everyone_ in the room, they couldn't pick up that "nothing happened" in a way that <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> came out of it. ==Now, ultimately speaking, you _could_ say nothing happened that day. Nothing happened _really_. But unless we can pick that up and really see it that way, unless our <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> of <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> is so evolved that that really means something for us, in a way that it liberates <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, then you put down the <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> as a tool. Forget about it. It's just words. It's just cleverness. And you pick up the tool of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, and you relate in terms of beings <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> and my response to their suffering.== So it's one tool, and one has to see, when is it appropriate and when not?</span>

##### Somehow the very seeing of the emptiness of everything liberates more compassion

<span class="paragraph">One actually eventually _does_ see with this <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> business: <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, too, is empty. It doesn't exist inherently and independently. And as Jeanette was saying, <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is empty. <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> is empty. It's all empty. And somehow the very seeing of the <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> of that liberates more <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>. It liberates more <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> in some completely paradoxical - mystery, beautiful mystery of it - way.</span>

##### The bodhisattva can make such a huge aspiration because they're holding the compassion with the emptiness of it all

<span class="paragraph">How is it that a <a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a> can make such a huge aspiration and for such huge amounts of time? Because, in a way, they're holding the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> with the <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> of it all. It's all empty. I'm empty. The person, 'I' as the giver of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>.

At another level, I'm right there. That's what allows a <a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a> to be a <a data-href="bodhisattva" class="internal-link">bodhisattva</a>, is that the <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a> and the <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> are together.
