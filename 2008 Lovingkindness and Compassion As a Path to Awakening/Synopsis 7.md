| <span class="blockid">1-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Two central aspirations for a bodhisattva boundless compassion and understanding emptiness\|Two central aspirations for a bodhisattva: boundless compassion and understanding emptiness]]<br/><hr class="cell">In the tradition, in the Buddhist tradition, the Dharma traditions, there is the concept and the idea of the bodhisattva. And that's been actually around since the beginning. And about 500, between 500 and 1,000 years - my maths isn't very good, but _a while_ after the Buddha died ... [laughter] It gained quite a central significance and a slightly different meaning. And what it came to mean in the tradition was someone who aspired very highly with two central aspirations. And one was the aspiration of compassion, of boundless compassion, and serving life, serving other beings. And the other was - and sometimes this is, interestingly, neglected - to fully understand the emptiness of all things, of all phenomena. And those two together - so it's the compassion and the wisdom together - make up that aspiration to live that way, to fulfil both of those potentials, make up the bodhisattva. And actually it was originally meant as someone who vowed to become a Buddha in a future life. But this came about historically - and historians are a little bit unclear when exactly it emerged and how it emerged and where it emerged in the tradition. But it was felt among, obviously, certain practitioners that a while after the Buddha's death, there was not quite a full enough understanding of what the Buddha originally said - and so that's where the emptiness piece comes in - and also that somehow the emphasis on compassion had slipped a little bit, and a lot of people were practising just for themselves. So this rebirth of the emphasis on compassion and fullness of understanding on emptiness. |  |
| <span class="blockid">1-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#A Bodhisattva lives their life with compassion at the centre of their priority\|A Bodhisattva lives their life with compassion at the centre of their priority]]<br/><hr class="cell">So a bodhisattva is really someone who is totally devoted to compassion, who lives their life with compassion at the centre, at the core of their priority. Their whole life is kind of revolving around compassion, revolving around the wish, the desire, to serve others. There's a text by Śāntideva, I think eighth century, quite some years after the Buddha's death, and in a way, it's the epitome of the sort of expression of this aspiration. There are a few extracts from this I'd like to read. Has anyone read from this on this retreat - no, one of us teachers on this retreat? It's expressing this yearning, this wish, this surrender to the centrality of compassion, and the movement of compassion in one's life. |  |
| <span class="blockid">1-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Santideva expressing this yearning to surrender to the centrality of compassion\|Santideva expressing this yearning to surrender to the centrality of compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">> I am medicine for the sick and weary. May I be their physician and their nurse until disease appears no more.<br/>May I strike down the anguish of thirst and hunger with rains of food and drink. May I be food and drink to them in famine and disaster.<br/>May I be an inexhaustible treasure for those in need. May I be their servant to give them all they desire.</br>My body, my pleasure, my merit, now and forever, everywhere - I care nothing for them. I cast them aside to accomplish the aim of beings.... |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Maybe this aspiration doesn't necessarily need to take birth in a sudden way but can rather be a gradual movement\|Maybe this aspiration doesn't necessarily need to take birth in a sudden way, but can rather be a gradual movement]]<br/><hr class="cell">It's very, very powerful. Very beautiful passage. When Śāntideva, in the _Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra_ (that extract's from that) where he puts these ideas forth and this aspiration forth, the chapter before that, it comes, it bursts - he describes it _bursting_ into his consciousness as a kind of explosion of this aspiration for compassion, very sudden. But I wonder, you know, alongside - with the language being extremely ornate and extreme and colourful - I wonder if that's also an exaggeration, and if this aspiration towards compassion necessarily needs to take birth in a sudden way. You know, sudden equals dramatic, and people like that because it's like, "Ooh!" But I wonder if this movement towards making compassion central can actually be a gradual movement. Does it need to be sudden? Or both? |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#What allows this kind of compassion to arise and stay\|What allows this kind of compassion to arise and stay?]]<br/><hr class="cell">And the question I want to go into today is, what allows that kind of compassion, first of all to be there, to arise, but second of all to actually stay, to stay there? Compassion like that, a huge compassion, to have compassion be central in one's life, to have love and compassion be central, it needs - the compassion needs an unshakeability to it. Somehow in the compassion there needs to be a real sense of, yeah, unshakeability, that it will stand up in the face of whatever suffering and all suffering. So the bigger the compassion, in a way, the bigger the unshakeability it needs, the bigger the foundation. So this is really what I want to go into today. And this is where the fourth _brahmavihāra_, equanimity, comes in. How does that come into compassion, to allow the compassion to be stronger and more stable? |  |
| <span class="blockid">2-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Four brahmaviharas; mudita\|Four brahmaviharas; mudita]]<br/><hr class="cell">So, there are these four _brahmavihāras_: _mettā_, compassion, _muditā_ (joy, which Catherine talked about yesterday), and equanimity. And I'm sure Catherine said this, but just to say, _muditā_ oftentimes gets translated as 'sympathetic joy,' joy in the joy of others. But really it's something much broader than that. It's, you could say, spiritual joy, joy that doesn't depend on the ego. So joy that doesn't depend on me getting something, you telling me how wonderful I am, me getting anything. It's not about the ego. It's joy that's coming from an openness, being touched in life. | <span class="blockid">1-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Equanimity is the fourth of the brahmaviharas\|Equanimity is the fourth of the brahmaviharas]]<br/><hr class="cell">Okay, so today I want to talk about equanimity - it's the fourth of the brahmavihāras - and specifically I want to talk about equanimity and its relation to compassion (actually, maybe broaden it out if we have time). So as you know, there are these four brahmavihāras, four divine or sublime abidings, dwellings of the heart, and we've been working mostly on the loving-kindness (the mettā), the compassion (karuṇā). Catherine, I think - Monday, or one day - talked about joy, which is the third one. |
|  | <span class="blockid">1-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Mudita is usually translated as "sympathetic joy"\|Mudita is usually translated as "sympathetic joy"]]<br/><hr class="cell">And just a word about that: usually, that third brahmavihāra gets translated - the Pali word is muditā - usually it gets translated as 'sympathetic joy,' which has the meaning of, if someone is happy, if some good circumstance befalls someone, something happens in their life to make them happy, then instead of being jealous or indifferent, we are happy for their happiness. We're happy for them to be happy. And that's the usual way that muditā is translated, sympathetic joy. |
|  | <span class="blockid">1-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Mudita is a kind of joy that's not so based on the ego\|Mudita is a kind of joy that's not so based on the ego]]<br/><hr class="cell">I think that translation actually came from the commentaries, and in the Buddha's original discourses, I'm not sure that he used it that way. The meaning that I prefer is more something like 'spiritual joy,' which isn't a great word, I know, but what it really to me means is a joy, a happiness in life that's not dependent on the ego getting something, or being pumped up by something, or inflated, or feeling superior or whatever. So a joy in life that is not about the ego getting. And then, of course, as a sort of small piece of that, there will be sympathetic joy. When someone else is happy, I will be happy as well, as a piece of spiritual joy. But it would also include things like wonder at nature, like that kind of receptivity that I was talking about, like an openness to be touched by life, and touched by the beauty, the awe, the wonder of life, in a way that I can't own, I can't possess it; it has nothing to do with me. It has nothing to do with me being great, or giving me anything particularly. So some kind of joy that's not so based on the ego. That's the third one. |
| <span class="blockid">3-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Equanimity in its relationship to compassion\|Equanimity in its relationship to compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">And so, there's _muditā_, and there's this last _brahmavihāra_, equanimity, or _upekkhā_. Now, when the Buddha talked about equanimity, most of the time he meant equanimity in relation to all things and all conditions. So it wasn't just in relationship to the suffering of beings. So in a way, it has two meanings. One is a very broad meaning: just stable, steady, remaining open in the face of whatever happens, whatever conditions there are, whatever conditions arise. And then the almost like 'smaller' meaning, which is actually what I want to go into more today: equanimity in its relationship to compassion, the way that equanimity needs to be there at the base of compassion to make that compassion really, really unshakeable. | <span class="blockid">1-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Equanimity is not a word we use much in English\|Equanimity is not a word we use much in English]]<br/><hr class="cell">And then the fourth one is this word 'equanimity.' The Pali word is upekkhā. And this is a strange word. It's not a word we use much in English. And again, if you wandered down Newton Abbot high street and you asked people, you know, "How often do you feel equanimous?" or whatever, you'd probably get some puzzled looks! [laughter] It's not a very common word. And sometimes it can be hard to understand what it actually means. |
|  | <span class="blockid">1-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#The heart and mind stay steady through their contact with all things in life\|The heart and mind stay steady through their contact with all things in life]]<br/><hr class="cell">It's a kind of steadiness, a steadiness of the heart and the mind. And again, there are two kinds of meanings. One is in relation to all things, so the mind, the heart, the being, stays steady, stays balanced, stays kind of unshakeable through its contact with all things in life. So in relation to whatever comes, however difficult, however wonderful, the heart, the mind, stays steady, stays upright, stays balanced. And that's the broader meaning of equanimity, and the way that the Buddha more often used it. |
| <span class="blockid">3-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Sometimes we help and it gets better sometimes not and that's where equanimity needs to come in\|Sometimes we help and it gets better, sometimes not, and that's where equanimity needs to come in]]<br/><hr class="cell">So that, in our lives or in our practices, we give compassion to beings. Or we help beings - we work in service or whatever it is. We work to help others. And oftentimes that helps. What we do helps. It's a factor that helps. But sometimes we're wishing compassion, we're meditating, we're actively involved in helping, and it doesn't help. It's just, the person is still suffering or getting worse. So this is really where the equanimity needs to come in. | <span class="blockid">1-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Equanimity makes the compassion steady in the face of suffering\|Equanimity makes the compassion steady in the face of suffering]]<br/><hr class="cell">And again, I think through the commentaries, it has come to have a kind of second meaning in relationship to beings - so specifically as a kind of balancing factor in terms of compassion. Here we are cultivating compassion and opening the heart, sensitizing the heart to the suffering in the world, the suffering of others, and our own, and sometimes acting in the world to try and alleviate the suffering, to be of service, to be of help. And yet, what we often find is that the suffering of others is _not_ alleviated. It's not helped. There's still suffering for whatever reasons. Or there's just _too much_ suffering in the world. It's actually endless. It's impossible for me to end all the suffering in the world. Can the heart stay steady with that? Can the compassion stay steady, so that we're not keeled over, bowled over, closing down or feeling depressed by that? So in relationship to beings, this is what equanimity means. It's a hugely important factor in compassion. |
|  | <span class="blockid">2-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#This talk is about how equanimity feeds into the compassion practice\|This talk is about how equanimity feeds into the compassion practice]]<br/><hr class="cell">I want to just go into a little bit how that factor of equanimity feeds into the compassion practice, how we can develop it within the compassion practice, and then broaden it out. Some of it, we've already touched on, but I just want to draw it out once more. |
| <span class="blockid">3-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Recap balancing of receiving and giving\|Recap: balancing of receiving and giving]]<br/><hr class="cell">So, questions: how does that come into the practice? How do we bring that in, in a very deep way, to the compassion practice, this equanimity? This will be the last time I say this piece, on this retreat at least, if you can stand it one more time: this balance, balance in the practice that I talk about - when we talk about compassion in the meditation, there's the taking in, the empathy, the tuning into the suffering of another, letting the heart resonate, letting that sorrow resonate in the heart, the receiving of the suffering. And the balancing of that with the healing energy that goes out, the balm, that which soothes, that which helps. And feeling that energy on its way out, the balm, the healing, because it bathes oneself on the way out, and it's actually pleasant, and it's actually happy, even if it's just quietly happy, and it's actually nourishing. | <span class="blockid">2-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#1 Opening the heart to resonate with the suffering we see empathy\|(1) Opening the heart to resonate with the suffering we see (empathy)]]<br/><hr class="cell">The first aspect is (which I've said a couple of times at least) - in the compassion practice, it has two elements. One is this, what I would call 'empathy.' We are opening the heart to receive, to resonate with, to sympathize with the suffering that we see. So I see sorrow, and something in the heart trembles with that sorrow, it resonates with that sorrow. Somehow, I don't know - mystically, almost - sorrow that isn't ours, we witness it, and something happens in our heart. Our heart vibrates sympathetically with that. |
|  | <span class="blockid">2-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#2 Wanting to heal the suffering energy\|(2) Wanting to heal the suffering (energy)]]<br/><hr class="cell">That's only half of compassion. The other half is this energy, this intention that comes out of the being, so to speak, that goes out of the being, that wants to heal, wants to alleviate and soothe that suffering, wants to comfort it. In the practice, we can actually feel where the balance is in any one moment. So sometimes it will feel like we're very much in the 'feeling the sorrow' side, where very much there's quite some sadness, or grief, or just being moved. And sometimes it can be very lovely, and there's a sweetness to it, there's a beauty to it; the heart is open and touched. And sometimes it feels like the balance is more, we're just feeling in, tuning into that energy that's going out - the lovely quality of healing, of light, the balm, the comforting. |
| <span class="blockid">3-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Develop the skill to find the dynamic balance\|Develop the skill to find the dynamic balance]]<br/><hr class="cell">So this is really, really crucial. And as I said, the balance won't be a set point. It will be dynamic. It will be moving back and forth. But we can develop this skill where we're actually aware where the balance is at any point in time. Am I too long in the empathy side? Too long with the grief of it? Do I need to sit more in the other side, feeling the nourishment of it? There _will_ be grief. There will be. And it's a beautiful thing when the heart opens and there are tears at the suffering in the world, the huge amount of suffering in the world, or those that we know. And the heart resonates with that. And it's a beautiful, precious treasure of what it is to be human, to live in the fullness of our humanity, that we _will_ feel that, and we _will_ shed tears, and we _will_ feel that grief. | <span class="blockid">2-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#The outflow of compassion from us to others touches us and we feel healed\|The outflow of compassion from us to others touches us, and we feel healed]]<br/><hr class="cell">This is a balance that's always moving. It's always moving. So part of the practice is to be aware of, in any one moment, where the balance is. If we're tuning into that healing quality, what's going out, the comforting, the balm, it actually has a feeling of feeling pleasant, and of feeling quite healing. So in coming out of _our_ being, it's actually touching us on its way out to others. And we feel healed. And there's a kind of pleasantness in it. There's a kind of brightness in it. There's a kind of healing in it. And there's even a kind of sense of well-being, of happiness in it. |
|  | <span class="blockid">2-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#There can be a lot of grief in the compassion practice about the immensity and universality of suffering\|There can be a lot of grief in the compassion practice about the immensity and universality of suffering]]<br/><hr class="cell">So sometimes there are times, and periods, even, when there's a lot of grief. There's a lot of grief, almost, in the compassion practice. Something in the heart is opening, and it's almost like a veil - we're removing a veil, and the heart just comes in a very raw contact with the suffering of the world. We see, like a veil has been removed from the eyes, from the heart, and we're touching directly the suffering in the world. We see the immensity of it. We see the universality of it, the fact of death, the fact of change, the fact of disease, the fact of all of it. |
|  | <span class="blockid">2-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#It's part of our humanity to be touched\|It's part of our humanity to be touched]]<br/><hr class="cell">And the heart can, in that - there is a grief, and there can be tears and sorrow and a real being touched at a very deep level, which in a way is important. For some people, that will be there at times, and it's part of the heart opening. It's not everyone that goes through something like that, but it can be there at times, very subtly, or more strongly. And in a way, it's part of our humanity to be touched. We're not, in a way, wanting to be untouched and inhuman. It gives the heart a quality of some kind of opening, some kind of tenderness that's really important. |
| <span class="blockid">3-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#You can take the skill from the cushion into the personal life\|You can take the skill from the cushion into the personal life]]<br/><hr class="cell">But unless, in a long-term way, unless we get this, take care of this balance, the compassion won't have strength and sustainability to it. And that's what we're really talking about: sustainability. What gives compassion - just that it lasts, it can really last? It's really, really important. Now, I'm talking in terms of very specific nuts and bolts of technique with this. But the beautiful thing is it _translates_. Develop the skill on the cushion, in the meditation hall, of this balance, and it translates when you're sitting opposite someone, listening to them. You're holding their hand. You're with someone. You can actually take that same skill that came from the meditation practice and translate it into the personal, when you're talking, when you're listening, etc. It's just a skill. But this is really, really fundamental, and it gives the compassion a sense of buoyancy. So as I said, how common it is for people to do the compassion practice and then just feel sunk under it, _burdened_ by compassion. Often doesn't take very long. Come on a retreat like this, a couple of days, and it's like, "_Phew_! Can we move on to the next one?" So it gives it a buoyancy, a balance, a steadiness, and this unshakeable quality, all of which are factors of equanimity coming in. | <span class="blockid">3-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Equanimity means buoyancy not to sink underneath the weight of the suffering\|Equanimity means  buoyancy, not to sink underneath the weight of the suffering]]<br/><hr class="cell">But we need to really be conscious of this balance in our practice of compassion. And I would say that in order that compassion in our life is something sustainable - in other words, we really feel like we can practise compassion all day every day for the rest of our lives, and not feel tired, not feel overwhelmed, not feel burdened by the suffering in the world - we need to keep tuning into that loveliness of what's going out, the nourishing quality of what's going out, the happiness of it, and keep being touched by that and our selves nourished by that. That gives the compassion, in that moment and in our lives, in the being, a kind of strength and sustainability. That's very much part of what equanimity means - strength, sustainability. It also gives a steadiness, gives a balance, and this unshakeability, which is all part of what equanimity means. And gives the heart a kind of buoyancy so that we don't feel, as I said, burdened, overwhelmed, sinking underneath the weight of the suffering of the world. This is hugely important. So there's that balance. |
| <span class="blockid">4-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Samadhi as less distractedness is more steadiness in the mind\|Samadhi as less distractedness is more steadiness in the mind]]<br/><hr class="cell">And then - again, also to repeat something else I've said a few times - the _samādhi_. So I'm just harping on and on about _samādhi_. In its most fundamental sense, _samādhi_ as non-distractedness - or _less_ distractedness, put it that way - because, again, please remember it's a continuum, _samādhi_. And I can't remember if I said this the other day, but there's such a tendency to think, "Oh, I have it," "I don't have it, and if I don't have it, then I'm a failure," and the self-judge comes in. It's a continuum. But generally speaking, _less_ distractedness - there's actually more steadiness in the mind. You can actually see that. So it's a simple equation: less distractedness, more steadiness. And that steadiness begins to absorb into the being in all kinds of ways. So not to neglect the power of the _samādhi_. | <span class="blockid">3-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Don't underestimate the power of samadhi in the deepening of equanimity\|Don't underestimate the power of samadhi in the deepening of equanimity]]<br/><hr class="cell">The other, or one other, piece that's really important with equanimity is samādhi, going back to near the beginning of the retreat. Samādhi in one sense is a kind of non-distractedness, you could say. When the mind is distracted, what's really happening is it's toppling over, pulled out to reach things. It's pulled out towards this, or pulled out towards that, and that very distractedness is a non-balance, a non-steadiness of mind. So really not to underestimate the benefits and the power of samādhi in the deepening of equanimity - Samādhi in the mettā and the compassion practice, and samādhi generally. |
| <span class="blockid">4-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Don't neglect how much samadhi can come into the being and affect the cells\|Don't neglect how much samadhi can come into the being and affect the cells]]<br/><hr class="cell">And it's very common for people to say to me, "Well, it's better for me to practise where there are more disturbances and my _samādhi_ is actually worse, because that's more similar to what I live with outside. And therefore it will have a greater carry-over effect when I leave the retreat." Now, there's a certain amount of wisdom in that, but don't neglect how much the _samādhi_ can actually come into the being and affect the cells and the whole consciousness that way. | <span class="blockid">3-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Story last year's retreatant who didn't want to do samadhi pointing to the busyness of life\|Story: last year's retreatant who didn't want to do samadhi, pointing to the busyness of life]]<br/><hr class="cell">I remember last year, after, I think it was after about two weeks, and there was one retreatant who, very thoughtfully, I thought, he said to me in an interview, "I think I don't want so much samādhi. I feel like when I go out into the world and deal with compassion in the world, the fact is, I'm moving in life. I'm moving. There's busyness, there's distraction, there's all of that. There's basically not a lot of samādhi compared to …" He was getting in relatively deep states here. "It would be more relevant," he said, "to practise here the rest of the time in states of non-samādhi, you know, actually when I'm quite distracted." I didn't ask him how he was planning to distract himself, but … [laughter] Anyway. |
|  | <span class="blockid">3-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Samadhi allows any quality to sink into the cells\|Samadhi allows any quality to sink into the cells]]<br/><hr class="cell">And so this was quite thoughtful, but as I say, not to underestimate. There's something that happens with samādhi. It sort of allows any quality, whether it's insight, whether it's mettā, whether it's compassion, whatever it is, to kind of sink into the cells, and to be there, woven in almost to the fabric of our being. So what's more common is to _not_ have so much samādhi, think we've understood something, think we've developed a lot of compassion, and find that when we go out it's a bit shaky. |
|  | <span class="blockid">3-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#But it's also important to practice when the mind isn't that settled\|But it's also important to practice when the mind isn't that settled]]<br/><hr class="cell">So again, not to say there's a cut-off point, but just generally that we want to be not underestimating the power of the samādhi. Having said that, what he said was also important, because sometimes we _are_ very busy, very distracted, and it's important to practise, too, when we're busy and when the mind isn't that settled. So both are important. |
| <span class="blockid">4-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The body is steeped in something very nourishing and still a sense which is with you more and more\|The body is steeped in something very nourishing and still, a sense which is with you more and more]]<br/><hr class="cell">**Rob**: Because _samādhi_ is a very - there's a big _physical_ sense in _samādhi_. As you go deeper into _samādhi_, the body sense is more and more involved, and the sense of the body. And there's a sense that the body is being more and more steeped or bathed in something that's very, very nourishing and ultimately very, very still. And that literally becomes the more common way that the body feels in life. That openness, that lightness, that sense of strength and steadiness comes into the body, and then that sense is with you more and more of the time. |  |
| <span class="blockid">4-7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#As the samadhi deepens it brings with it joy\|As the samadhi deepens, it brings with it joy]]<br/><hr class="cell">We didn't really go much into _samādhi_ on this retreat, but just to say, there could be another retreat where we spent a month just on _samādhi_, or three months, or whatever it is. And as the _samādhi_ deepens, it actually brings with it joy. It goes through a whole range of territory where joy comes, and joy comes very fully into the being. And that joy, the _muditā_, is also a basis for equanimity. When we have joy, when we're familiar and have familiar access with a sense of joy in our life, we have enough. And then we're less shakeable in this life and in relationship to our suffering and the suffering of others. So the _samādhi_ naturally actually goes on a journey, long-term I'm talking about, naturally goes on a journey through joy and then naturally actually ripens into equanimity. | <span class="blockid">3-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#The natural progression of samadhi leads to equanimity which eventually becomes also accessible outside samadhi\|The natural progression of samadhi leads to equanimity, which eventually becomes also accessible outside samadhi]]<br/><hr class="cell">Generally, as samādhi deepens, as a general quality in the being, it actually leads to equanimity. It's part of the natural progression of samādhi - through physical pīti, what I talked about; through happiness; through peacefulness; to actually descend to depths of equanimity. And then, in the course of that - and this is usually a progression that takes months and months, but in the progression of that, the equanimity, too, gets kind of sewn into the being, and it's really something that's accessible in life, not just in the samādhi. |
| <span class="blockid">5-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The whole range of feeling compassion is important\|The whole range of feeling compassion is important]]<br/><hr class="cell">When we're doing the compassion practice, it's very common and very normal to have a sense of the self doing the compassion: here I am, sitting and walking and kind of flapping as much as I can and trying to generate some compassion. And that's very normal. It's very natural. The self is doing the compassion. And sometimes, _sometimes_ - and I'm sure some of you have tasted this to some degree or other - again, as the practice deepens, as the _samādhi_ deepens, there can be a sense that it's less the self doing it. There's just a sense of almost effortlessness, or less effort, less self behind it and more just compassion _present_. There seems to be less _doing_. Now, it can be common, if one gets a taste of that at times, to neglect kind of the doing of the compassion and to think, "Well, the really proper compassion is when I don't feel like I'm doing it, or when it doesn't feel to be much self in it." But the whole range is important. And this is really, really important to keep in mind. The whole range of compassion and how compassion feels is important to us. | <span class="blockid">4-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#How much is the self _doing_ the compassion practice\|How much is the self _doing_ the compassion practice]]<br/><hr class="cell">Okay, so there's this balance in the practice that I was talking about. There's the samādhi. There's also this factor about how much the self is _doing_ the compassion practice. So sometimes, especially from the beginning weeks, really, if you're on retreat, it can very much feel like I'm sort of pumping away at the phrases, and then sometimes there's a feeling of compassion, and then sometimes not. But it feels like the self is doing it, and the self is sort of trying to get this compassion to happen, and then feeling the compassion if it's there. |
|  | <span class="blockid">4-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#As the self-sense gets quite equanimity becomes the natural state\|As the self-sense gets quite, equanimity becomes the natural state]]<br/><hr class="cell">But some of you, I think, have noticed this - and again, not to make any kind of measurement out of this - but sometimes, as the sense of deepening happens in the practice, it can actually feel like it's not the self doing it. It's not _me_ making compassion. It's not me kind of pumping everything up with the phrases, and sort of making sure it's okay. It's more like compassion is just something there that we can tune into, and the self a little bit gets out of the way. It's not the self doing it. This is quite an important area, or shift, that can happen in practice, if it happens. Self and equanimity have a very, in a way, clear and interesting relationship. Basically, the more the self-sense, the bigger the self-sense, the stronger the self-sense, the less the equanimity. It's actually that simple. It's either one or the other. As the self-sense gets quiet, as the ego gets quiet, equanimity is the natural state. There's less self in there, invested and worrying about, "Will this work out? Will it not work out? How's it all going?", and equanimity is a natural settling, of when there's less self being built up. |
| <span class="blockid">5-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Doing is an aspect of compassion\|Doing is an aspect of compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">So sometimes, it _does_ feel like, "Here I am, flapping and huffing and puffing and trying to get the compassion going." There's very much the _self_, _this self_ giving compassion to _that self -_ very much about self and other, absolutely necessary and fine, and important. So this doing _is_ an aspect of compassion. Compassion wants to alleviate suffering, and there's a doing in that. There are also the other aspects of compassion, receiving and holding suffering, definitely. But there's also a doing involved. So, you know, if we are in the presence of a child that's starving, we don't say, you know, "I'm feeling really receptive. Tell me all about it. I'm all ears." [laughter] Silly, obviously. You _do_ something. You _act_. |  |
| <span class="blockid">5-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Sometimes with more doing there is more self and more attachment to the results\|Sometimes with more doing, there is more self and more attachment to the results]]<br/><hr class="cell">But this is delicate. Sometimes when we do more, or _feel_ we're doing more, actually, in the doing, the sense of self gets built up because it becomes the doer. The self becomes the doer, and with it, a sense of attachment to results. The more doing - not always, but oftentimes - the more doing, the more self and the more attachment to the results. And with that attachment to the results, the less equanimity in the compassion. Do you see that? |  |
| <span class="blockid">5-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Story flare-up of Crohn's disease\|Story: flare-up of Crohn's disease]]<br/><hr class="cell">I remember, five years ago or something, being on retreat here for three months and at some point getting ill (I can't remember when it was) at some point in the retreat. And getting ill with a flare-up of Crohn's disease, which is something I suffer from, from time to time. And this is a disease - some of you may know - where they haven't really figured out a cause for it. They don't really understand it. And so, my particular personality, what happens to _me_ when I get it is one part of my being tries to figure it out. And I start experimenting with diet and this alternative and that, and sort of taking notes, and ... [laughs] And I just, you know, it's just my personality. I can't help it. Well, I probably could. But anyway ... [laughter] What I noticed at that time was there were two modes: |  |
| <span class="blockid">5-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#1 mode just being with that\|1. mode: just being with that]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(1)** One, I was on retreat, which is a very 'nothing to do, nowhere to go' mode. And I could just sit with the discomfort of it and the pain of it and the fear, etc., and just hold all that in compassion and non-doing - just being with that, just letting that be held. And that was one mode, which was a very beautiful way of being with something very difficult. |  |
| <span class="blockid">5-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#2 mode trying to figure out what would bring healing\|2. mode: trying to figure out what would bring healing]]<br/><hr class="cell">**(2)** And then another mode was very much about doing and trying to take care of myself and trying to figure out what the best thing - what would bring healing. |  |
| <span class="blockid">5-7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Both modes are necessary\|Both modes are necessary]]<br/><hr class="cell">_Both_ are necessary. Just to watch - sometimes, what I noticed was the more that I got into the 'figuring out' mode, out of wanting to heal, oftentimes it felt the more removed I was from the kind of holding of the compassion and the sense of that, the sweetness of compassion, in a way. |  |
| <span class="blockid">6-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Acknowledge that with compassion there is a range\|Acknowledge that with compassion there is a range]]<br/><hr class="cell">_Both_ are necessary though. It's really important to acknowledge that with compassion, it really is a range, and _all_ of that is compassion. Even when it looks like one is just tearing one's hair out trying to figure something out or trying to help someone, it's still the expression of compassion - very much so. |  |
| <span class="blockid">6-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#A space of compassion\|A space of compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">Sometimes, as has been mentioned, the compassion practice can seem, at times, for some people, can seem as if it opens out or drops into a whole other sense. There really is a spectrum here. And it's almost like a space of compassion opens up, a space. And in that space, suffering is held, that whatever suffering arises is held in that space. It's a space of compassion. And it could feel like it's a space within us, or it could feel like it's a vast space (and we've touched on this before in this retreat), a space that's actually the size of the universe. It's infinite. | <span class="blockid">4-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#With spaciousness any suffering can be held effortlessly in that space\|With spaciousness, any suffering can be held effortlessly in that space]]<br/><hr class="cell">Sometimes, too, and some of you have reported this, as well: when there's less self doing it, there can sometimes feel like a spaciousness comes into the compassion practice. And again, it's not the self doing it, but it's almost like there is a space, like there is space in the universe, and that space is imbued, is kind of shot through with compassion. And that space, that space of compassion, holds any suffering that comes up in ourselves, in others, in an effortless way, through all time. So any suffering that was, any suffering that is now, any suffering that will be is just held, effortlessly, naturally, organically in that space. |
| <span class="blockid">6-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The more we encourage this spaciousness the more suffering can be effortlessly held in it\|The more we encourage this spaciousness, the more suffering can be effortlessly held in it]]<br/><hr class="cell">This is a very real perception that can arise for different people at different times. Spaciousness is also a quality, an _aspect_ of equanimity - very much so. When there's suffering, a spaciousness around that suffering is a colour, a face, of equanimity. In this practice, the more that we can actually encourage and dwell in that spaciousness, where whatever suffering there is or whatever suffering could possibly arise in the universe, it actually is effortlessly held. And we can begin to get glimpses of that experience and then actually nurture it. We can learn to nurture that experience as a very real perception that begins, again, in a very real way, to change our whole relationship with suffering in the world and in ourselves and in this life. That it moves more and more from 'little old me' who has to hold this suffering to a kind of - it's just held, and one knows it's held, and one feels it's held. And in that vastness of holding, there's equanimity with the compassion, mixed in with the compassion. | <span class="blockid">4-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Spaciousness is a prominent feature of equanimity\|Spaciousness is a prominent feature of equanimity]]<br/><hr class="cell">And this is a sense that can open up. It's not me, little old me, holding someone else's suffering. It's actually, whatever you want to say, the universe holding it, the space holding it, the vast heart holding it. Spaciousness, space, is also a really significant factor of equanimity. So we could talk about equanimity as being steadiness and balance, but it's also a kind of spaciousness. That's a very prominent feature of equanimity. |
| <span class="blockid">6-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#This can be very beautiful even mystical\|This can be very beautiful, even mystical]]<br/><hr class="cell">And sometimes, for some people, this can be a very - well, almost always is a very beautiful sense, even a mystical or a religious sense, and that's very much a part of it. The perceptions can change. They can open out. And something very beautiful is born there which we can then ... not _snatch_ at and not try to _keep_, but encourage, nurture, nourish that opening of the perception. And it's a gradual thing, but it's definitely possible. A lot of transformation comes from that. |  |
| <span class="blockid">6-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Rainer Maria Rilke "Autumn"\|Rainer Maria Rilke: "Autumn"]]<br/><hr class="cell">Someone wrote me a little note with a poem that she'd found from Rilke.^[Rainer Maria Rilke, "Autumn," tr. Jonathan Cott. Archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20201102174022/http://www.monadnockmama.com/poem-for-an-autumn-day] It's very lovely. It speaks to this sense of the holding being something almost religious, or simply religious. |  |
| <span class="blockid">6-7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#This can take on a very personal flavour\|This can take on a very personal flavour]]<br/><hr class="cell">Very beautiful, speaking about this holding, which for some people takes a very personal flavour. And in Tibetan traditions and other of the Buddhist traditions, very much the relationship with the bodhisattva, the relationship with the guru or the root guru, as someone one prays to, as someone who's actually holding, in the vastness of their consciousness, one's own suffering. And you get the same thing in mystical Christianity, that the cosmic Christ or the energy of Christ is actually holding the suffering in the universe. That could be personal, but it could also be impersonal - don't need to necessarily introduce any figure into it. And people are different, and they have different tendencies. This is a tendency that can open. It brings a lot of equanimity. One possibility. |  |
| <span class="blockid">6-8</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The aspiration of a bodhisattva is mind-blowingly high\|The aspiration of a bodhisattva is mind-blowingly high]]<br/><hr class="cell">When we speak, when we use the language of 'bodhisattva,' and especially when we hear Śāntideva and this kind of thing, it's an incredibly high aspiration. I mean, it's almost like mind-blowingly high, _almost_ unreal. When we hear it, it's almost - I mean, that's the flavour that comes off, is a kind of mind-boggling unreality to it. And yet there are people who take it on. It comes to become something real for them. It translates in a way that becomes something real. But whether we're moved by that or repelled by that, that's actually not what I want to so much dwell on. I want to go into, what allows _our_ compassion - wherever we are in that - to become unshakeable, or more and more unshakeable? |  |
| <span class="blockid">7-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#We have to respect where we are in our humanity\|We have to respect where we are in our humanity]]<br/><hr class="cell">So we can have a sense of 'bodhisattva' being a very high aspiration. We also need to respect: "Where are we? Where am I in all this? How is it for me right now, when I'm in a situation with someone that's suffering, someone I know or don't know or I care about? Where am I _really_ in my humanity?" And sometimes - you know, this is really something, I think, to give very careful attention to in our life - sometimes we neglect ourselves and our needs. Sometimes we're _too_ cautious perhaps. And perhaps there _is_ a place for stretching ourselves, stretching our limits, just saying, "To hell with myself and my self-concern," and just a kind of abandon. Maybe that has its place. Or rather, it definitely has its place, but it needs to be approached with wisdom. And stretching the limits of one's stamina and one's endurance in serving and in giving - there is the place for that. And I'm not necessarily talking about something, you know, like literally giving up one's life. I'm just talking about little ways. Just letting go of the self-concern. Sometimes - and you must have come across this - you're doing the _mettā_ or the compassion practice, and something's not feeling quite right for _you_. Either the body's niggling, or something's not right. It can be very skilful to just drop in, "It doesn't matter how I feel right now. It doesn't matter. I'm just giving the compassion to you." You can just play with this kind of abandonment of self-concern - not all the time, but just sometimes. | <span class="blockid">4-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Still the self giving compassion is a necessary aspect of our humanity\|Still, the self giving compassion is a necessary aspect of our humanity]]<br/><hr class="cell">Now, both of these - whether it's the self doing it, and it just feels like this being over here giving compassion to that being over there, or it feels like there's not really much self doing it; it's just compassion, it's just suffering being held in the space, just being held by a space of compassion - both are important and both are necessary. So it's not to feel like, "Oh, one's irrelevant after a while." This self giving compassion to that self is very human. It's part of our humanity, and it is a necessary aspect of our humanity, a necessary level, in a way, of compassion. |
| <span class="blockid">7-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#It can happen that we feel that our needs are not being met\|It can happen that we feel that our needs are not being met]]<br/><hr class="cell">But this is a very delicate area and needs a lot of careful attention. Sometimes we need to ask, "What are my needs, what are _my_ needs, in this situation? What are my desires too?" I'm sure many of you have had a situation, or have situations, where we are in a relationship or a friendship or a situation with someone where they are suffering. The other is suffering. And perhaps it's going on for quite a while. It's chronic. And we are in a caretaking role in some form or another. So maybe it's just a friendship. And sometimes, even in a friendship or relationship with a person who is bringing suffering on themselves, and you can see that because of the choices they're making towards, whatever it is, alcohol, drugs, the way they're living - you can just see, and yet you care about this person, and you want to live with compassion there. And one can very understandably, very naturally feel in that situation, "Here, in the ongoingness of this relationship, my needs are not being met." | <span class="blockid">4-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#"What do I want or need for myself here"\|"What do I want or need for myself here?"]]<br/><hr class="cell">So there's the balance, the samādhi, the busyness (or not) of the self, and the openness to space and spaciousness. And also something a little bit more complicated, or potentially more messy, which is: sometimes when we are involved in a relationship, any kind of relationship with someone, or involved in helping or compassion, something gets out of balance, and what's really happening is I am wanting or needing something from that person or from the situation. Sometimes it's clear, and sometimes it's a little more under the surface. So sometimes to ask oneself, "What do I want or need for myself here?" This can be quite complicated and messy and not clear, and it's not to say that we shouldn't have wants or needs either. |
| <span class="blockid">7-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#It's especially difficult if the person is bringing the suffering on for themselves\|It's especially difficult if the person is bringing the suffering on for themselves]]<br/><hr class="cell">And so this is, I think, very common when one finds oneself in this situation with a friend or any kind of relationship where this is going on in. And especially difficult when the person seems to be bringing it on for themselves, if you've ever been close with an addict or something like that. It's a very difficult relationship to keep and keep healthy. And the question, am I taking care of my needs in this situation? Am I taking care of my needs? Not easy. Because there will be in that - if there's friendship, and if there's a history of friendship and relationship - there will be loneliness that comes in. Sometimes it can feel like the person is just not available. Either they literally don't have the energy to be there, or they're just checked out. And there can be loneliness come in. We don't feel met. We don't feel seen. We don't feel like there's a flow of love and friendship there. We don't feel loved. | <span class="blockid">5-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#It's challenging to care for someone who is clearly causing suffering for themselves\|It's challenging to care for someone who is clearly causing suffering for themselves]]<br/><hr class="cell">If we're talking about compassion to a friend or a relationship, sometimes we feel when the other is suffering, when there is a lot of suffering in the other, we feel, and especially if it goes on for a long period of time, we feel that "My needs in the relationship are not being met. My needs in this relationship are not being met." Or we are involved in a relationship or a situation of care for someone who is clearly causing suffering for themselves in an ongoing way. They're maybe in some addiction or some destructive behaviour or whatever it is, and again, it can feel like, "My needs in this relationship are not being met." So this is quite a common scenario, and I know, in my past, I've certainly been involved in these kind of situations. Someone once said to me - I mean, it's strange language they used - but it's a very high level of care, to be in that situation in a healthy way, and caring for someone who's doing that, without having it be unhealthy - on both sides. |
|  | <span class="blockid">5-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Am I finding a way to care of my needs\|Am I finding a way to care of my needs?]]<br/><hr class="cell">Am I taking care of my needs, if that is the situation? So maybe I _do_ have genuine needs. And again, this goes back to a talk a while ago: we can talk about loving-kindness and compassion, and it can sound all very abstract and completely clean and pure, but the reality of our life is that we are involved in relationships, and we all have needs and wants within that. So am I taking care of my needs? Am I finding a way to do that? |
| <span class="blockid">7-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Codependency\|Codependency]]<br/><hr class="cell">So this is all really important stuff to be aware of. What are my needs? What's going on here? And what's it important to take care of? And it can also be complicated by other factors. Sometimes we're with someone who's suffering, and we actually, if we're honest, we look inside, we notice, or we may notice, we want to be needed. We want to be needed. And so, in a way, this is a very weird one. Something in us actually has an investment in keeping the other suffering because - and this is a horrible word, but in some psychotherapies they call it 'co-dependency.' It's actually a mutual investment in someone suffering and the other person kind of wanting to keep them down. | <span class="blockid">5-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Co-dependence can happen\|Co-dependence can happen]]<br/><hr class="cell">So it may be that we're in a situation where we actually end up feeling quite lonely. Or we feel like we need a friend. Or that, as I said, we're not being met, or we're not feeling loved. This is quite common. Sometimes it's a little bit even more complicated; we may be involved in a situation where we are actually invested somehow in being needed. So we're interested in compassion, but another sort of stratum in there is that a part of us actually wants to keep the person somewhat down so that we are needed. And again, this can come in in very insidious ways. Not, again, not to be scared of all this, because this is part of humanity, and it's part of being human. I think some psychotherapies call that co-dependence, that kind of - it's a whole system in place of, "You be messed up so that I can feel needed," and it's just something that human beings do sometimes. |
| <span class="blockid">8-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Is it possible to get what we need in a healthy way\|Is it possible to get what we need in a healthy way?]]<br/><hr class="cell">We have to ask, "Do I want to feel needed? Do I need to feel needed? What's going on there if I do? Do I want to be recognized for my efforts, for the efforts of service and care?" So these are not easy questions. And in a way, some of that is just human. When we give service, when we give, when we're compassionate, there is a part of us, a very natural human part that wants to be - wants our efforts to be recognized. So the question is, or a question is, is it possible to get what we need in a healthy way - in a _healthy_ way, that it's not coming into the relationship in an undercurrent, undercover way, that we're actually conscious and getting what we need in a healthy way? Not easy, not easy territory at all. | <span class="blockid">5-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#We might want some recognition for our efforts\|We might want some recognition for our efforts]]<br/><hr class="cell">Or we may be involved in service, in helping people or trying to help people, and we're actually wanting a sense of achievement. We want this person to get better so we can feel like, "Yeah, right, something happened, you know. I did something. I was helpful." And this is completely understandable and completely normal. Or we may be involved in - and again, totally normal, totally human - we want some recognition for our efforts. You know, we work really hard to help, in whatever field it is, and then just feel like, "Well, it's not really being seen," or being seen in the way that we want it to be seen. |
| <span class="blockid">8-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Do not neglect metta to oneself\|Do not neglect metta to oneself]]<br/><hr class="cell">And sometimes when there's compassion and love and a situation of service to someone, and we feel frustrated, and we feel it's difficult, and we feel aversion is creeping in, and we feel judgment is creeping in - especially if they are not handling it well, or causing it for themselves, making wrong choices - again, compassion, _mettā_ to oneself, not to neglect that. It can be so quick to rush in to give to the other. | <span class="blockid">5-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#So we need to ask ourselves in those situations how we can get at least some of what we need in a healthy way\|So we need to ask ourselves in those situations how we can get at least some of what we need in a healthy way]]<br/><hr class="cell">So all of that. And it's quite, you know, complex and messy, and very human. Can I take care of myself in a healthy way? Can I get at least _some_ of what I need in a healthy way? So some of this is not easy, but to begin asking that question in the situations. When we're involved in compassion and love, in a situation where it's difficult, where it feels like the person is difficult or there's aversion, there's judgement, there's irritability with them, or we're just frustrated, we're frustrated with the situation, with the stuckness of the situation, we're frustrated with this person, whatever - really, really skilful to turn the compassion on oneself. So again, we tend to assume, to go straight into, "Oh, I just need to inject more compassion towards them and clean it up that way." _We're_ suffering there, and to really notice that and touch that with compassion. And then sometimes our relationship to the situation, the person, and the flow of compassion in that situation begins to soften, the perception begins to soften, and we're able to work more easily. |
| <span class="blockid">8-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#What is it that helps the compassion to stay strong\|What is it that helps the compassion to stay strong?]]<br/><hr class="cell">Oftentimes, though, we don't have that same kind of self-interest. It's not a friend or a relative or a partner or whatever that we're working with. There isn't that self-interest. But still the question, what is it that allows, that helps, the compassion to stay strong, to stay steady, to stay tender? So when I say 'strength,' I really mean to stay open, that the heart stays open, and stays soft and tender. What allows that? Often in the world we do see - it's clear. We look at another, and we can see. We look at others, and we see they are, you could say - one way of putting it is they're causing suffering for themselves or others, and out of ignorance. They're just not seeing the consequences of their actions or their way of being. And it's clear, and we look and we see that. And this is partly why equanimity is - why I want to speak about it. It's so important. The equanimity needs to come in. |  |
| <span class="blockid">8-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The near enemy of equanimity is indifference sometimes couched in spiritual language\|The near enemy of equanimity is indifference, sometimes couched in spiritual language]]<br/><hr class="cell">Remember we talked about near enemies? And near enemies of loving-kindness and near enemies of compassion. A near enemy of equanimity - something that _looks_ like it but on closer inspection is really _not_ it - the near enemy of equanimity is indifference. It's just, the heart's actually shut down, cold, disinterested, disconnected, whereas equanimity is actually open. It's still tender. It's still soft. It's interested. It's present. So oftentimes, indifference can even be dressed up in spiritual language. But it's not equanimity. Spiritual language in different traditions, you know, we have the notion of karma. And how often people - the temptation is to hear, "They're suffering" - the attitude - "It's just their karma. It's their karma, and they need to go through it." That's an Eastern concept. Or in the West, it's, you know, "God's punishing them," or something. These are taking spiritual concepts and using them in immature understandings. Rather to ask, "What is my responsibility to suffering, with suffering?" This is a huge question: "What's my responsibility? What's my response-ability, my ability to respond? What is my response?" | <br/><hr class="cell"><span style="color:red">also</span> [[Equanimity in Compassion#Equanimity is not indifference\|Equanimity is not indifference]] |
| <span class="blockid">8-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Compassion needs wisdom and faith in it\|Compassion needs wisdom and faith in it]]<br/><hr class="cell">So compassion, and particularly compassion with equanimity in it, has two factors which I want to say a bit about and talk around for a little bit. Compassion needs to have wisdom in it, and it needs to have faith in it. I want to talk around this for a little bit; it needs to have wisdom and faith. And this is at all kinds of different levels. So at a very sort of, I don't know, is it mundane level, perhaps, one aspect of wisdom is just realizing the limits of our actions. So very easy to see this in the context of a political context, the limits, even in a democracy. You know, the tendency is to think, "What difference does it make if I vote or not?" Or certainly to see it very clearly with globalization. To realize the actual limits of one's actions and just to see: we are limited. Or even in other contexts, you have to see that here, one may be giving service or acting compassionately or trying to alleviate the suffering, and it's only one strand in a web of conditions. So what we do, what we choose to do, how we act and speak is just one strand in a web of conditions, in a web of interdependence. | <span class="blockid">6-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Politics show that there are limits in how much we can help\|Politics show that there are limits in how much we can help]]<br/><hr class="cell">You know, it's an immense task, I think, to take these brahmavihāras on in our life. And it's really a lifelong thing, to say "I'm really deeply interested, deeply committed to living a life, living in the world with love and compassion and joy," and somehow be steady through all of it. That's immense. And we do see that part of where the wisdom comes in is just realizing (and a lot of it is very clear) that there are limits to how much we can help, there are limits to our influence. So certainly we see this politically. In all political situations, all political structures, systems that I can think of, there's a real limit to the individual's, one individual's capacity to change. So we could see something like - well, all kinds of things that are going on now; just the limits of our influence politically. |

I can be doing all I can to help them, I may be the closest person to them, but it doesn't just depend on me. And so to begin to shift the seeing - this takes quite some time - to begin to see all the factors, all the conditions, the web of conditions that comes in to make any situation what it is. |

But one gives a talk, and one wants to help. One wants to offer something to help. And it's important, you know, for me to reflect, and I think for everyone who's doing this kind of thing, or any kind of act, to reflect that one gives a talk - there's so much going on. Like right now, there's so much going on making up this talk. It may seem to me or to you that _I'm_ giving the talk. Now, of course, at one level, I am. But actually, and if anyone has ever been involved in any kind of performing art, what you become aware of is, the talk is actually a collaboration. I'm actually doing most of the talking. [laughter] Although this group's interesting! [laughter] But anyway, it's actually a collaboration. So I still have this piece of paper and the notes and what I want to get through in the course of the talk. But there's something in the way everyone is present or not present, wakeful or not wakeful, interested or not, _everything_ - you know, if you ate too much for lunch, that's going to affect this talk. Thank you very much. [laughter] It's a totally collaborative effort. So what comes out of the mouth, the whole energy, the whole feel of it is actually a dependent arising. It's a web of conditions. | <span class="blockid">6-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Example Dharma talk\|Example: Dharma talk]]<br/><hr class="cell">So, for instance, a Dharma talk is quite an interesting example. It can seem as if I'm sitting here giving a Dharma talk, and you're listening. My experience is that's, you know, on one level, of course, that's what's happening. On another level, we're all giving this Dharma talk. It's a complete co-dependent arising. What's coming out of my mouth, the feeling in the room, the words I choose, the tone of voice, all of it is as much dependent on you and how you're feeling and what you're mirroring back to me, and this kind of interplay that's inextricable, as it is to what we all had for lunch in the day, and how tired I am, and everything is coming together. And I am quite tired! [laughter] Everything's coming together to make a Dharma talk. We tend to see it in terms of selves, and selves being responsible for things. It's a complete coming together. |

It's just one strand. And then the words come out, and _some_ of them are heard - let's be honest - _some_ of them are heard and some not. And its effects also, a whole - where's it landing? It's landing in a lot of different mind states. It's landing in a lot of different practice histories. It's landing in a lot of different life situations. And one will leave this talk, this retreat, and go out and meet a whole set of other conditions. So a talk, or a Dharma teaching, or whatever it is, an insight, is actually just a seed. And then it needs to meet a lot of other conditions. Now if I, in willing compassion, in giving, see myself as _too_ much of an instrument, or _too_ significant of an instrument, that's where my compassion is going to get too wobbly. It's not going to have that unshakeability to it. Have to see the web here, in this moment, and certainly in the future. | <span class="blockid">6-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Maybe it's just a seed\|Maybe it's just a seed]]<br/><hr class="cell">Then, I'll say, as a teacher, you know, you want to put something out there, and you want to say, "Well, I hope this changes people. I hope there's some transformation. I hope it makes a difference in people's lives." And that's a very earnest aspiration, desire. But as a teacher, I have to remind myself this is probably just one little drop, or one little seed, which will meet a whole web of other conditions later on. So it may be something happens. Maybe, you know, as I'm talking, someone says, "I've got it! That's it! Actually, I don't need to stay for the rest, Rob. I'll be having tea if you want me." [laughter] Maybe. That would be great. But mostly it's actually just a little drop, and then one goes out into that infinite web of conditions in the life. Maybe it's just a seed. It meets another condition, then it begins to sprout. Maybe it sprouts a little here, and then it gets watered. Maybe it meets the wrong conditions and it just gets covered over, you know? |

But if I think, "Right, by starting the talk at 7:30, by 8:30, everyone in this room needs to ..." [laughs] It's too much! Beings that we are helping, we need to remember, after this interaction, after this giving of the compassion, they go on, and they meet, they will meet, other conditions and other influences.

This is a hard one. All these brahmavihāras are difficult, but certainly equanimity is difficult. And equanimity, just to be really clear, is not a kind of detachment, coldness, greyness, disconnection. It's not indifference. Indifference is actually the near enemy of equanimity. So it can look like equanimity, look like, "Yeah, I'm fine. If you get healed, fine. If you suffer, that's fine," but actually, there's no real care there. So indifference is what _can_ look like equanimity, but it's not. And this is quite interesting, especially in spiritual circles, when a lot of stock gets put into non-attachment and peace and kind of, you know, being 'beyond' things, etc. |

Or in the West it's, "Oh, it's just God's will." I just can't really relate to that at all; to me, it's really not a useful way of thinking. Or rather, one has to _check_ if it's useful, in the sense that, is an attitude like that bringing indifference? So once I was meeting with someone who was not on retreat, and she was talking about reincarnation and past lives, and she said, "Is it right? Is it wrong?", and I said, you know, "I don't know." I asked her, "Is it actually opening your heart or not? Are you feeling more care coming from it? Are you feeling more commitment to kindness, to compassion?" And she said "Yes," so I said, "Great. If that's what's helping, then go for it." And the view might change later on, but the barometer is really: what's it doing to the heart? So what is my responsibility? Response-ability - my ability to respond. It's not karma or God's will as a sort of, you know, leading to indifference, and this is really important. |
| <span class="blockid">9-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Ripening of karma from the past\|Ripening of karma from the past]]<br/><hr class="cell">There are a few very interesting passages from the suttas, from the Buddha. I'm not quite sure where to put them in. I'll put them in here, in terms of conditions. He's talking about karma, and he's talking about the ripening of karma from the past. So this could be, we've done something that we regret, and then we feel the pain of that regret, that remorse or guilt. Or it could be that something bad has happened to us, and we have that memory. Something from the past is having its effect in the present: karma. He says something very interesting in a few different passages. When the mind, when the heart, is small, restricted, that karma ripens - the memory of what we did, or what happened to us or whatever - ripens in that context of the restricted, the constricted heart. In the unrestricted heart, the immeasurable heart - so one that is either immeasurable through loving-kindness and compassion, or joy or equanimity, one of the _brahmavihāras_, immeasurable that way, or unrestricted through _samādhi_ or through insight - in the unrestricted heart, when that karma ripens, when it comes up, when the memory comes up or the effects from the past come up, memory or otherwise, it's in a very different context. And the Buddha said it will barely be noticed. The pain from the past, the karma from the past will barely be noticed when the heart is really, really open like that. So this is a very powerful, very striking and powerful teaching. |  |

So it's a real - all this that I'm talking about is a continuum. Yeah, very important. So the smaller the heart, at any time, the karma comes up - extremely massive effect. The Buddha gives a few analogies - one of them is a salt crystal in a cup of water. How does the water taste after that? Pretty salty. Salt crystal in a huge lake, barely noticeable. And the Buddha says it will come up, but barely noticeable, barely making an impression when the heart is really ... So even when beings are suffering, there is the condition that they meet of what the heart is at any time in the future. Another analogy he gives is - and this just says something about the sort of judicial system of his time, but also at this time in different countries - that if you're a poor man, you can be thrown in jail for a long, long time, and no one cares, and you just get stuck in jail. But if you're a wealthy man, it doesn't happen. You don't get stuck in jail for a long time. You don't get thrown in jail. Not a very nice analogy, but the riches of the - again, what we're nurturing inside and the openness of the heart, the cultivation of this as a real wealth, _real_ wealth.^[The Buddha's words about the unrestricted, immeasurable heart, together with his analogies of the salt crystal and the poor man thrown in jail, are found at AN 3:101, _Loṇaphala Sutta_] |  |

I just remembered his story the other day because I remembered telling you about my trip to Auschwitz. And when I was there, I came across the story of Maximilian Kolbe - hope I remember it. He was a Polish man who became a Franciscan priest and monk ('Franciscan' is a denomination of Catholic monk and priest), I think in his early twenties, and lived in Poland and some time in Asia. And then the Nazis overtook Poland, and he was thrown in jail immediately just as a suspect, because of being a monk and a Catholic. And then released. |  |

And he hid them there, obviously under great danger to himself, great threat to himself. After a while, it was found out, and he and some of his colleagues were sent to Auschwitz, in the early part of the camp's existence. And after he'd been there a few months, just a couple of months, one day in his block, in his cell block, a prisoner went missing. And so the assumption on behalf of the Nazi guards was that this prisoner had escaped. It actually turned out that he had drowned in a latrine either by suicide or accident. But anyway, the assumption was that he had escaped, and the punishment if a person escaped from a cell block was that ten men were chosen at random and executed from that cell block. And so, ten were chosen from his block, and one of them, one of these ten, on being chosen - he was actually a Polish resistance fighter who was in Auschwitz. There were a lot of political prisoners in Auschwitz at the time. And one of them immediately broke down. He was picked as one of the ten. He immediately broke down: "How are my wife and children going to get on without me? You know, I've got young children. I've got a wife." And he immediately broke down. Didn't make any impact. |  |

And miraculously the commandant, the Nazi commandant, actually agreed to let this happen. So the punishment - this isn't very nice to hear, but the punishment was that they were thrown into a little room. I've actually seen the room. It's a tiny room, I thought. It was so tiny, I thought they must have died from asphyxiation, but actually they were left there to starve. And so just thrown into this little room at the bottom of the stairs and left there to starve. And usually people would last a few days before, basically, the body starts to decompose. After two weeks, the camp authorities needed to put more victims in the room, basically, so they went down to clear it out and found four of them still alive. Three of them were not conscious but still alive, and there was the last one still alive, which was actually Father Kolbe. And they killed - well, the camp executioner killed them with lethal injection. That's how they killed them. And he was completely conscious at the time of his death. |  |

There's another lovely ... Do you know who Damien the Leper is? Have you heard that? Just briefly, he was also actually a Catholic monk in the Dominican order. At one time, one of the Hawaiian Islands was a leper colony. So they would just use it to keep lepers. No one else lived there but lepers because of the fear of contagion. And he volunteered to be a minister to the lepers, to go and live out the rest of his life on this island with nothing but thousands and thousands of lepers. And he volunteered to do that. And he was a doctor, and he ministered to them, and he also was their religious minister. Eventually, I think it took twelve years, but he eventually contracted leprosy and eventually died. |  |

Faith is a very interesting quality. And again, there's a real spectrum to faith. So the beginnings of faith, and particularly if we talk about - we haven't talked much on this retreat about a sort of devotional faith, and too much about relationship with Kuan Yin and that kind of thing. Immature faith, or the beginnings of faith, the faith that "It will turn out how I want" - or we hear, "It will be all right," but what that really translates as, "It will turn out how I want." And that's the beginnings of faith, but it's actually an immature faith. |  |

And so it moves - it leaves behind 'what I can get,' 'what can I get,' 'what I am asking you for' - I am asking God or bodhisattva or Christ or whatever it is, what I'm asking for - it moves away from that. And someone said, not on this retreat, but just a week or so ago, I was meeting with them, and she said to me, "It feels like the gods have abandoned me."

As I said there's, again, this turning upside down of values, turning inside out: _thy_ will, not mine, be done. And so powerful and so beautiful. There's this movement into - as much as there's a movement of a path of wisdom into depth, there's a movement of path of devotion into depths. And people write about this. St John of the Cross is perhaps one of the most famous ones. Moving away from the kind of sense of consolation one gets from God or bodhisattva or whatever it is, away from that to _thy will_, and actually into the dark night of the soul, where one feels one isn't getting anything. There's something in that darkness, in that not getting. |  |

What must have been going on? Something happens in the deepening of faith and devotion. And this is what's perhaps important: the view of suffering changes. The view that we have of suffering changes. And in this case, it was through faith. So you can be - _I_ feel pretty sure that Father Kolbe was seeing that situation differently. There was something in the depth of his faith and devotion and sense of, in this case, sense of God, or whatever you want to call it, something that allowed him to see that situation differently, so that the suffering is not the whole of reality. This is very interesting. Or that suffering is not as real as it seems. Or that the suffering, again, is held in something else. It's held in something else. All of these are different views of suffering. They're different ways that the suffering is seen and related to. |  |

That's what brings - I think I said this in another talk - that's what brings security in life. There's a wisdom in seeing that, and there's a faith in it - faith in that, and also faith that it's possible for me. It's possible for me to cultivate - wherever I am now, whatever lack of beautiful qualities I seem to have when I look inside, however impoverished I feel - it's possible for me, it's possible for this being, this heart, this mind, to cultivate beautiful qualities and grow, let them grow.

This is at the root of any kind of Dharma understanding. But it's interesting, because different Dharma scenes are different, and this is a particular one, sort of typical Gaia House scene. But one could say, "Freedom from suffering is possible _generally_." In other words, it is possible, awakening is possible, freedom from suffering is possible in a very general, complete sense. And it's interesting how many practitioners and even long-term practitioners believe that. And I know people who have been practising decades and actually don't believe in the possibility of awakening or enlightenment. I'm not going to get into that now. |  |

Or it's possible to, at least in this instance, whatever it is, whatever's going on, less suffering is possible. A degree of freedom of suffering is possible. That's a real faith. That's a wisdom as well. And that's active. It does something. It means, here I am in a situation of suffering, and I know, I have faith that it's possible for me to suffer less, or another to suffer less. |  |

It brings an aliveness, an openness, an inquiry, a responsiveness. And this is really, really - in a way, it's such a small shift, but it's so significant. It's what transforms a moment of suffering into a moment of potential and practice. Otherwise, how are we viewing suffering? If none of this faith and wisdom is there, how are we actually viewing suffering, our own and others'? I think nowadays that we live in a non-religious culture, a very secular culture. How easy it is, without us even realizing it, to view suffering as meaningless, and in that, to be actually overwhelmed with suffering. Again, how are we seeing it? What's giving the view and the context to the suffering that we see? Very easy in the modern culture to view suffering as meaningless, pointless, nothing can come from it. |  |

And fundamentally, what that means is that we begin more and more, or more and more deeply, to understand the causes and conditions that give rise to suffering. That's what wisdom or insight or _paññā_ means: we're understanding the causes and conditions that lead to suffering. And out of that very understanding is born compassion. That very understanding will bring with it compassion. So one could never go anywhere near loving-kindness practice or compassion practice, and just the deepening of the insight will bring compassion naturally, effortlessly, organically, because we're going into the causes and conditions and _understanding_ that. |  |

Rather that it's not just a random thing that one has to just - either it doesn't have a meaning, or one just has to put up with, and one doesn't understand, and it's just there. So in the Dharma, in the strictly Dharma sense of faith, it's like, "I can understand something here that transforms it." So, just saying, it becomes a field of potential and a moment of potential. And other ways would be actually putting a different meaning on it which, for instance, someone like Father Kolbe might have. It doesn't matter. It's talking about changing views.

And the question for equanimity is: can the compassion stay steady and stay strong, but stay tender, that that tenderness of the heart remains? And sometimes it's very clear that we're seeing someone cause and perpetuate suffering for themselves through ignorance. They're caught in some pattern that they're not understanding - some addiction, some behaviour or whatever it is - and they're just perpetuating the suffering, causing suffering and keeping it going through ignorance. And that's hard to see. It's hard to be with. Especially when the compassion is there, it's hard to see. When there's love there, it's hard to see. |

And as I say, there's no blame here. It's seeing a commonality. It's really not about blame. But there is this sense that freedom is possible, at least to some extent, and so we're seeing the suffering differently. | <span class="blockid">8-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#This formal equanimity practice brings in the recollection to balance the compassion\|This formal equanimity practice brings in the recollection to balance the compassion]]<br/><hr class="cell">So to me, even just reading it, it's quite sobering, you know, to a heart - when there's compassion, it's quite sobering actually realizing the limits.

| <span class="blockid">14-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#And yet living with love and compassion is the best way to live\|And yet, living with love and compassion is the best way to live]]<br/><hr class="cell">As beings interested in compassion, interested in the openness of the heart, and living in the world, we find ourself touched by, confronted by, the enormity of suffering in the world. It's just there. And we see that, and hopefully we're open to that. And we want to be open to that. And we recognize the limits of what _I can do_, the limits of my actions, as I talked about earlier. And also, oftentimes, we look at the world and the situation in the world globally, politically, environmentally, and how little change often seems to be happening. And sometimes there are huge, massive changes that humanity has brought about. But oftentimes, we look, and there's very little change that seems to be happening. And yet, we might have that awareness - "Not much is happening here. There's an overwhelming amount of suffering" - yet living with love and compassion is the best way to live. It's the best way. So we can say, "What's the point? It doesn't make any difference. It's not going to make any difference." It's the best way to live, even when we're very conscious of the limits and the seeming pointlessness of it, out there. | <span class="blockid">8-3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Still loving-kindness and compassion is the best way to live even if actions or results seem to fall short\|Still, loving-kindness and compassion is the best way to live, even if actions or results seem to fall short]]<br/><hr class="cell">And so, we _do_ live in a world where, as I said, there are limits to our care. There are limits to the effects of our actions that we can see, certainly, and limits to what we can do. And so we see, and if you're involved in service, you are involved in situations where one's trying everything one can, one puts everything that one can in, and there's still suffering, there's still the situation. But, and I think John said this in the opening talk, loving-kindness and compassion, best way to live. The best way to live. So even if the action, even if the results, are not what we want them to do, the heart of loving-kindness and compassion is the best way to be in the world. And that heart balanced with a sense of freedom, balanced with a sense of equanimity. So this balance is not a tightrope. It's not a kind of razor's edge that we're walking. That's quite important. To me, it's more a sense of a softening, a spaciousness. So it's not something very tense, to keep on this balance of freedom and compassion. There's a kind of softening that can happen as the wisdom deepens, as the equanimity deepens, also as the compassion deepens. And a spaciousness that comes with that. |

You know, there was a relative amount of fuss, certain administrations, etc., Bush, and - "Oh, the science is still uncertain. It's not clear.

But I felt, even when the science was uncertain, it's like, well, even if we don't know, or even now, if it's too late, what's the best way to live? What's the best way to live? To choose the acts that are actually difficult, that go out of our way, that maybe involve some renunciation. What's getting fed in that? So maybe it makes a difference, maybe it doesn't. Maybe it's wrong science. Maybe it doesn't. What's getting fed if I just go with the "Maybe it doesn't matter. I'll just carry on as usual"? Maybe just this individual is not going to make a difference, but what's getting fed in this heart and the heart of others when I choose to renounce or whatever it is, or go without, or live differently because it _might_ make a difference? What's getting fed? Maybe that's _more_ important, or _as_ important, a question as whether the civilization survives as we know it. What's getting fed? |  |

Sometimes with this compassion and equanimity, we can feel as if we're walking a tightrope, and somehow we have to find this middle point. But actually, I think it's rather that a softening comes into the whole thing, a softening of the way one is seeing suffering and suffering that can't get resolved. Like, the whole view of it becomes softer and, again, more spacious. What is it that allows that softening? More than anything else, it's the understanding of emptiness. It's the opening to emptiness. It softens our view. And I would say, the more one goes into emptiness, and the more one contemplates emptiness and understands it, the more devotion comes into the being. And I mean that in a very broad sense. We're actually more and more then devoted to suffering. We can devote ourselves to that in a way that's not attached. So emptiness is not something that's dry or cold. It's certainly not nihilistic. It doesn't mean nothing exists, and it's just, "Meh, nothing matters." If it was nihilism, it would lead to indifference. | <span class="blockid">8-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#The more we see the emptiness of all things the more we can walk in a relaxed and effortless way\|The more we see the emptiness of all things, the more we can walk in a relaxed and effortless way]]<br/><hr class="cell">So the more we see into the emptiness of self and the emptiness of all things, the more that kind of spaciousness and that kind of softness can come in, and we're able to walk this tightrope (which really isn't a tightrope), we're able to walk that in a much more relaxed and effortless way. I would still say that's very difficult, but the movement is towards a kind of softening. |

Another sense that comes out is some kind of sense of devotion, I would call it. I don't really know another word for it - devotion. And that can take all kinds of forms. A heart that has opened, or is opening to emptiness, there's a kind of devotion to the world, at one level, that just comes in. So paradoxically, we see the emptiness of self, the emptiness of beings, the emptiness of the world, and we're even more devoted to it somehow, even more devoted. And that devotion has a quality of not being so attached to the result. There's a real softness in it. There's a softening in it. So seeing into emptiness is not a kind of nihilism. I think I said this the other day as well. It's a strange translation, but 'emptiness,' it can kind of make you feel like, "Well, there's nothing. There are no people. There's nothing. Nothing matters." But to go into what's called the extreme view of nihilism would give rise to indifference, which would be the near enemy of compassion. It's a kind of disconnection - disconnect, not caring, disinterested, aloof. |
|  | <span class="blockid">8-6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#I can neither find myself nor others deparate and in that the love is there\|I can neither find myself nor others deparate, and in that the love is there]]<br/><hr class="cell">So as we talked about in the compassion and the mettā practice, the more we actually contemplate this anattā in the different ways, the more we actually find it's opening up love, it's opening up a sense of connection. It should be, if we're sort of on the right track with it. And we talked about doing that with contemplating just mind moments, ownerless mind moments, not really anyone owning these mind moments of suffering. And the different ways, and we talked about anattā, and also talked about this sense of emptiness being fullness, being non-separation, so that I cannot actually find a separate being. It seems the most obvious thing in the world: here we are, a room full of whatever it is, numbers of beings, but as I look deeper and I go into it, I cannot actually find separate beings. Cannot find myself separate, cannot find others separate. And in that, the love is there. So there's that emptiness of selves - my self and other selves - and that brings the compassion, it brings the equanimity. And at a whole other level, there's even the emptiness of suffering. You can say, "Okay, well there are no beings, _really_," but even suffering, too, as you go really deep into it, that's also empty. And yet, paradoxically, seeing that brings compassion in a way that there's equanimity for it. |
| <span class="blockid">15-2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Contemplation of emptiness is very gradual\|Contemplation of emptiness is very gradual]]<br/><hr class="cell">Contemplation of emptiness is very gradual. I've never met anyone who it was sudden for, no matter what you might read or hear about. It's very, very gradual. Very, very gradual. It's a very difficult thing to understand, and we contemplate it bit by bit. And slowly, slowly we start to - it comes together for us, and it starts to deepen. There are many levels of the depth of what it means, and that's a slow journey, and one has to respect that. It's very gradual. We need to see it over and over. So on this retreat, we're just touching on it in one particular way in the last week, but a few little ways. There are many ways of seeing emptiness. But the point of a practice like what we've introduced this week is that one sees it over and over. One does this over and over until, more and more, the coin drops. It's not a sudden - [snaps fingers] "Ah, I've got it now!" [rubs hands] "I understand now! That's it!" The habit of delusion, of not seeing emptiness, of seeing independently existing things and selves - extremely deep, _extremely_ deep. So part of it is intellectual understanding, but that also needs to come down into the heart at some point. It's both. And just to remember that emptiness is one tool. It's a tool we pick up for freedom from suffering, for the release from suffering. So compassion is another. They're both tools. And there are times when they come together in one kind of flow. |  |

And at some point, it came up, this thing about emptiness, and someone sort of said, "Well, it's all empty, and really nothing happened." [laughter] But totally the inappropriate tool at the time, because for the person who said that, and for, actually, at that time, everyone in the room, _everyone_ in the room, they couldn't pick up that "nothing happened" in a way that compassion came out of it. Now, ultimately speaking, you _could_ say nothing happened that day. Nothing happened _really_. But unless we can pick that up and really see it that way, unless our understanding of emptiness is so evolved that that really means something for us, in a way that it liberates compassion, then you put down the emptiness as a tool. Forget about it. It's just words. It's just cleverness. And you pick up the tool of compassion, and you relate in terms of beings suffering and my response to their suffering. So it's one tool, and one has to see, when is it appropriate and when not? |  |

Because, in a way, they're holding the compassion with the emptiness of it all. It's all empty. I'm empty. The person, 'I' as the giver of compassion. The suffering is empty. The beings suffering are empty. It's all empty. At one level, nothing happened. At another level, I'm right there. That's what allows a bodhisattva to be a bodhisattva, is that the emptiness and the compassion are together. Without that, forget about it. I mean, it's just a monstrous thought. |  |

So at the beginning of the talk, I said that the most usual way the Buddha talked about equanimity was not so much in relation to beings, but in relation to all conditions, all things. So the mind, the heart, the being staying steady, staying balanced, unshakeable, whatever happens, whatever's going on, whatever is coming to the senses. Sometimes to ask ourselves: how much does my mind state depend on what's going on? This happens or that happens; how much does the mind state wobble with that? A steadiness with it is what equanimity is. All conditions, absolutely all conditions. |

So all conditions he's talking about, but there are eight in particular that he said, "These ones, pay particular attention to." They're four pairs: praise and blame, success and failure, gain and loss, and pleasure and pain. So four pairs. One pole of each pair we like. We like praise, success, gain, and pleasure. And the other pole we don't like, we don't want it. No one wants to be blamed or to be in pain or to fail or to lose what we like. And whoever we are in this life, whatever our history, whoever we are, whatever our credentials, we are going to be subject throughout our life to the wavering of those four polarities - no matter who you are. The Buddha certainly, Jesus certainly, Gandhi certainly, Mother Teresa, David Beckham [laughter], whoever. They're inescapable facts of life, the eight worldly conditions. To be in the world means to be subject to the movement along those four polarities. How steady can the heart be with that? |

And certainly there's a great power in contemplating impermanence. But I was talking a few weeks ago with another teacher, and she was saying whenever she starts giving a talk on impermanence, she notices people just sort of, "Impermanence, right," and this kind of screen goes up: "God, I've heard it before," which is understandable, because Buddhists just, you know, yap on about it. [laughter] |

Impermanence is extremely obvious. A five-year-old can agree that everything is impermanent - well, some pretty low age [laughter] can agree that everything's pretty impermanent. It's very clear to us. The question from the Dharma perspective is: are we seeing, are we contemplating impermanence in a way that's actually bringing a sense of freedom, bringing a sense of equanimity? And if we're choosing impermanence as an avenue of contemplation, finding a way of doing it that brings that. Because sometimes people are contemplating impermanence, and "Yeah, it's change, change, change"; there's no freedom coming out of it. So to find ways, and to talk with teachers and friends and whatever, and to find ways of working with impermanence, actually bringing, in the moment, a sense of freedom. In the moment, one feels as one's contemplating it, "Ah, oh, yeah, release, release." I think I touched on impermanence in one of the other talks, and I'm actually not going to go into that right now. |

The natural progress of samādhi, as it gets deeper and deeper - and I'm talking about really quite deep states of samādhi now - naturally move into equanimity. Naturally and organically, equanimity is a state of deep samādhi. How does it deepen? How does equanimity deepen? It actually deepens by letting go of grasping and craving. So the more, in the moment, we let go of grasping - of craving after something or trying to get rid of something - the more the being moves into equanimity. It's actually that simple. |

So it has a certain feeling-tone, equanimity, to it, a certain peacefulness, a certain stillness, and it's the mind kind of tuning into that wavelength, that resonance, and just being there with it, noticing it, feeling it, opening to it, and enjoying it, enjoying it, that allows it to deepen, to settle in the being. |

For a lot of people, it's really an acquired taste - deep calmness, deep stillness, deep equanimity. It's really an acquired taste, because generally our sense of _oomph_ in life, and _va-va-voom,_ and you know, things we get excited about, are generally _not_ in places of equanimity. They're in places of the self getting really excited about something, either something that we take as good or something that we take as dreadful, so some big drama we're caught in. And to steady and let the self kind of get quiet, and just stillness, and just stillness, and just equanimity - that can be, for many, many people, as I say, it's an acquired taste. |

I don't have time to go into this today, but joy, you know, whatever word you want - well-being, joy, deep nourishment, happiness, whatever word - that forms a basis for the being being able to really open to equanimity. Certainly in the samādhi it's also a basis, but in one's life, when there is more a sense of joy in one's life, we are less dependent on the external circumstances being this way or that way. It makes less of an impact, because we feel like we have enough. And this is a very gradual journey for most people, and a very non-linear journey. But looking into: how is it that my well of joy, my reservoir of inner happiness, can be deepened in life? And so looking into: how does the being open to wonder? How does it open to the mystery of life, to the awe of things? What's the place of art and music in that? What's the place of our relationship with nature? All of that. Certainly the mettā and the compassion practice build those reservoirs over time, build the inner reservoirs of happiness. |

Will this situation get better? Will this person get better? Will this inner situation get better? This emotion, will it ever go away? What's happening with my body, will it ever go away?" We're caught up in future thinking. And so, for instance, something like climate change, how much of what's going on with that and the way that we as a species are (_if_ we are) addressing it, how much of that is actually caught up in the future thinking. The scenarios on the front page of the newspaper: what will it be like in 2056? It's a lot of future thinking, which is fine. There's a real skill in future thinking. So again, in Dharma practice as well, what will my life be like if I don't take care of the kind of intentions I have in life, of the kind of actions, of the kind of speech, of cultivating what is beautiful? How will I be in twenty, thirty years if I'm still alive? What will have happened to the heart? And you can see this in other people, over decades. I shouldn't say this, but one just sees in other people - they've been cultivating or not certain qualities, and as they get older, one sees the being. |

Where is how I'm living, what I'm choosing, where is it leading me in my heart? But sometimes future thinking is actually not that skilful, and it can be quite skilful to drop it, to just drop future thinking. Not compound a situation, build up a sense of problem, by kind of tacking on the future to it. So here's this difficult situation internally or externally, and I'm just kind of imagining it going on forever, or "When will it end?" Do you see what I mean? You're building a solidity to it by time concept. And this goes on without us even realizing it. |

There's just this moment." Experientially, existentially, that's all there can be. There's just this moment. And in this moment, all there can be is an impression in awareness, experientially. So I'm not saying anything about "there is a world or there isn't a world," but from a sort of meditator's contemplative perspective, all there is now is this impression in awareness, whatever sense it comes through. |

All my house can ever be is an impression in awareness in the moment. All my anything can be is an impression in awareness in the moment. We get so caught up in a sense of solidifying things in a way that experientially they're actually _not_. Now, of course that view has its limits, but as a skilful means in meditation, it's actually very skilful. Really practising that, the whole sense of life can shift, over time - this whole sense of life being not as substantial as we tend to take it. This is another kind of approach to emptiness. It's quite a popular approach, actually: just seeing things as impressions in awareness in the moment. |
|  | <span class="blockid">11-4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Practice seeing things as just perceptions\|Practice: seeing things as just perceptions]]<br/><hr class="cell">A slightly more sophisticated approach is seeing things as just perceptions. They're perceptions that are built, that are fabricated. So this practice that we've been doing this week, with directing kindness towards things, and sometimes the things fade - one actually sees that, through the lack of kindness or the lack of acceptance, a perception is actually getting built, it's getting fabricated or compounded, to use the Buddha's words, constructed in the moment. Without the mind doing something, that perception cannot be there. So something, whatever's going on, is just a perception. It's just fabricated. It's empty, in other words. It's empty. |
|  | <span class="blockid">11-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Less push and pull means more equanimity and a fading of experience\|Less push and pull means more equanimity and a fading of experience]]<br/><hr class="cell">So through our practice and through our life, when we begin to stop elevating certain things and putting down other things - whatever they are, inner experiences, or outer things, or other people, or situations or whatever - when that movement gets less, when there is less pushing away of what we don't like and trying to keep or pull towards us what we do like, when that push and pull gets quieter (and it goes through a whole range of getting quieter, very, very subtle), this is the movement into equanimity. And similar to the practice that we're doing now, there can be, as the push and the pull gets quieter, there can be a kind of fading of experience. Things just get quieter. They make less of an impression in consciousness. They just begin to dissolve a little bit. |
|  | <span class="blockid">12-1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#Sometimes the experiences can dissolve completely\|Sometimes the experiences can dissolve completely]]<br/><hr class="cell">Sometimes they can dissolve completely. There's virtually nothing left. Sometimes there's just a little dissolving. Sometimes it's almost like the world has become a very soft, gentle flickering of sensation in a very quiet and spacious and relaxed way, and that's all that remains of the world. It's just a little burst here and a little burst there, of something that's almost nothing. That's a very deep level of equanimity. |

So used to think, used to define equanimity as being a steadiness in relation to what's difficult or what's great, or what's exciting or whatever, and the heart just stays steady. As the equanimity really deepens, not much really arises anyway. There's nothing really happening. So I can't really be equanimous in relation to what's difficult, because there's nothing there to be equanimous in relation _to_. It's gone. It's taken a whole different level of meaning. |

So again, sometimes we hear this word, 'equanimity,' and it's a strange word, as I said, and it can sound kind of cold and dry and grey or whatever. But to people committed to practice and open to that kind of thing, there really is a wonder in it and a beauty in it. There's a juiciness in it. I don't know any other word. It's not dry. It's absolutely not dry, and there's also love in it. There's absolutely love in it. In that state, there's a kind of non-separation. We're not building a sense of self and other, a sense of separation, by getting involved in this tussle, in this push and pull. In the non-separation, there's love, effortlessly. |

Sometimes, you know, describing kinds of experiences or states - it's not to snatch at the experience. What's much more important is the understanding. So sometimes there's an experience, sometimes there isn't; the more important thing is the understanding. And the understanding there is that, again, similar to the practice that we've been doing this week, how a thing appears depends on my relationship to it. Whether it appears at all depends on my relationship to it. How a thing is, then, depends on the push and the pull, and is inherently immeasurable. There is no _real_ way it is. It's immeasurable. |
|  | <span class="blockid">12-5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Equanimity in Compassion#The true nature of all things is immeasurable\|The true nature of all things is immeasurable]]<br/><hr class="cell">So this is more important than a certain kind of experience. We're actually beginning to see into, in a very deep level, the immeasurability of all things. All things, so-called 'inner,' so-called 'outer,' their true nature is immeasurable. And that understanding begins to go deep in the being, and we really begin to understand that in an unshakeable way, and it's that understanding that brings the deepest equanimity. Because then whatever happens, we know that it's not real in its own right. It's actually immeasurable. And that brings a really deep equanimity, and also a really deep love, a really deep compassion. Because we see the universality of it all. That principle is something that applies to all consciousnesses - not even just human beings; all consciousnesses. Whenever there's a consciousness, the appearance of things to that consciousness depends on the push and the pull, the relationship with. And that's universal. That universality, seeing that, understanding that, brings equanimity, as I said, but brings very deep compassion, because it's got very deep wisdom with it. |
