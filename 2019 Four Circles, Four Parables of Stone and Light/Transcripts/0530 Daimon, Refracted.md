[[Daimon, Refracted]]

###### 1-1
If one's practice and [[Insight|understanding]] of [[emptiness]], or _śūnyatā_, goes deep enough and wide enough, radical and thorough enough, then we see - amongst other things, we see that any view or [[The Self|sense of self]] is empty. Any self-concept is empty of inherent existence. It is not an ultimate or basic truth. So in that fuller and more radical [[Insight|understanding]] of [[emptiness]], it is _not_ the case, for example, that the personality is somehow illusory but what's _really_ the case or what really constitutes [[the self]] is just the process in time of the [[Skandhas|five aggregates]], of physical [[Materialism|materiality]], the [[Embodiment|body]], and [[feelings]], [[Perception|perceptions]], thoughts, intentions, [[consciousness]], etc. It's not the case, either, if one goes that deeply into [[emptiness]], that self is an illusion but some kind of [[oneness]] is a basic reality, etc. All these views, all views of self are seen to be empty. And where that leaves a practitioner who has seen that, who has understood that, is not, rather, with a sort of impossibility of using the language of self, or using the views of self, and a sort of "nowhere to go" situation in their life, predicament in their life regarding self (and anything else, in fact, because everything is empty), but rather, because _everything_ is empty, and there is no sort of hidden, basic, building block reality or fundament that is not empty, where it leaves a person, seeing that, is it opens up any and all views of self as kind of legitimate views and concepts to play with, to entertain, to put on the way an actor would put on different costumes, etc. - although that analogy quickly breaks down if you think about it[[Daimon, Refracted#All views of the self are empty which legitimizes playing with them|.]] ^1-1
###### 1-2
So through deep [[insight]], there's the legitimization to see and conceive and perceive self in different ways at different times in the whole range of views of self. So yes, sure, I can practise at times seeing or conceiving of personality being empty, ego being empty, but all there is is this process of the [[Skandhas|aggregates]] in time, for instance. Yes, fine. Legitimate view. Very helpful, quite freeing, quite simplifying at times, to a certain level helpful. Or a view of just cosmic [[oneness]] of one kind or another, and again the ego or the separate self is an illusion. Yes, beautiful, lovely, liberating to a certain extent at times, etc. And many others. But it also legitimizes seeing/sensing oneself as [[Daimon|angel]], or [[the self]] of another as [[Daimon|angel]], as [[Divinity|theophany]], as having a [[duty]] to one's [[Daimon|daimons]] (which we can actually use interchangeably with '[[Daimon|angel]],' for now at least)[[Daimon, Refracted#Possibilities self as process oneness angel|.]] ^1-2
###### 1-3
So the deep [[emptiness]] seeing, the radicality, the thoroughness, the totality of that legitimizes, opens up all kinds of possibilities - in a way, an infinite range of possibilities - rather than closing down all these possibilities. We're free, free to conceive and perceive and talk and entertain senses, any [[The Self|sense of self]]. We're free, free to move in that whole range, knowing all the time that whichever costume one puts on, whichever way of conceiving, sensing, viewing [[the self]] is empty, as empty as any other. And we said already in one of the talks - I can't remember already, but one of the talks in this series^[Rob Burbea, "'Until All is Liquid' (Emptiness and Sensing with Soul)" (29 May 2019), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/58786] - that when we talk about not just the [[Middle Way]] of [[emptiness]] in the [[Dharma]], what [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] calls the [[Middle Way]], and others, has come down the tradition as the sort of secondary meaning of [[Middle Way]], of the [[Buddha]]'s [[Middle Way]] - but when we talk about the _[[imaginal]]_ [[Middle Way]], we're not talking about simply a dissolution, a melting of [[the self]], a dissolving, a disappearing, a [[Emptiness|fading]] of self or other objects of the imagination. To be an object of the imagination, it must be formed in some way. It must retain some degree of form, this form or that form. And again, there's [[Infinity|the infinite]] range there[[Daimon, Refracted#We are free to entertain any sense of self|.]] ^1-3
###### 2-1
So [[imaginal]] [[Middle Way]], it's formed, but it's theatre. And again, as I said in the past, if you've been to good theatre, it's powerful. You know this is not real, what's happening in front of you, but it affects you, and it can effect a transformation in your being, a transformation in your life, in your heart, in your [[soul]], in your view of things, in your aspirations, in your [[Desire|desires]], etc. So yes, theatre; theatre needs forms. But knowing they're theatre doesn't take anything away from the power that these different, let's say, forms of self, the different senses of self, can wield[[Daimon, Refracted#It's formed but it's theatre|.]] ^2-1
###### 2-2
We also mentioned already in a talk that there's this kind of dance across the range of the [[imaginal]] [[Middle Way]]. So the [[imaginal]] [[Middle Way]] might seem [[Nondualism|neither real nor not real]]. It can seem, just like the [[emptiness]] [[Middle Way]], like a very narrow path, that it's a kind of razor's edge of precision in terms of reification and non-reification, etc. But actually, there may be - I think it's helpful to conceive of rather this [[Middle Way]] is kind of more of a broad boulevard, and so we have this possibility to reify less at times or more at times, across that range that still constitutes basically a sense of theatre with regard to an [[image]] or a [[Soul|sensing with soul]]. We'll come back to that, hopefully, in this talk[[Daimon, Refracted#The imaginal Middle Way is more a boulevard|.]] ^2-2
###### 2-3
I think in the last [[retreat]] that we did at [[Gaia House]], the _Roots into the Ground of [[Soul]]_, I tried to give an analogy, a metaphor for the necessity, if you like, for [[soul]], of the [[Imaginal|imaginal sense]] beginning to involve and enliven and dimensionalize, etc., the [[The Self|sense of self]]. So that oftentimes we talk about an [[image]] as other - the [[image]] feels like it's other. Not always, of course; we've touched on that. The [[image]] is other - it's an object. But it's important, in time [for the [[The Self|sense of self]] to become [[imaginal]]]. It might not happen immediately with a certain [[image]], and again, back to the questions of pacing, etc. And with some [[Image|images]], or some experiences [[Soul|sensing with soul]], etc., it doesn't always need, it's not always important that [[the self]] becomes [[image]]. It might be just fine for this other to be [[image]] and the sense of the [[imaginal]] doesn't spread to involve [[the self]] sometimes. But if one looks, over time, at one's sort of [[Habit|tendencies]] or patterns with regard to [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]] and [[Soul|sensing with soul]], and one notices that, for instance, "Oh, it's the _other_ that's always divine, and I don't tend to sense my own [[divinity]], because the [[The Self|sense of self]] has not become [[imaginal]]," if one senses, if one recognizes, looking back over a stretch of time with many [[Image|images]] and one sees, "Oh, that's really quite rare," then one might be recognizing there an imbalance[[Daimon, Refracted#Imbalance between sensing the other and sensing self as imaginal|.]] ^2-3
###### 2-4
I gave this analogy, as I was saying, on the last [[retreat]], of a fountain. You can imagine like a fountain, a stone fountain in one of those squares, in a city or a village, in a piazza or whatever it is. If you imagine this fountain, the water shoots up out of the sort of central nozzle, and we could say, in this analogy, that's kind of [[psyche]]'s creations and discoveries rising up from the central nozzle, this sort of infinite and endless outpouring of the inclination to make [[soul]], the [[desire]] to make [[soul]], and the raw material of [[soul]]. So the water comes up out of the central nozzle, and then, as it does with fountains, it falls back down. And that central nozzle is central in a stone tray, maybe a circular stone tray. In falling back down, if the water just falls back down on one side of the fountain and not around the whole area, around all the different sides of that circle, then if the stone's not too heavy and there's a lot of water - again, analogies get stretched, but - if it just falls on one side, that basin and the whole fountain is going to tip over. It's going to be made lopsided and eventually kind of lose its balance, fall, and maybe shatter, if it's lopsided[[Daimon, Refracted#Simile stone fountain|.]] ^2-4
###### 3-1
If the water is falling down _equally_, or relatively equally over the different areas of the circumference of this circular basin, then there's more balance there. I've put this out there a few times now, but really stressing its importance: [[soul]] wants self, other, and world to become [[image]]. So where there's, let's say, an [[image]] that's an other, feels like an erotic object that maybe I'm sensing it as divine, etc., there's a natural tendency - and again, it might have its own, let's say, natural pace, if we can even use such terms - for the sense of [[the self]], also, and then the world in [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]], to also become [[image]]. So the initial [[image]] might have been an [[image]] of another, and working with that, if we don't get in the way, if we allow [[soul]] to do what it wants to do (which is to make more [[soul]]), then self and world, as well as this other, will become [[soul]]. I hope that makes sense. Without that, as I said, there will be a tipping over. So there will be, for instance, very little [[equanimity]] if just this other is divine but I'm not, especially if that other is a human other whose [[divinity]] I am sensing because I am sensing them with [[soul]], and _I_ am not - I remain flat or lacking in [[divinity]], etc[[Daimon, Refracted#Soul wants self other and world to become image|.]] ^3-1
###### 3-2
When we talk about [[The Self|self, other, world]] becoming [[image]], or [[soul]] wanting self, other, and world to become [[image]], all, then we also have to point out: it doesn't have to happen in any order. I have been sometimes sitting, for instance, teaching a [[retreat]], and the yogis, the [[Sangha|Saṅgha]], become [[image]] for me first, and then it might spread to the world, and to me, include the [[Imaginal|imaginal sense]] - [[the self]] gets subsumed, involved, kneaded into the [[imaginal]] [[soulmaking]] and the creativity and discovery of that. So it can happen in any order. It might start with a [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]]. It might start from some lovely sense of [[nature]] opening up, some [[Imaginal|imaginal sense]], some [[Soul|sensing with soul]], either of one object or of the totality of one's environment, and _then_ move to [[the self]]. So any order is possible. But over the long-term, we want to get a sense that the waters of [[soul]] are allowed to flow all ways, all those three ways - [[The Self|self, other, world]]. The order is not important[[Daimon, Refracted#Any order is possible|.]] ^3-2
###### 3-3
So that's something to check, and what I really want to talk about tonight is [[the self]] becoming [[image]]. So that's a general point in terms of contextualizing it. We could go further with that and actually [[Delineations|delineate]] other aspects of being, of [[experience]], that also will tend to become [[Soul|ensouled]] if we let the [[soulmaking dynamic]] and process do its thing, if we don't get in the way, or block it, or inhibit it in some way. So we could say also that [[eros]] will become dimensionalized, divinized. Our own [[eros]] will become an [[Imaginal|erotic-imaginal object]] for us. And in fact, any aspect of our being that sort of comes into the orbit of our [[attention]] will, when the [[soulmaking]] is happening, at a certain point, it will get drawn into the [[soulmaking dynamic]] and hence become [[imaginal]]. So [[The Self|self, other, world]], other aspects too. But it's important that self also becomes [[imaginal]] at some point, or sometimes, at least, and that can happen in any order[[Daimon, Refracted#Any aspect of our being can be drawn into the soulmaking dynamic|.]] ^3-3
###### 3-4
In a way, like I said, we could say this is just what [[soul]] will naturally do, left to its own devices, if it isn't blocked. But still, we can investigate that whole movement a little bit more, and at times we can encourage or help it, and that's quite interesting, to explore that. So I think I already mentioned but I didn't really fill it out, you know, sometimes what happens is we're dealing with something that's touching the heart, and maybe touching the heart in a difficult way, whatever this issue is, or a very lovely way, but we see that we [[desire]] something. Maybe that [[desire]] is already [[eros]]. Maybe it's [[desire]]. Maybe it's a painful kind of [[desire]], or it's stuck in a painful place. One possibility sometimes - again, being quite deft in the touch here, and delicate in the sort of manoeuvring, rather than formulaic and yanking things around - but one possibility then is to almost like externalize [[the self]] who loves this or that, [[the self]] who has [[desire]] for this or that, or has [[eros]] for this or that. So one's feeling it in oneself, and even getting to that point, it might be that _that_ was a journey, even to recognize, "Oh, I have [[desire]] for this," or "Wrapped up in this complicated _[[dukkha]]_ that I feel afflicted by right now or lost in, actually as part of the whole constellation of _[[dukkha]]_, there is [[desire]]." There will always be [[desire]] when there's _[[dukkha]]_, and that goes back to the teaching of the OCD practice, the Opening to the Current of [[Desire]][[Daimon, Refracted#Externalizing the self who loves this or that|.]] ^3-4
###### 4-1
But often there's [[love]] too: I [[love]] this or that. It's wrapped up with [[desire]], of course: I [[love]] this or that, I have [[eros]] for this or that, I have [[desire]] for this or that. But externalizing [[the self]]. So here's all this complex _[[dukkha]]_; I recognize that one strand of it is my [[love]] for this or that, or my [[desire]] or [[eros]] for this or that. And 'externalizing' it means let the one who loves this or that, the one who [[Desire|desires]] this or that, let that become [[image]]. She/he/they [[love]] this or that. So almost putting it in the third person and letting it constellate as an [[image]], which then obviously has echoing and mirroring and kind of maybe feels a bit like myself but is also other. Sometimes that's a really skilful move - again, if it's deftly and delicately done, and handled without too much pressure, or clunkiness, or demand, or formulaic sort of going through the motions[[Daimon, Refracted#Let that he she they become image|.]] ^4-1
###### 4-2
She/he/they who [[love]] this or that, she/he/they who [[desire]] or have [[eros]] for this or that, and then, being with that [[image]], it might be that one actually recognizes, "Oh," one has [[eros]] for, there's an erotic relationship with that self that we've just externalized. So let it be other, but it becomes [[imaginal]]. It might start as just a sort of more flat [[image]], but as one recognizes the [[eros]], as one recognizes the [[beauty]] there, it might become [[image]]. And sometimes it's easier to have that sense of [[eros]] and [[beauty]] when it's externalized like that. We have all kinds of reasons and social taboos and cultural conditionings and whatnot, and contractions of being, and psychology - it's harder to have that, to recognize the [[beauty]] and the [[dimensionality]], and to have an erotic relationship with oneself. So one kind of externalizes it by just making it [[image]]. Don't worry if it's not [[imaginal]] at first. It can very soon _become_ [[imaginal]], more fully [[imaginal]], with the [[eros]] there[[Daimon, Refracted#Sometimes it's easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it's externalized like that|.]] ^4-2
###### 4-3
So the one who [[Desire|desires]] and loves opening, the one who [[Desire|desires]] and loves to be touched, that becomes an [[image]], and one sees, as I said, the [[beauty]], the [[dimensionality]], the [[eternality]]. There's [[eros]] there. There's reverence. And one recognizes the echoing, the mirroring: it's me, and it's not me. But that might have come, this [[Imaginal|imaginal sense]] of the one who [[Desire|desires]] and loves opening, the one who [[Desire|desires]] and loves to be touched, or as someone else said, "the one who is faithful and devoted to [[beauty]]." All these - these are actual examples from interviews, but they came out of something, they came out of a condition of being that wasn't at all clear to start with; it was just a [[Contraction|contracted]] sort of tangle of lots of different painful elements, [[history]], and psychology, and situation, and [[The Self|self-view]], etc. But as this [[image]] was supported to come to [[birth]] and to emerge there, then it reflects back on [[the self]]. In [[Infinity|the infinite]] echoing and mirroring, one recognizes something. One recognizes something about oneself, and oneself has become [[image]], in a sense, although there's this kind of _other_, it's _other_. It doesn't matter. Some magic, some [[alchemy]] has happened in the [[The Self|sense of self]]. So it might take a little while to get there, because one has to kind of deal with the tangle of _[[dukkha]]_ sometimes, or it might not be that tangled, it might not even be _[[dukkha]]_ to start with. But then these steps, if you like - I don't want to make it too formulaic - then the [[beauty]] is revealed, the [[eros]] is revealed, the whole self-sense can open up[[Daimon, Refracted#Examples from interviews|.]] ^4-3
###### 5-1
So this is important, and there are so many possibilities, working with [[image]], of the way [[the self]] gets pulled into the [[soulmaking dynamic]], pulled into the [[Imaginal|imaginal sense]], how the [[Imaginal|imaginal sense]] spreads to include [[the self]]. Someone [[Retreat|on retreat]] at [[Gaia House]] was sharing with me - this was a while ago - they were in the garden, and a blackbird flew into a window of [[Gaia House]] and was wounded, fell to the ground and was wounded. And she heard the sound, saw it, found the blackbird in the sort of undergrowth, in the flowerbed or something. It was clearly wounded, and so she just sat with it, and she stayed with it in its wounded condition, in its [[Dukkha|suffering]], and stayed there with [[compassion]], with care, with concern, but also with a troubled heart. There was quite a lot of _[[Papanca|papañca]]_ at first with that situation. Despite the [[compassion]], etc., there was, "What should I do?", and the being was stirred up, partly in a not very helpful way. But then, as she sat with it, or later, actually, the whole thing became [[image]], became [[imaginal]]. The whole scene, and the blackbird, and the wounding there became [[imaginal]], and in our framework, we say when something becomes more [[imaginal]] a lot of the unhelpful [[Papanca|complication]] and [[Papanca|proliferation]] that we call _[[Papanca|papañca]]_ diminishes. So as the [[imaginal]] grows, the _[[Papanca|papañca]]_ diminishes. As the _[[Papanca|papañca]]_ grows, the [[imaginal]] diminishes[[Daimon, Refracted#Story wounded blackbird|.]] ^5-1
###### 5-2
So somehow in being with it, and being with it later back in her room, the _[[Papanca|papañca]]_ declined, peace came, and a [[healing]] sense came, something that was [[healing]] in the [[soul]]. She went back in the morning to check on the blackbird, but it was dead. Well, actually it was gone, so either it was presumed dead or a fox got it or something. The next day, the [[image]] returned. She was reporting this in an interview, and I asked her, in the [[image]], is the bird alone, or are you in the [[image]], sitting with it? And she said actually the [[image]] was of her sitting with the bird, rather than the bird alone. Both would have been fine; it was more I just wanted to get a sense of what the actual [[image]] was, what it included, and what the possibilities were. But there was something, I think - a particular possibility or direction gets included if she was in the [[image]]. It's not better or worse. It's just a particular possibility, a direction, gets included when the [[image]] is the wounded bird _and_ [[the self]] there[[Daimon, Refracted#The image included Blackbird _and_ the self|.]] ^5-2
###### 5-3
Sometimes, in a kind of simple way this works, it's almost like then implicit in that [[image]] - I didn't actually linger on it; I kind of, I think, said very little, because I wanted to let the process work by itself, without me leading it or suggesting it too much, suggesting too much a direction or what needed to happen. But one of the sort of basic possibilities of working with [[image]] in this way is that sometimes we don't see things about ourselves, and sometimes some aspect or quality of our being comes more clearly to be recognized. But it's not just that. There's more to it than that. So in this case, her natural goodness - deep, natural, almost innocent, almost childlike care for beings, something that, my sense, was very natural to her [[soul]]. It's part of her [[soul]]. So we recognize something, recognize our own positive qualities, etc. But there's more to it than that, because the whole thing can then become dimensionalized and divinized, which is different than just recognizing, "Oh, I'm good at this, and I have that quality," and that sort of flatly conceived psychology of self-esteem or whatever. That may be one level, but then there's the possibility, when things become [[imaginal]], with the [[dimensionality]], with the theatre, with the [[eternality]], with the [[divinity]] and [[Divinity|theophany]], etc., that it can become more than that. Still, that basic level of recognizing certain qualities of oneself, really, through an [[image]], is important. As I said, sometimes it's easier when it's external, externalized like that[[Daimon, Refracted#It is and it is more than "I have this quality"|.]] ^5-3
###### 5-4
We'll give a couple more examples. Someone a while ago came into an interview and reported two [[Image|images]], and was actually interested how to connect the [[Image|images]] with [[the self]] and with the particularities of herself, etc. So one [[image]] was a kind of dramatic [[image]] of a queen with a long robe, and the robe was trailing blood. So she's leaving this trail of blood from her long robe. I have it written down somewhere - I can't find it. Yeah, anyway. So that was the main part of the [[image]]. Who is this queen? What's her story? I can't remember if _I_ asked that; I think I did, or she might have wondered, or she might have just offered the background story. And she was concerned, in offering this background story that, "Oh, but I thought [[Image|images]] were not supposed to be [[Stories|narrative]]." We touched on this, I think, in a Q & A in the _Roots into the Ground of [[Soul]]_ [[retreat]].^[Rob Burbea, "On Practising with Images (Q & A)" (26 March 2019), question six, https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/58613] Sometimes you get an [[image]] which is not so much a [[Stories|narrative]] [[image]] as much as it has a kind of backstory. It has a kind of [[imaginal]] background. So one understands, almost actually implicitly - not like watching a series of events, but one understands implicitly the story or the [[Stories|narrative]], in this case, of this queen, or whatever the [[imaginal]] character is[[Daimon, Refracted#Image Queen trailing blood|.]] ^5-4
###### 6-1
So in a way, it's part of the [[image]]; it's just more in the background and intuited implicitly, but it has a [[Stories|narrative]] structure, and still the whole retains a sense of [[eternality]], of 'always already happening,' of [[Unfabricated|timelessness]], etc. So that's actually not a problem with [[Image|images]]. And even if they're [[Stories|narrative]], sometimes it's not a problem, but let's just say that for now. And getting a sense of this queen trailing blood, and her poise and strength. I can't remember - I think, again, it's almost like I might have had to ask questions to tease out the character, and the quality, and maybe a bit of the backstory of this queen. As she was sharing this [[image]], the [[image]] became alive for me, so we were entering into it together, and I felt like I was perceiving the [[image]] just as much as she was. It became, in a way, a common object between us, which is a very lovely thing to happen, as many of you will know. I asked, "Do you notice her [[Insight|wisdom]]? This queen has a particular kind of [[Insight|wisdom]], a shrewdness, but without any of the negative implications of that word, 'shrewd.' There's a kind of practical [[Insight|wisdom]], a diplomatic [[Insight|wisdom]]. Do you notice her kind of attuned, appropriate, measured responses to her subjects and to the people in her court, etc.? Do you notice her dignity, her [[nobility]]?[[Daimon, Refracted#The queen became a common object among the yogi and Rob|"]] ^6-1
###### 6-2
So all this was, to me, sort of pregnant in the [[image]] and needed a little bit of teasing out to become more palpable, to become more recognizable, and to be recognized, to be witnessed, to be made clear. Again, as a stage of practice, it's possible then to resonate with her qualities. So I see poise, strength, dignity, [[nobility]], [[Insight|wisdom]], attunement, appropriate response, measured response - all these individual and connected qualities, take your time in the [[meditation]] and just be with them, and witness them, and put the [[energy body]], and the [[soul]], and the heart, and the sensibility in touch with, just by virtue of opening to them, and witnessing them, and appreciating them. One opens one's being to those particular qualities, and the being, the [[soul]], the [[energy body]], the [[emotions]] start resonating with those qualities. And in so doing, we absorb those qualities. We absorb, if you like, into our life in ways that can actually then become manifest, practically manifest, really manifest, in our real, physical [[relationships]], over time. We absorb those qualities[[Daimon, Refracted#It's possible to resonate with the qualities of the imaginal figure and absorb them over time|.]] ^6-2
###### 6-3
Now, sometimes people practise with [[Image|images]] and _that's_ the total scope of the intention. Sometimes people even practise [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] practices to do that. It's great, you know, and it's a very powerful way of practising. Sometimes people practise _[[Metta|mettā]]_ just by imagining [[Avalokiteshvara|Kuan Yin]], [[Avalokiteshvara|Avalokiteśvara]], or [[Jesus]], or whatever, and their [[love]], and just beholding that, opening the being to that, and through that, there's this resonance and this absorption, and it begins to ignite and empower those qualities and those capacities in our heart, in our life, in our relationship, etc. So that's wonderful. In _our_ paradigm, we're saying yes, great intention, and wonderful that that happens, but remember the [[fullness of intention]]. So the [[image]] is not here just to serve me; I am serving the [[image]]. And the [[fullness of intention]] means the fullness of [[soulmaking]] here, rather than just this or that quality becoming empowered. This or that quality becoming empowered in my life, and in my [[relationships]], and in my expression, in my speech, in my action, etc., may be _part_ of serving the [[image]]. It may be part of what the [[image]] _wants_ from me. It may be part of doing my [[duty]] to the [[daimon]], etc. But really helpful in our paradigm to remember the fuller scope, or the [[fullness of intention]] - actually the fullness of [[soulmaking]]. And included in that can be this absorption of qualities, this empowerment of different aspects and capabilities of our being[[Daimon, Refracted#But the image is not here just to serve me; I am serving the image|.]] ^6-3
###### 7-1
And then we talked, too, about a situation back home with some voluntary work that she was doing, and the relationship with that community, and finding her voice there, and being able to speak up with strength. She saw all that was relevant, there was this echoing/mirroring, or _part_, again, part of [[Infinity|the infinite]] echoing/mirroring was its relevance in the echoing and mirroring to these particular situations with regard to community and how she manifested and spoke up there[[Daimon, Refracted#Infinite echoing mirroring|.]] ^7-1
###### 7-2
A second [[image]] that was shared was a naked goddess who lives in a tree, resides in a tree. One particularly salient feature of this goddess was that she has her legs open, so her legs are spread. And the yogi shared, you know, "It's actually not sexual, but she's opening _my_ legs too." So there's already a relationship of [[the self]] as meditator, the [[The Self|sense of self]] in relationship with this [[image]], and this [[image]], this naked goddess living in the tree, is very gently opening my legs. It doesn't seem sexual. Something very delicate happening. There was a little concern from this yogi. She said, "I'm trying not to become ethereal in the [[image]], and I'm trying to retain my [[The Self|particular self]]." So again, her initial question with these two [[Image|images]] was, "What's the relationship between these somewhat puzzling [[Image|images]] and [[the self]]?" She couldn't seem to kind of connect them or ground them. She said, "In this [[image]], I'm really trying not to become ethereal, and to retain my [[The Self|particular self]].[[Daimon, Refracted#Image Naked goddess who lives in a tree opening of the legs|"]] ^7-2
###### 7-3
So you don't have to always do that. Even if you become ethereal, it's not a problem. It's not a problem. To become ethereal - we've talked about this - how does the [[energy body]] feel, and that range from sort of insubstantiality/ethereality, to dense and substantial, and everything in between, as one of the ranges of the [[energy body]] [[perception]]. It's all open, and to become ethereal is not a problem. It's just what's happening with this particular [[image]] at that time. It might be very appropriate to this particular [[image]]. I think in this case it _was_. And also to become ethereal, if my [[energy body]] becomes ethereal, it's not the same as melting in union and losing the twoness, losing the differentiation between self and [[image]], and with that, the [[eros]], etc. So there will be the reflecting and the echoing in the life from the twoness; I don't have to _become_ the [[image]]. Even when there's a [[The Self|sense of self]] and the other, there will still be this infinite reflecting and echoing, just because it's what the [[imaginal]] is and does. It's part of it[[Daimon, Refracted#It's not a problem if you become ethereal|.]] ^7-3
###### 7-4
And again, there was a sense here of the [[image]] being expressed, and then shared, as if I could sense it as well, I was living that [[image]] at the same time. We were living it together. But I was careful. I didn't want to - always question my inclinations and responses and intuitions, so checking it out with her, "Is this right? Is that right?" And to me, there was a real sense of exquisiteness. So this naked goddess had a real exquisite sort of refined, very sensitive, very delicate quality. I asked her if that was the case, and she said yes. Again, it's like, sometimes, is it not part of _your_ [[soul]], this exquisiteness that you see in her, in this goddess? Is it not part of _your_ [[soul]] and _your_ particular kind of [[Blessing|gifts]] in this life, your particular kind of exquisiteness are being mirrored and echoed in this goddess? Or we could say, more powerfully, I think, we could say your life, your being, your personality, the way you are with your [[Embodiment|body]], your sensibility echoes and mirrors the exquisiteness, the particular kinds of exquisiteness of this goddess. There's a refraction there. They won't be exactly the same, but there's this emanation that then gets interpreted or reflected in our particular ways. And might then this sense of exquisiteness also be part of what, so to speak, the gods, the [[Daimon|daimons]], the [[Daimon|angels]] ask of you[[Daimon, Refracted#The particular kind of exquisiteness were mirrored in the image|?]] ^7-4
###### 8-1
So again, not to identify with it, and not to make a rigid, tight ego-belief and ego-view around it. This is the delicacy of the [[Middle Way]]. There's a way that can have all the power, witnessing that exquisiteness, a conceiving of it, and sensing more than conceiving, sensing of it, having the [[Soul|heart and soul]]-sense of our being and our persona and our [[Stories|narrative]] in this life being a very particular refraction or emanation of that particular exquisiteness of that [[image]]. And not to identify with it, but to feel the power of that. And with that, is this not part of what the gods, the [[Daimon|daimons]], the [[image]], the goddess, the [[Daimon|angels]] are asking of you? So the [[image]] is brought into a very powerful relationship with [[the self]], but it's got all the lightness - I mean, partly helped by the ethereality - but it's got all the lightness of touch of non-identification, or not _over_-identifying, put it that way, and making a rigid ego-identity around it. So there's the [[duty]] wrapped up in it, and the [[The Self|sense of self]], and the way this [[image]] then informs and flows into [[the self]]. Again, there are different levels of the way we can sense and conceive this, but[[Daimon, Refracted#Our persona being a very particular refraction of the quality of the image|.]] ^8-1
###### 8-2
So there might be, with a lot of these [[Image|images]] - again, whether they're [[Image|images]] that are sensed as other, or [[the self]] becomes [[image]], there's the sense of gift, but also [[duty]], ask. And that's part of the deal. It's part of the deal of [[Imaginal|imaginal work]] as _we_ conceive it, and part of the deal of [[the self]] getting embroiled, involved, or worked on in the [[soulmaking dynamic]], in the [[imaginal]] process. You can already hear the beginnings of a different range of views of self, and conceptions of self, and psychologies about self than are maybe more sort of common or dominant in contemporary psychology, etc. Someone asked me a while ago, "I feel like" - they were talking about themselves, now - "I feel like I want to leave an impression. It's like I want to make an imprint, or leave an imprint on" - I think she was saying on _me,_ but also on others. And she was very sceptical about this [[desire]]. It's like, "Why do I have this ...?" This is a person who has done a lot of practice, a lot of, let's say, mainstream [[Meditation|Dharma practice]], and Advaita, and different things, and non-dual practice, and that kind of thing. So she was very wary of this impulse and intention and [[desire]] that she noticed within herself, wanting to leave or make an imprint on others, or on a particular other, or particular others. She said, "Why?" And she was judging it. It's easy to assume, under the rubric of many psychological or spiritual [[Conceptual framework|conceptual frameworks]], that this is ego. "Why do I have to impress people? Why do I have to try and make this imprint? Why do I have to be important that way?", etc[[Daimon, Refracted#Sense of gift but also duty; Story wanting to leave an impression|.]] ^8-2
###### 8-3
So we were talking about this, and you can actually ask, "_Who_ wants this?" So her tendency was to be very suspicious of it, and because she had, I suppose, practised so long in paradigms that put aside [[the self]], move towards dissolving [[the self]] and just dissolving it in some kind of ultimate [[oneness]], etc., there was this suspicion. So, "It can only be an ego thing." It was troubling her, really, like some kind of itch or something that she wanted to get rid of. But I said, "We can ask _who_ wants this, _who_ wants to make an imprint?" Maybe it's what the [[soul]] wants. Maybe it's the way it communicates with other souls, if you like, or we could say amongst its parts, if we're parts of a World [[Soul]], if we're conceiving of the [[soul]] that way. The way it communicates amongst its parts is by making impressions on the other parts, or one [[soul]] communicates with another by making an impression. And that's what the [[soul]] _wants_. So, you know, if I think about [[John Coltrane]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Peter Maxwell Davies]], [[James Hillman]], [[Etty Hillesum]], friends who I [[love]] deeply, these are all, for me, in my life, deep, beautiful, precious imprints on and in my [[soul]]. They _are_ my [[soul]], or they're part of it. My [[soul]] is informed, has the impression, has the stamp of these deep [[soul]]-[[Image|images]] - Coltrane, Hendrix, this friend or that friend, etc. And I treasure that. I treasure that. I _want_ to be impressed upon in that way. I want to be impressed upon. Don't we, as souls, _want_ to be impressed upon by [[soul]], and by what is [[Soul|soulful]][[Daimon, Refracted#Maybe the soul communicates by making an impression|?]] ^8-3
###### 9-1
In that [[desire]] to imprint on others I think is actually the nascent sense of an [[imaginal]] self. So it's not necessarily the ego. Again, it's the [[soul]], and [[soul]] expresses itself in [[Image|images]] to a great extent. It's not just the ego-self that wants to make an imprint, it's the [[soul]]-self, and the [[image]], the [[imaginal]] self, or the [[imaginal]] selves, the budding sense of that that wants to make an imprint on others, a deep [[soul]]-imprint on others. And that [[imaginal]] self, again, it's me and not me. It's [[Nondualism|neither real nor not real]]. But somehow it's very profoundly me. Somehow it's very profoundly me, maybe more profoundly me than anything else. [[The self]] needs to become [[image]]. It wants to become [[image]]. [[Soul]] wants to make things [[imaginal]], to discover their [[imaginal]] [[Dimensionality|dimensions]]. And it needs to imprint. It wants to express itself. It wants to connect with other souls. This is how [[soul]] grows. [[Soulmaking]] _is_ being impressed upon. The sense of [[Soul|soulfulness]] _is_ to be impressed upon[[Daimon, Refracted#The imaginal sense is me and not me neither real nor not real|.]] ^9-1
###### 9-2
If we don't allow the [[imaginal]] [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] of self, etc., then that impulse to imprint stays as ego - in other words, flatly conceived self - and not [[eros]], but [[craving]]. And the only recourse then is to try to live that out, trying to impress people from this flat level, trying to make an imprint, an impression on people, but it's all flatly conceived, and that's going to be misery for everyone, probably. Or the only other recourse, if we're inhibiting or disallowing or dismissing the possibility of this whole [[soul]]-dimension of self, is to dwell in [[Anatta|no-self]] (whatever that means), and try and live one's life with this kind of ideal of [[Anatta|no-self]], whether that's "I'm just this process of [[Skandhas|aggregates]]," or "I'm just [[love]]," or whatever it is, or "I'm just [[awareness]]," or "I'm just [[Dharmadhatu|cosmic consciousness]]" or whatever. And again, in the way _I_ would understand it, that's great - those particular views of [[Anatta|no-self]] are wonderful to move in and out of - but to try and live a whole life with all the complexities and demands and particularities of our ways of loving and our creativity and our duties, etc., it doesn't really work[[Daimon, Refracted#We should allow ourselves imaginal dimensions of self|.]] ^9-2
###### 9-3
So without the imaginalizing, the dimensionalizing, the divinizing, the theophanizing of self, our possibilities are very limited, and they don't really work. So, in a way, this person was bumping into repeatedly the failure of a paradigm of [[Anatta|no-self]] to kind of comprehensively address the totality of her being and her needs (spiritual, [[Soul|soulful]], etc.). We're just so used to a certain idea: "This is right. This is spiritual. This is psychologically healthy," or whatever, and something else wants to happen. Partly what allows it to happen is to conceive it in a way that gives it some respect, and believes there's a treasure there, believes there's a necessity of [[soul]] there. So [[The Self|self, other, world]], and maybe also one's [[desire]], one's [[eros]] - there might be [[eros]] to imprint on others, this [[desire]] to imprint on others, on the [[soul]] of others: my [[soul]] [[Desire|desires]] deeply to make this impression, and there's not [[craving]], not even just [[desire]], but _[[eros]]_ there. But self/other/world/[[eros]] need to become [[imaginal]], need to become [[Imaginal|erotic-imaginal objects]] for us. Then there is [[unfathomability]], [[Divinity|sacredness]], [[beauty]] in these, in [[the self]], in other, in world, in [[desire]]. Not only _beyond_ self or other, world, or [[eros]], or in their [[Emptiness|fading]]. The [[unfathomability]], the [[divinity]], the [[beauty]] - it's _in_ them. They are expressions of it, broadening the expressions of it[[Daimon, Refracted#Without imaginalizing the self our possibilities are very limited|.]] ^9-3
###### 10-1
And I think I touched on this very briefly in an earlier talk in this series, but of course, then, if we allow this and begin to sense it, or allow ourselves to sense it and conceive of it as a [[Soul|soul-desire]] - it's not ego, it's [[soul]], or if it's allowed to do its thing, it can be [[soul]] as opposed to ego; if we can conceive of it the right way, it can be [[soul]] rather than ego - but of course there's _[[dukkha]]_ there if it seems like we're _not_ making an imprint. The [[Daimon|angels]] want to make an imprint. They need to. Maybe one kind of conception is that it's what _we're_ here for. It's what human beings are here for, to express the divinities, the [[divinity]], the [[Daimon|angels]] and their particular faces, the faces of the gods. We are here to express the faces of the gods, and the [[Daimon|angels]] want that, and they want that from us. So that the _[[dukkha]]_ of feeling like, "I'm not imprinting. There is no connection there in what I'm trying to put out or communicate of my being," the _[[dukkha]]_ might not even be an ego-_dukkha_, primarily. It might be the _[[dukkha]]_ of that whole sense of, "This is what the [[Daimon|angels]] want, and this is what I'm here for, and it's frustrated, it's blocked. There isn't the reception there.[[Daimon, Refracted#That's what we humans are here for express the faces of the angels|"]] ^10-1
###### 10-2
We could say, if we just play with this idea, that the ego's [[desire]] to impress is a kind of [[contraction]] of or a dim echo of the [[soul]]'s [[desire]] to impress. So again, we could make a whole psychology of this kind of premise or maxim, "The [[soul]] wants [[soulmaking]]. The [[soul]] loves [[soulmaking]]," and that's the urge, that's the fundamental movement in life, and everything else can kind of shake down from that. And what happens sometimes if we play with this conception is that that [[soul]]'s [[desire]] to impress gets shrunken, or flattened, or tightened, or [[Contraction|contracted]] around, and so it becomes a [[contraction]] or, as I said, a dim echo of the [[soul]]'s [[desire]] to impress, and it manifests as ego, and it feels like ego. Something's got shrunk. So that kind of conception is quite a different conception of self, and reading or interpretation, hermeneutic of what we're doing in our life, what we're trying to do, or what, if you like, the [[Daimon|angels]] are trying to do _through_ us - my [[Daimon|daimons]], your [[Daimon|daimons]], are trying to do through you, with you, as you[[Daimon, Refracted#This is quite a different hermeneutic of what we're doing in our life|.]] ^10-2
###### 10-3
Some of you will have heard this story from [[Oscar Wilde]]. I don't know where he was going, but he was travelling between countries, and the customs officer asked him, "Do you have anything to declare?" And he sort of said, "Only my genius." It's funny - I've shared a few quotes of [[Oscar Wilde]] before, and sometimes it seems to me he - I don't know if it's the case, but it's almost like you can hear these little witty quips that he has, and these little retorts that he has to certain situations, on two levels. At one level, it's just a funny sort of [[The Self|self-aggrandizement]] kind of thing, declaring that he's a genius in the way that we usually understand that word. But that word, 'genius,' actually originally referred to something like a [[daimon]]. So it wasn't a person _was_ a genius; a person _had_ a genius, a particular genius, like their [[Daimon|angel]], or their spirit, or their [[daimon]][[Daimon, Refracted#A person has a particular genius|.]] ^10-3
###### 10-4
So: "Do you have anything to declare? Are you bringing anything with you into this country through customs?" "Am I bringing anything with me? Only my genius. So you can see I have nothing here, and very few bags or whatever it is, but I'm bringing this invisible [[daimon]] that you can't see, like illegal goods might be hidden." He's declaring that. I don't know if that's what he meant, but as I said, a lot of times I get these kind of double-levelled interpretive possibilities, possibilities of interpretation of things he says. And then what's the relationship with that could be very different than the first interpretation of just a kind of ego thing or "I'm a genius. I'm declaring my genius. I'm a really smart guy," or whatever it is. Not ego. It could be the conception of that [[daimon]], of that genius in the original sense: "It's him, not me." And so there's a relationship of humility with that[[Daimon, Refracted#Oscar Wilde at the customs|.]] ^10-4
###### 11-1
But this has really gone out of fashion. If it was ever mainstream in any culture, I don't know, but it's certainly gone out of fashion. I remember in a [[music]] [[history]] class studying about Stravinsky, the famous, brilliant twentieth century composer. He wrote _Rite of Spring,_ some of you will know. And he was being interviewed by his assistant, [[Robert Craft]], and they recorded it at one point. They were talking about the composition of _The Rite of Spring_ back in the early twentieth century, and this was much later. [[Robert Craft]] got him talking, etc., and at some point Stravinsky said something like, "I was the [[vessel]] through which _The Rite of Spring_ was born, through which that [[music]] was born." And then a little while later, [[Robert Craft]] quoted him back as saying that, and Stravinsky said, "I never said that!" [laughs] [[Robert Craft]] said, "You did. It's on the tape recorder." It's kind of slightly taboo, because, I think, like so many other things - [[sexuality]] and all kinds of things - we have such a confused notion of what we're allowed to think and say, and how we're allowed to view self, and what's taboo, and what's regarded as ego, etc[[Daimon, Refracted#Strawinsky as vessel for the Rite of Spring|.]] ^11-1
###### 11-2
So in the flow of the conversation, he was expressing perhaps a certain just natural [[perception]] of that, of being in the service to something - in this case, the service of - the [[Daimon|angel]] _was_ a piece of [[music]]. [[Etienne Souriau|Étienne Souriau]], the French philosopher, sometimes talked about "the [[Daimon|Angel]] of the work." So this composition, this magnificent, revolutionary twentieth century composition, _The Rite of Spring_, it was or had an [[Daimon|angel]], and that [[Daimon|angel]] wanted something out of Stravinsky. But then he said, "I never said that." "Yes, you did." [laughs] So we're [[Constriction|constrained]] and confused by the mixed messages we get about [[the self]]. In so many ways, we live in a very egotistical culture, but we also view that badly, and we judge ourselves or others when it _looks_ like they or we are being egotistical. There's nowhere else, there are no other conceptual levels - the conception is so thin and so limited, and we're just shunting back and forth between a rock and a hard place there. Either ego, because we have no other level to think of, and so we pursue things out of a sense of ego and ego-aggrandizement, _or_ the judgment and denigration of that in ourselves and others. There's nothing else, because the wider [[Conceptual framework|conceptual frameworks]] in the culture offer nothing else. All the [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] have gone, all the possibilities have gone, and there's a real impoverishment there[[Daimon, Refracted#We're constrained and confused by the mixed messages we get about the self|.]] ^11-2
###### 11-3
So Corbin, of course, talked a lot about - actually I, before, talked about - "[[Daimon|the angel out ahead]]." It's almost like a counterpart of ourselves, a second half of our [[soul]], if you like, and our relationship with that through the [[imaginal]], and the importance of that to the sense of who we are, and the direction we have in life, and our duties to that [[Daimon|angel]], etc. And just paraphrasing a passage from one of his books, _Temple and Contemplation_, I think the book's called - in this case he's calling it the "person [[archetype]]." He said, "That's not a symbol of something in _me_. Rather, it is the earthly, human person, it's me, who, by gravitating towards this spiritual person, this angelhood, I represent and typify hypostasis," meaning an existence, a being, of the angelic world[[Daimon, Refracted#Corbin's "person archetype is not something in _me_ but this earthly person gravitating towards this spiritual person|.]] ^11-3
###### 11-4
So the usual [[Ways of looking|way of seeing]] it is, "Oh, this [[image]] is representing some aspect of me." We've talked about this before. "It's representing some aspect of me. The [[image]] is a representation." Turning it around: "No, _I_ represent and typify this [[Daimon|angel]] of the angelic world." And he continues, "The [[Personhood|human being]] is called upon to answer for it on earth."^[Henry Corbin, _Temple and Contemplation_ (London: Routledge, 2013), 171] So again, there's his way of saying this [[Duty|sense of duty]]. Everything is reversed here. He's actually talking about ritual in this passage, so it's how the ritual relates to these kinds of ideas. He says, "Human gestures, human representations and imaginings, are so many methods whereby a [[Personhood|human being]] can be led to typify and exemplify in themselves a celestial existence." By celestial existence, in our language, it's other [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] of being, so there's that [[dimensionality]] node here. Again, he's talking about ritual, but he says, "If a celestial person, if an [[Daimon|angel]], is represented by a particular gesture or word or phase of the ritual, then to observe these is already to exist in the manner of that transcendent person.[[Daimon, Refracted#Human beings can be led to typify and exemplify in themselves a celestial existence|"]] ^11-4
###### 12-1
It's a very different, back-to-front, upside-down view of self and reality. And so, as I said, that brings [[dimensionality]] into our being - and not just the [[dimensionality]] of, let's say, [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s unconscious, a sort of deep, dark well of shameful secrets and inclinations or whatever. This [[dimensionality]], all kinds of [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] there. And yes, [[divinity]], [[Divinity|sacredness]], [[Divinity|theophany]]. Self is dimensionalized, divinized, recognized as sacred, or allowed to flower in a sense of [[Divinity|sacredness]]. Self as [[Divinity|theophany]], or as potential [[Divinity|theophany]]. [[Eternality]] - so this [[Daimon|angel]] out ahead, or this, what he's [[Passion|calling]] in this case the celestial person, is eternal. Our selves are not; human selves don't seem to be. I'm not an expert on Corbin, and his writings are sometimes very dense, and he was very prolific, but sometimes it sounds like he's talking, when he talks about [[Daimon|the angel out ahead]], as if there's just _one_ [[Daimon|angel]] out ahead, or one genius or whatever[[Daimon, Refracted#Self is dimensionalized divinized recognized as sacred|.]] ^12-1
###### 12-2
In the [[Soulmaking|Soulmaking Dharma]], there's not necessarily just one. Going back to the beginning, we're free. There may be many [[Image|images]] - what Hillman calls more polytheistic [[psyche]]: [[Image|images]], [[imaginal]] beings, [[Daimon|angels]] that sometimes are kind of in conflict with each other, or at least move, pull us, draw us, beckon us in different directions; ask of us impossibly divergent things. I mean, it may be that they all refer to some kind of more fundamental or higher dimensional [[archetype]], if you like - I don't know - in some of these paradigms. An [[archetype]], if you remember when I talked about that word, I think it was in _Path of the [[Imaginal]]_, in the original meaning, it meant something without a form. It was rather the principle of forming - forming like this, or forming like that. So that which is not an [[image]], but forms [[Image|images]]. So it might be, if you think about it that way, that it generates many [[Image|images]][[Daimon, Refracted#Polytheistic psyche|.]] ^12-2
###### 12-3
Now, of course, sometimes what we encounter in or with the [[The Self|sense of self]] doesn't feel divine at all. It doesn't feel sacred. And if it feels eternal, it's more just a sense of it seems to be going on forever with its afflictive sort of [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]] or constellation. So sometimes, for example, obviously people, we struggle, especially [[Dominant culture|in our culture]], with the inner critic. This is very, very common, partly, I think, a result of [[Dominant culture|our culture]] - again, of the limited ways of [[Insight|understanding]] [[the self]], limited ways of conceiving [[the self]], but also a result of social fragmentation, individualism, all kinds of things historically. And so I've talked about working with the inner critic in the past. Many years ago, I think, I gave some talks on it. And I gave out a whole set of approaches or things one could do in [[meditation]], both at the time that the inner critic is active, if you like, present, and also when it's not active. And some of those involved working with the imagination with regard to the inner critic, in relationship with the inner critic. But that wasn't [[imaginal]]. So it's working with the imagination, but it's not [[imaginal]], in _our_ sense[[Daimon, Refracted#The inner critic|.]] ^12-3
###### 12-4
But it might be that we can actually allow things to become [[imaginal]] with respect to the inner critic. Some of that might start with just a more deliberate imagination. So I'll give just a couple of possibilities, just to start an exploration, perhaps. Sometimes, maybe, perhaps the inner critic could be seen, in a way, it's part of [[the self]], it's part of the [[psyche]], which, among other things, has taken or become the [[soul]]-locus of power. When the inner critic is badgering us and kind of taking over and hounding us, all the power, or most of the power, has gone _there_. So there is this [[psyche]] with its complexity, this self with its complexity, this [[soul]] with its complexity, and all the power of that [[soul]] seems to be kind of gathered under the purview and domain of that inner critic, and the rest of the being feels weak, collapsed, etc., lacking in power. But it's actually _my_ [[psyche]], yeah? My self, my [[soul]], is part of that[[Daimon, Refracted#Possibilities to allow things to become imaginal with respect to the inner critic|.]] ^12-4
###### 13-1
So a couple of possibilities. Sometimes, or maybe, feeling one's frustration and [[anger]] at the inner critic - so we're back to this [[Vessel|crucible]] thing, and the [[emotions]], and where is the emotion, and where is the kind of point of entry that can allow things to start to become dynamic and galvanize a little bit in terms of certainly liberating process, but maybe even [[soulmaking]] process. Feeling one's frustration, and even one's [[anger]] - one can be so fed up with this inner critic. So instead of getting dragged into listening to the inner critic, actually what else is there? "I'm feeling really fed up. I'm feeling really angry at the inner critic." And that, again, the heat of that emotion, I have to sit with it in the [[energy body]], I have to kind of tease it out of the afflictive mix that's happening at the time[[Daimon, Refracted#1 Sit with the anger at the inner critic|.]] ^13-1
###### 13-2
But in being with it, in holding it, in being with it in the [[energy body]] and recognizing it, and actually letting it heat up, letting that frustration and [[anger]], recognizing there may be a treasure here in the frustration and [[anger]] which I usually would see as a defilement, as a _kilesa_, as something that's not helpful, letting it build up in the [[energy body]], in the [[Alchemy|alchemical]] [[vessel]], in the [[Vessel|crucible]], and out of that, [[image]], an [[image]], might arise. Out of the heat of the frustration and [[anger]] at the inner critic, an [[image]] might arise, and that may well have power in it, because frustration and [[anger]] have a lot of potential power wrapped up in them. And so another, let's say, another part of the [[psyche]], so to speak, is empowered, and it changes the relationship with the inner critic[[Daimon, Refracted#Letting the anger build up in the energy body so that an image might arise|.]] ^13-2
###### 13-3
Another possibility is to go ahead and deliberately imagine - so it might not be [[imaginal]] at first; don't worry; it might never [be] [[imaginal]], and might still be liberating - go ahead and deliberately imagine, for example, destroying the inner critic violently. So whatever it is: smashing it to bits, clunking it on the head, you know, whatever. And that deliberate imagination - again, it may not be [[imaginal]]; it may be liberating without this ever becoming [[imaginal]], or it may become [[imaginal]] - then that, going ahead and deliberately imagining destroying the inner critic violently, may actually then liberate the feeling of [[anger]]. So in the first approach, it was like, can I feel the [[anger]] first? Can I feel the frustration first, and let that constellate an [[image]]? Or it might be that I'm actually playing with the imagination, and _that_ liberates the possibility of feeling that emotion. And in that [[anger]] is power. The third step there would be, can I almost filter out the sense of power in the [[energy body]] from the feeling of [[anger]][[Daimon, Refracted#2 Imagine destroying the inner critic violently|?]] ^13-3
###### 13-4
So those are some possibilities. And again, in that last one I illustrated there, putting those two together, again, there's non-linearity here. It's sort of a tangled ball of wool - I pull on _this_, and it might be that _this_ loosens as well, this other one, this other thread. So there are those possibilities. There's also a slightly different possibility. The inner critic tends to arise more in relation to something we are deeply longing for, or that we actually have [[eros]] for. So someone was talking to me about the inner critic, and I asked her, "When does it come up? Is it just there all the time, or is it certain situations?" And it was coming up actually in relation to, or in the context of, certain situations of public speaking where she really cared about what she was communicating or teaching or whatever it was. Or for a lot of people it comes up in relation to practice, and wanting to practise well[[Daimon, Refracted#The inner critic tends to arise more in relation to something we actually have eros for|.]] ^13-4
###### 14-1
So this is interesting, you know. I'm not saying it's always the case; sometimes there's a more pervasive, low-grade sense of inner critic, of course. But oftentimes it's actually coming up in relation to things that we really care deeply about, or that we really long for, or that we have [[eros]] for. So rather than getting caught up with the inner critic, and what it's saying, and what it's doing, etc., again, it may be possible to let that do its thing, but can I kind of contact the [[eros]] or [[desire]] that's there? I'm judging myself for being a bad meditator or whatever, but actually can I contact the [[eros]] and the [[desire]] to meditate well and deeply, and discover and play in that way? The inner critic's still doing its thing, but I'm just honing the [[attention]], directing it to other elements, other aspects of the tangle of what's going on. With that [[desire]], again, as I touched on earlier, might be wrapped up the _[[dukkha]]_ of the frustrated [[desire]] - you know, I _really_ want this thing, and I'm just frustrated I'm not making any headway, or I really want to be able to communicate well in a teaching situation or whatever, but I feel like I'm not doing well enough. So the _[[dukkha]]_ of the frustrated [[desire]] might be part of what I come into contact with when I'm kind of looking for the [[eros]] or [[desire]] underneath, underpinning or associated with this inner critic. And that's okay, because frustration also has this heat element, and it's very close to the [[desire]] and the [[eros]][[Daimon, Refracted#3 Contact the eros that's there|.]] ^14-1
###### 14-2
But again, out of that [[Vessel|crucible]], out of that, I'm directing the [[attention]] to some elements of the being, the [[eros]], the [[desire]], or even the _[[dukkha]]_ of the frustrated [[desire]] - there's heat there, and there's potential dynamism there, and out of that [[Vessel|crucible]], if I can relate to them and hold them the right way, an [[image]] might arise in relation to [[the self]], or [[the self]] might become [[image]], and one might have a very different sense of it all, even a different sense of the inner critic, a different sense of [[the self]]. There's [[healing]] there, etc[[Daimon, Refracted#There's heat and potential dynamism there|.]] ^14-2
###### 14-3
What was interesting when this person raised this with me was she was taking a public speaking course to try and develop her skills as a public speaker. They were given certain exercises and things like that. But, in this case, I don't think, or it may not be, that the underlying [[desire]], the deep longing, comes up in the context of those public speaking [exercises] - there might still be self-judgment, but the [[desire]] won't be there. But when it came to teaching or speaking in public about what she really loved, what felt really important to her, then there will be the [[desire]]. The other things were just - they were giving exercises or techniques that you can do to kind of improve as a public speaker; all really important, but it wasn't just that she wanted to be a good public speaker just for the sake of it. There were things that she wanted to communicate, that she deeply wanted to communicate and communicate well. So you have to look for the [[desire]] in the right place if this is the case[[Daimon, Refracted#Story wanting to be a good public speaker|.]] ^14-3
###### 14-4
And we'll hopefully come back to this, but there's a way - and I know some of you, probably at this point maybe most of you know this - there's a way that we, as one of the nodes, loving and being loved, we can feel loved by an [[image]] or [[Image|images]] in ways that heal so deeply. So sometimes connecting with an [[image]] and recognizing, feeling, opening to its [[love]] for us, it's so tailored and so tailored to our being and our particularities, and so attuned to us and empowered by the [[dimensionality]] and the [[divinity]] and the [[beauty]], etc., that, in a way, that kind of [[love]], the [[love]] that [[Image|images]] have for us, that profound and almost mysterious, mysteriously attuned [[love]], it can heal the inner critic and that whole painful constellation almost more powerfully, I think, than anything else[[Daimon, Refracted#The love images have for us can heal the inner critic|.]] ^14-4
###### 14-5
So if we just lay out some possibilities with regard to [[the self]] becoming [[image]], [[the self]] becoming [[imaginal]], a [[Soul|soulful]] [[The Self|sense of self]], [[soulmaking]] [[The Self|sense of self]]. There is, as I said at the beginning this evening, there is the possibility of externalizing, so to speak, [[the self]] that loves this, or [[Desire|desires]] that, or feels this way or whatever, and letting that become [[image]] - letting it become other, and then that becomes [[imaginal]]. And that starts to then echo back and change our [[The Self|sense of self]] and dimensionalize it, etc., and allow it to become more [[imaginal]], more [[soulmaking]]. Then there's also the possibility of an [[image]] that is already other, but we sense, "It's me, and it's not me. It's not me, it's other. But somehow it echoes me," and in Corbin's language, we recognize [[Daimon|the angel out ahead]]. It has something profoundly to do with me and my [[soul]]. Somehow it's profoundly me, and it's not me. So that becomes, if you like, part of our [[The Self|sense of self]], part of our [[Soul|soul-sense]] of self, part of our sense of [[soul]][[Daimon, Refracted#Recap externalizing the self; recognizing the angel out ahead|.]] ^14-5
###### 15-1
There's another possibility that I haven't really touched on, where an [[image]] can arise and it's sort of apparently impersonal. It seems like it's not to do with self, it's not an [[image]] of self. But actually it's doing something that's allowing [[the self]] to gain [[dimensionality]] and become [[image]]. So there are [[Image|images]] that are apparently impersonal, or that don't retain particularities. For example, I've been reading, in the last few years at different times, a little bit about what's called the ten _[[Sefirot]]_. It's a [[Kabbala|Kabbalistic]] teaching. They're ten - I don't know what you would call them - aspects of the Godhead, or aspects of God, or aspects of the way God emanates from the sort of [[unfabricated]], dark mystery of the innermost being of God, emanating these ten qualities (so [[love]], and strength, and [[Insight|wisdom]], etc.). And there's all kinds of literature on this, and ways it's interpreted, etc. So I was meditating one day with having read about this, and then with the idea that my being contains or expresses these ten _[[sefirot]]_, these ten aspects of God - _our_ beings do; everyone's being does[[Daimon, Refracted#The ten Sefirot - aspects of God expressed by us|.]] ^15-1
###### 15-2
So they, themselves, are part of and rooted in the divine, and are emanations, as I said, at different levels of the divine or the [[Buddha-nature]], if you prefer that word. And again, in [[Dharma]] language, _[[Dharmakaya|dharmakāya]]_ actually means the [[Embodiment|body]] of qualities of a [[Buddha]]. That was one of the original meanings of it. And it came to have other [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] of meaning. So there's a similarity there between the teaching of _[[Dharmakaya|dharmakāya]]_ and _[[Sefirot]]_. But then [it] was added to in my [[meditation]] with this idea that my being contains and expresses those ten _[[Sefirot]]_, those ten aspects of the divine, of the [[Buddha-nature]]. And meditating in that way, the _[[Sefirot]]_, they remain impersonal, but [[the self]] begins to be given a kind of [[dimensionality]] and [[divinity]], and it's complexified, etc., in that way. And because of that, [[the self]] begins to become [[imaginal]]. And then, as I said right from the beginning with the fountain basin analogy, also then the world in [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]] starts to become [[imaginal]] as [[the self]] became [[imaginal]]. Or it might be that the [[perception]] of the world is conceived of and sensed as self, that kind of [[Ways of looking|way of looking]][[Daimon, Refracted#Parallel between dharmakaya and Sefirot|.]] ^15-2
###### 15-3
So you can hear, "Well, that all sounds quite universal and impersonal, in a way. Although [[the self]] is involved, it seems to be being seen as just a universal kind of manifestation of God, of the [[Buddha-nature]], of these ten qualities that everyone has." But there was a way of doing it where my particularities were retained. I wasn't dissolving the [[The Self|sense of self]], or omitting the [[The Self|sense of self]]. My [[Stories|narrative]], my struggles, my joys, all that was included in this [[meditation]] on the [[nature]] of God and the [[nature]] of human [[psyche]], if you like, of [[Personhood|human being]] and the continuity of that in terms of the _[[Sefirot]]_, the [[Personhood|human being]] as emanation of the _[[Sefirot]],_ but without dissolving the particularities, without omitting me and my [[Stories|narrative]] and struggles and all that. So there's the particular, unique way these ten _[[Sefirot]]_ manifest and express through me. So something that can start as an apparently impersonal [[image]], or even sound like it, actually can be, by including the [[Stories|narrative]] and the particulars and the uniqueness, can be rendered more unique, retain its particularities, retain its [[personhood]] and uniqueness to self. You know, there are all kinds of possibilities; I'm just throwing out a few here[[Daimon, Refracted#My particularities were retained in the meditation not just a universal kind of manifestation of God|.]] ^15-3
###### 16-1
But if we linger for a moment with this particular area of [[Image|images]] or senses of self that are apparently impersonal, it's worth mentioning (some of you may know this): in some of the Buddhist tantras, the [[Tantra|tantric]] texts, the elements - for example, earth, air, fire, water, sometimes space, sometimes [[consciousness]], either four or five or six elements - are, we could say, personified, or associated with certain divinities, certain bodhisattvas or [[Buddha|Buddhas]] or goddesses. You could say, more than that, you could say that the elements are the refractions of those goddesses, for instance. So in the _[[Guhyasamaja Tantra|Guhyasamāja Tantra]]_, for example, there are four goddesses: [[Mamaki|Māmakī]], who is or is behind or emanates or symbolizes liquidity, the water element; [[Locana|Locanā]], who symbolizes, who represents, who emanates, who is the element of earth, of solidity; _[[Pandara|Paṇḍara]]_, who symbolizes or emanates or is the goddess of heat, fire, warmth element; and [[Tara|Tārā]], who manifests or emanates or is the goddess of air, the air element[[Daimon, Refracted#Parallel to tantra elements are refractions of the goddesses|.]] ^16-1
###### 16-2
So for some [[Tantra|tantric]] practitioners who base themselves, for example, on the _[[Guhyasamaja Tantra|Guhyasamāja Tantra]]_, practising that way, that would form part of their _maṇḍala_ and part of their [[meditation]]. There are different ways you can do this - some of it will be very prescribed, but there's no reason why one can't improvise with it a little bit. So sometimes, one may be meditating outside with a sense of the elements in relationship to one's [[Embodiment|body]], and there's a [[Soul|sensing with soul]] of, for example, the [[four elements]]. One plays with that, one encourages it, or it just opens by itself, and one senses them as divine, maybe as goddesses, personal divinities in this case, or one's following this prescribed [[image]]. So that's all lovely, and we could include that in [[Soulmaking|Soulmaking Dharma]] and that kind of thing in [[Imaginal|imaginal practice]]. There was once - maybe it was on the _[[Foundations of a Soulmaking Dharma]]_ [[retreat]]; I can't remember. I think it was in a Q & A.^[Rob Burbea, "Sailing the Oceans of Soul (Q & A)" (27 June 2018), question one, https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/51532] Someone asked me, and I responded sort of categorizing the different kinds of [[image]] that can arise. There are the [[imaginal]] [[Image|images]] in the way that we talk about them for the most part, but then there are other variations where you can kind of get this formless space that retains the essence of the [[The Self|particularity]], of the character, of whatever [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]] one was meditating on, but the actual sensible apprehension of that [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]] has gone, and it just retains their character - an empty space with their character. It can be very beautiful, very profound. That's a possibility[[Daimon, Refracted#Meditating with the four elements sense them as divine|.]] ^16-2
###### 16-3
There's also a whole possibility - what often tends to happen with more prescribed [[Image|images]] or archetypes, [[Avalokiteshvara|Kuan Yin]] or these four goddesses from the _Guhyasamāja_, for instance, or [[Tara|Tārā]], where it's almost like one's working with an [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]], but that [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]] is kind of, in a way, semi-universal. And that's fine. That's a very popular form of practice, of using the imagination or visualization, especially for [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] practitioners. And it can stay there - like this goddess, [[Tara|Tārā]] or whoever it is, doesn't really become a fully particularized character the way [[imaginal]] [[Image|images]], in the sense that we _mostly_ are talking about them, tend to. But it's still really valid and can be really fruitful. And of course, an [[image]] may start that way, in a sort of more universal [[Archetype|archetypal]] sense of this [[image]], [[Tara|Tārā]] or this goddess or whatever it is, and then become more particularized with practice - not that it should or shouldn't; it's just a slightly different realm that one's in, a slightly different direction[[Daimon, Refracted#The more prescribed images and archetype are semi-universal but can become particularized with practice|.]] ^16-3
###### 16-4
Or, again, it could be, for instance, in practising, let's say, sensing the elements with [[soul]], the [[four elements]] (earth, air, fire, water), and letting them become divinities, goddesses like that, again, then as one meditates it may be, and one might be able to steer it this way or it might just happen this way (it's not better or worse), that they become particularized, these goddesses, or their relationship with _this_ [[Embodiment|body]], _this_ self, and the elements in relation to these more universal archetypes, that relationship relates to this [[The Self|particular self]]. And again, as we said in the example of practising with the ten _[[Sefirot]]_, the particulars of _this_ self, and _this_ [[Embodiment|body]], and the way the elements _have_ manifested in this [[Embodiment|body]] and in this life and in this [[Stories|narrative]], and _do_ manifest right now and will in the future, _that's_ where the [[The Self|particularity]] is not just retained but also then involved and - what's the word? - highlighted and amplified, even, in the practice. So they remain somewhat universal, the elements and the goddesses behind them, in this example, but it starts to become more personal through the relationship, how do those elements, how have they been incorporated into my life, _this_ life, _this_ [[Stories|narrative]], _this_ being, _this_ self, _this_ [[Embodiment|body]]. Yes? So that's a possibility. Actually, there are a couple of possibilities there - letting it be more universal and [[Archetype|archetypal]], and it becoming less so through the particularization, the uniqueness of [[the self]], or through the gradual particularization and uniqueness of these divine figures, they become more particular, more like proper characters[[Daimon, Refracted#They can become more personal through how they have been incorporated into my life|.]] ^16-4
###### 17-1
So you can see there are all kinds of tributaries of possibilities here in this. But even if something starts apparently impersonal - I mean, it can _stay_ impersonal and still be very [[soulmaking]], very beautiful, very fruitful kinds of practice, _or_ there are ways that it can be apparently impersonal and then gain more relevance to the personal self and [[The Self|particularity]], either in oneself or in the [[image]]. So just throwing out some different possibilities here. We're talking about what can support the [[The Self|sense of self]] becoming [[imaginal]], and the sense of then dimensionalizing [[the self]] and sensing [[the self]] as having divine roots, as being [[Divinity|theophany]], etc., as having its origins in other [[Dimensionality|dimensions]]. I mentioned several times now ways of practising where one has a kind of panoramic view or bird's-eye view of the whole of one's life, as if from the other side of [[death]], beyond [[death]], [[Death|after death]], so to speak - seeing, almost all at once, as a tableau, the [[birth]], the life, the [[Stories|narrative]], and the [[death]], sort of from the perspective of eternity. And one can just play with that. It may take a little practice, but it's just using the imagination a certain way[[Daimon, Refracted#Seeing everything from a bird's-eye view from the perspective of eternality|.]] ^17-1
###### 17-2
In gaining that perspective on life, then, it can be that the [[eternality]] element, the node of [[eternality]], is triggered, is ignited, and that can then allow the sensing of one's life - of one's [[birth]], [[Stories|narrative]], and [[death]] - from this perspective, from the eternal perspective, if you like, and the whole thing can be sensed with [[soul]]. It starts to flesh out and come alive, [[Soul|ensouled]] - one sees it, one senses oneself, one's life, one's journey, all of it with [[soul]]. So I've mentioned that a couple of times, but actually there's all kinds of possibility when we get into the domain of time and [[Unfabricated|timelessness]], and [[Perception|perceptions]] of time and [[eternality]], etc. I don't know if you've ever experienced this, but sometimes in your [[love]] for someone - a human other, or beloved other, maybe an animal, even, or a tree or something - where there's [[love]], sometimes it's possible, because of the [[love]] and because of the [[eros]], that the [[perception]], of course, becomes [[soulmaking]]. You actually sense them with [[soul]] at times, this beloved other. And sometimes it's a possible, I find very lovely [[perception]], to perceive this other, this beloved other, or oneself, even, as the sort of contemporaneous totality of the temporal slices of their life[[Daimon, Refracted#Triggered eternality node|.]] ^17-2
###### 17-3
In other words, one can see plainly, they are with them, and it's now, and they are X years old, whatever that is, but somehow I'm seeing not just that, but I'm seeing them when they were a little girl, I'm seeing them when they were a baby, I'm seeing them when they were a teenager, I'm seeing them in the full bloom of adulthood, I'm seeing them when they're an old person, I'm seeing them when they're very old, etc., and all those kind of temporal slices exist at once, all those ages, and one loves them all, and one perceives them all at once in the being. Again, in the [[Soul|sensing with soul]], through the [[eros]] inseminating [[psyche]] and [[logos]], inseminating the [[imaginal]] object, the beloved other, and it complexifies, it diversifies, it presents other faces, more and more faces, more and more [[Dimensionality|dimensions]]. So that's one very lovely way of perceiving either oneself at times or someone you [[love]]. All kinds of possibilities, though, when we get into the realm of time and the [[perception]] of time[[Daimon, Refracted#Seeing all temporal slices of the beloved other at once|.]] ^17-3
###### 18-1
Another possibility - and last one for now, but - another possibility is meditating on an aspect of your being. So it could be the [[Embodiment|body]], or anything, it could be the voice, etc., and meditating on it in a way, sensing it in a way that allows it to become [[Soul|ensouled]], allows it to gain [[Dimensionality|dimensions]] and significance for [[soul]] and the elements to come alive with respect to that aspect or area or domain of our being. And then, maybe from there, then it spreads to the whole [[The Self|sense of self]]. So, could give an example of this, but might even try it as a [[Meditation|guided meditation]], if you feel like, right now, just very briefly, to give you a sense of what the kind of possibilities are[[Daimon, Refracted#Meditating on an aspect of your being and sensing it in a way to become ensouled|.]] ^18-1
###### 18-2
(1:45:24, [[Meditation|guided meditation]] begins) ^18-2
###### 18-3
So if you're listening and you want to engage, put your [[Embodiment|body]] into a posture that's comfortable and sort of appropriate for [[meditation]] or helpful for [[meditation]], whether it's standing or sitting upright or whatever it is. And just take some moments to actually sense the [[Embodiment|body]], just in the simple way of sensation, etc., and the [[energy body]], and expand that [[awareness]] of the [[energy body]][[Daimon, Refracted#Posture sense the body expand the energy body|.]] ^18-3
###### 18-4
But include in your [[awareness]], as we've touched on - it's not that this always has to be the case, but for right now, let the [[The Self|sense of self]], which includes your [[Stories|narrative]], narrative_s_, let that be there too. That doesn't mean getting lost in it. It doesn't mean going off on a distracted tangent or fretting about this or that. It just means having a [[Embodiment|sense of body]], how the [[Embodiment|body]] feels, how the [[energy body]] feels, its presence right now, its material presence, its energetic presence and feel, but also of your self. There's a self sitting here, so to speak, and that self has a [[Stories|narrative]], and that kind of can be included, so to speak, in the larger scope or background of the [[awareness]][[Daimon, Refracted#Let the sense of self including your narratives be there too|.]] ^18-4
###### 18-5
And just gently, very gently, suffuse your [[Embodiment|body]], your self, your [[Stories|narrative]] with _[[Metta|mettā]]_, with [[Metta|loving-kindness]], with unconditional well-wishing. Every part and aspect of your [[Embodiment|body]], as the [[Buddha]] would say, leaving no spot untouched. Just totally permeating and saturating your [[Embodiment|body]] with the [[healing]] balm of friendliness, of [[Metta|kindness]], of [[love]], and well-wishing. And let that _[[Metta|mettā]]_ include your self and your [[Stories|narrative]], narratives. Very gentle, very light touch here. Aware of the [[Embodiment|body]], aware of the [[energy]] of the [[Embodiment|body]], aware of the [[energy]] of the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ touching the [[Embodiment|body]], permeating the [[Embodiment|body]], surrounding and suffusing the [[Embodiment|body]][[Daimon, Refracted#Suffuse your body your self you narrative with metta|.]] ^18-5
###### 18-6
Then you can let the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ be somewhat there as a sort of implicit background or basis of this short [[Meditation|guided meditation]]. So let that kind of go into the background, but still be there, underpinning everything. And aware of the [[Embodiment|body]], again, aware of certainly the energetic feel of the [[energy body]], but also aware of the [[Materialism|materiality]] of the [[Embodiment|body]], the physicality of it - sinews, muscles, nerves, fibres, skin. Your [[Embodiment|body]]. Yes, it's not yours, but let's say it's yours right now, it's you. It's not you, and it's you[[Daimon, Refracted#Metta in the background but still be there; being aware of the physicality of the body|.]] ^18-6
###### 18-7
Just checking that the _[[Metta|mettā]]_ is still there sort of implicitly in the background, warmth, [[Metta|kindness]], well-wishing. If that needs a little boosting, just give it a gentle shot. But seeing if you can dwell with the [[Embodiment|sense of body]], the mystery of [[embodiment]] - _your_ [[embodiment]]. The mystery of you having this particular [[Perception|appearance]], this kind of form, this kind of [[Embodiment|body]]. The miracle of that, the gift of that. And yes, all its particular quirks, and all its particular ways it doesn't work so well, may be failing in this way or that. It's still an amazing thing. It's a beautiful [[Embodiment|body]]. Totally a miracle. And there's no other [[Embodiment|body]] like it. And it's tied in to your being, your [[soul]][[Daimon, Refracted#Dwell with the mystery of your embodiment|.]] ^18-7
###### 19-1
And then, within the scope of the [[Embodiment|body]] and the bodily functions, let's just focus in on the voice. So as far as the [[Embodiment|body]] is concerned, we can kind of identify maybe three or four regions or centres of voice production in the [[Embodiment|body]], that are involved in vocalizing, in making sound. So there's the chest. The air in the lungs, and the whole resonant cavity of the chest. So just to be aware of that. It's part of the instrument, part of the miracle, part of what allows you to sing forth, sound forth, communicate, reach out to touch other people through your voice, to express your uniqueness, your point of view. Let yourself be aware of your chest, in the context of the gift of voice, the mystery of voice[[Daimon, Refracted#Focus on the voice i e centres of voice production in the body|.]] ^19-1
###### 19-2
And there's the throat and the voice box or the larynx. Also obviously integral to the production of sound, our voicing in the world. A part of the gift. And the mouth, the malleable cavity of the mouth - can shape itself as a resonant chamber to, in all kinds of ways, all kinds of amazingly precise ways, to really shape sound very precisely, very uniquely. Then there's the tongue and the teeth, which are also included in the instrument, part of what allows, shapes, and supports, forms the voice, the sounding. So this miracle, this gift of [[embodiment]], and part of that miracle, that gift of [[embodiment]], is this particular set of areas, regions, centres of the [[Embodiment|body]] that are involved in vocalization, in voice[[Daimon, Refracted#Larynx mouth tongue teeth|.]] ^19-2
###### 19-3
And as you're with your [[Embodiment|sense of the body]] and with the sense of these four areas or regions or centres of voice production in the [[Embodiment|body]], beginning to include in the [[awareness]], in your meditative [[awareness]], what comes through the voice, what _can_ come through - what comes through of [[soul]], through the voice, through _your_ voice, through _our_ voices? What comes through as [[soul]] through these regions, these centres of the [[Embodiment|body]]? [[Metta|Kindness]] can come through. [[Love]] can come through. Humour, the mystery of humour. Flashes of intelligence and brilliance come through, are articulated. All these aspects of [[soul]], _your_ [[soul]], coming through, being given life, manifestation, [[embodiment]], through the voice, through this physical entity, through this miracle of [[Embodiment|body]]. _Your_ perspective, the way _you_ see things, the way _you_ sense things[[Daimon, Refracted#What comes through of soul through your voice kindness love humour intelligence|.]] ^19-3
###### 19-4
Fire can come through. Fire in the voice, fire in the perspective, fire in what's articulated. Struggle, story - we can convey [[Stories|our story]], our struggles, our difficulties, our pains, the sensitivity of our heart. All that manifests from and through these regions of the [[Embodiment|body]], the chest, the throat, the voice box, the mouth, the tongue and teeth. [[Poetry]] can come through - either literal [[poetry]], or just poetic speech. One level, we can say [[Embodiment|body]] is [[soul]], or we don't divide them - we can say [[Embodiment|body]] is the instrument of [[soul]], the gift of [[Embodiment|body]] in the service of the gift of [[soul]], to you and from you, into the world and to other souls. In the voice, there's obviously the possibility of carrying verbal communication. We communicate ideas and [[feelings]] and requests and all kinds of things, as I elucidated. There's also the sound itself, the [[music]] of speech. So often when we listen to someone speak or we speak ourselves, we're concentrating on the words and their meaning. But there's also the parallel, intertwined, ongoing [[music]] - the sounds, the syllables, the mystery of that. Somehow, this, too, is part of the communication of [[soul]]. Of course it's there when we sing, etc., but it's there when we speak. This [[music]], right now, as I'm speaking. Can listen to the words, the meaning: "What's he talking about? Oh, I'm trying to follow these instructions." But there's also a [[music]] in the sounds of the spoken voice. And it doesn't necessarily _mean_ anything; it's [[music]], and it has [[dimensionality]], and it has mystery, if we can hear it in a certain way. It has [[beauty]][[Daimon, Refracted#Fire struggles poetry - the gift of body in the service of the gift of soul|.]] ^19-4
###### 20-1
All this comes through you, comes through the gift of [[Embodiment|body]], is [[Embodiment|embodied]] through [[Embodiment|body]]. And what happens right now if you just experiment in this meditative state, in this [[soul]]-sensitivity, as much as you can encourage it gently right now, with the full [[awareness]] and the sensitivity of the resonances and the ripples in the heart, in the [[soul]], in the [[energy body]], perhaps even in [[image]]? You just let yourself make certain sounds that are not words. Maybe certain syllables. [_makes "pah" sound_] And listen to the mystery of it. You are part of that mystery. Listen to the [[music]] of it. It doesn't _mean_ anything, but it's full of meaning_fulness_. The mystery of this ability to vocalize. Doesn't matter what sound right now, what syllable. [_"ssssss", "ah," "tuh," scatting sounds, "ahh," "dsk"_] If you want to, you can press pause and, for a few minutes, just play with that. Let yourself vocalize meaningless or apparently meaningless sounds, and hear it as [[music]], sense the mystery there. It can be in the vocalization, in the sound, in the rhythm if you string syllables together. There's [[music]] there[[Daimon, Refracted#Practice Make certain sounds that are not words and sense the mysteriy there|.]] ^20-1
###### 20-2
What happens now if you say "I"? I. This time with the implication of the meaning of "I," [[the self]], the mystery of that. I. What happens when you vocalize that "I"? What happens when you vocalize "you"? So really as delicately sensitive and open and alive to anything that you notice, anything in the nuance of reverberation, of resonance, of mystery, of [[beauty]][[Daimon, Refracted#What happens now if you say "I" "you"|.]] ^20-2

Maybe that gives you an idea. As I was saying, you could take any area or aspect of the being - voice we did, could be [[Embodiment|body]] or whatever - and meditate on it in a way that supports or opens the possibility of sensing that domain of your being with [[soul]], and from there it can spread to [[the self]] and perhaps even in [[Cosmology|cosmopoesis]], etc. So like I said, these are just some possibilities. The possibilities are infinite, really, for the ways that [[the self]] can become [[imaginal]] and gain that [[dimensionality]] and [[divinity]] and all that in our sense of it. Really, we might turn it around and say, what actually gets _in the way_ of that happening? What prevents us sensing [[the self]] with [[soul]]? One is, of course, as usual, a [[logos]], an idea, a conception that disallows it. So, for example, the example I gave earlier, this wanting to make an imprint or this wanting to make an impression - I just assume that it's ego and it's not okay, and I judge it. There's a [[logos]] there that's actually limiting my sense of things and my [[Insight|understanding]] of myself and my impulses and the movements of my being. So very often, a certain [[logos]] gets in the way, and we don't even realize it[[Daimon, Refracted#1 a logos that disallows it|.]] ^20-5

Or, as I said I think at the beginning of the talk, you know, not noticing the possibility that in working with an [[imaginal]] other, or an [[imaginal]] object, that [[the self]], too, can become infected, caught up, involved in the [[soulmaking dynamic]], [[the self]]-sense can become [[imaginal]]. Either not noticing it or not allowing it for whatever reasons. Maybe I don't even know the reason; it just feels it's blocked. So that's going to get in the way, obviously. Of course, the opposite can be true, as I touched on. It could be just it's always my self that's [[imaginal]], and I fail to allow the world or others to become [[imaginal]], to sense them with [[soul]]. That's also a possibility and it will be a problem[[Daimon, Refracted#2 not noticing that the self or other or world too can be involved in the soulmaking dynamic|.]] ^20-6

What else gets in the way? Over-identification, over-reification of the [[The Self|sense of self]], any [[The Self|sense of self]], even if it's a beautiful one. It feels like, "Oh, this is what we're talking about now, this is [[imaginal]]." If it's too reified, problem. If I'm too identified with it, problem. It will squeeze the [[soul]] out of it, like squeezing the juice out. Or, on the other hand, I just dismiss it: "Oh, that's crazy. That's stupid. That's not real." Over-reification or under-reification, in a way. Like I've said, I think a couple of times, we're dancing on the breadth of this boulevard of the [[imaginal]] [[Middle Way]] with respect to reification, how much, how little at different times. And sometimes, or with some people at some times, it's important that they view or that they are encouraged to view: "Do you realize you're more _really_ that, you're more _really_ or more _primarily_ [[Daimon|angel]] than you are what you appear to be in the conventional sense, in the conventional view?[[Daimon, Refracted#3 over- or under-reification of the sense of self|"]] ^21-1

Sometimes, of course, a person's gone the other way, and they've identified _too_ much with that angelic dimension or the [[imaginal]] self, need a bit less reification sometimes. But, you know, [[Dominant culture|our culture]] doesn't really support that view of the [[dimensionality]] of the [[Personhood|human being]] in our sense of the [[imaginal]] self, of the angelic refraction. So because the culture doesn't, we might need to lean on it a bit more, to relegitimize it, reinstate it and open up that possibility. But it's also very individual, and it can vary at different times and different situations. But there is the possibility of sensing [[the self]] with [[soul]], sensing [[the self]] as a temporal emanation of what is timeless, the [[Daimon|angel]], a [[Divinity|theophany]]. We hold it lightly, and in that light holding of it, as I said, it can have enormous power, bear enormous fruit, something very, very beautiful[[Daimon, Refracted#Our culture doesn't really support that view of the dimensionality of the human being|.]] ^21-2
