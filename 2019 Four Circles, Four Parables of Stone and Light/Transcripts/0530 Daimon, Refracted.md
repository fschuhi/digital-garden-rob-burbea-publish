###### 1-1
If one's practice and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, or _śūnyatā_, goes deep enough and wide enough, radical and thorough enough, then we see - amongst other things, we see that any view or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> is empty. Any self-concept is empty of inherent existence. It is not an ultimate or basic truth. So in that fuller and more radical <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, it is _not_ the case, for example, that the personality is somehow illusory but what's _really_ the case or what really constitutes <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> is just the process in time of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">five aggregates</a></span>, of physical <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Materialism" data-href="Materialism" class="internal-link">materiality</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span>, thoughts, intentions, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, etc. It's not the case, either, if one goes that deeply into <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span>, that self is an illusion but some kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> is a basic reality, etc. All these views, all views of self are seen to be empty. And where that leaves a practitioner who has seen that, who has understood that, is not, rather, with a sort of impossibility of using the language of self, or using the views of self, and a sort of "nowhere to go" situation in their life, predicament in their life regarding self (and anything else, in fact, because everything is empty), but rather, because _everything_ is empty, and there is no sort of hidden, basic, building block reality or fundament that is not empty, where it leaves a person, seeing that, is it opens up any and all views of self as kind of legitimate views and concepts to play with, to entertain, to put on the way an actor would put on different costumes, etc. - although that analogy quickly breaks down if you think about it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > All views of the self are empty which legitimizes playing with them" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#All views of the self are empty which legitimizes playing with them" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-1
###### 1-2
So through deep <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, there's the legitimization to see and conceive and perceive self in different ways at different times in the whole range of views of self. So yes, sure, I can practise at times seeing or conceiving of personality being empty, ego being empty, but all there is is this process of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a></span> in time, for instance. Yes, fine. Legitimate view. Very helpful, quite freeing, quite simplifying at times, to a certain level helpful. Or a view of just cosmic <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span> of one kind or another, and again the ego or the separate self is an illusion. Yes, beautiful, lovely, liberating to a certain extent at times, etc. And many others. But it also legitimizes seeing/sensing oneself as <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> of another as <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, as <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">theophany</a></span>, as having a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="duty" class="internal-link">duty</a></span> to one's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">daimons</a></span> (which we can actually use interchangeably with '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>,' for now at least)<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Possibilities self as process oneness angel" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Possibilities self as process oneness angel" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2
###### 1-3
So the deep <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> seeing, the radicality, the thoroughness, the totality of that legitimizes, opens up all kinds of possibilities - in a way, an infinite range of possibilities - rather than closing down all these possibilities. We're free, free to conceive and perceive and talk and entertain senses, any <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>. We're free, free to move in that whole range, knowing all the time that whichever costume one puts on, whichever way of conceiving, sensing, viewing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> is empty, as empty as any other. And we said already in one of the talks - I can't remember already, but one of the talks in this series^[Rob Burbea, "'Until All is Liquid' (Emptiness and Sensing with Soul)" (29 May 2019), https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/58786] - that when we talk about not just the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, what <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nagarjuna" data-href="Nagarjuna" class="internal-link">Nāgārjuna</a></span> calls the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span>, and others, has come down the tradition as the sort of secondary meaning of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span>, of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span> - but when we talk about the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span>, we're not talking about simply a dissolution, a melting of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, a dissolving, a disappearing, a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a></span> of self or other objects of the imagination. To be an object of the imagination, it must be formed in some way. It must retain some degree of form, this form or that form. And again, there's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Infinity" data-href="Infinity" class="internal-link">the infinite</a></span> range there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > We are free to entertain any sense of self" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#We are free to entertain any sense of self" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3

So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span>, it's formed, but it's theatre. And again, as I said in the past, if you've been to good theatre, it's powerful. You know this is not real, what's happening in front of you, but it affects you, and it can effect a transformation in your being, a transformation in your life, in your heart, in your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, in your view of things, in your aspirations, in your <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span>, etc. So yes, theatre; theatre needs forms. But knowing they're theatre doesn't take anything away from the power that these different, let's say, forms of self, the different senses of self, can wield<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Its formed but its theatre" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#It's formed but it's theatre" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1
###### 2-2
We also mentioned already in a talk that there's this kind of dance across the range of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span>. So the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span> might seem <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">neither real nor not real</a></span>. It can seem, just like the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span>, like a very narrow path, that it's a kind of razor's edge of precision in terms of reification and non-reification, etc. But actually, there may be - I think it's helpful to conceive of rather this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span> is kind of more of a broad boulevard, and so we have this possibility to reify less at times or more at times, across that range that still constitutes basically a sense of theatre with regard to an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> or a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span>. We'll come back to that, hopefully, in this talk<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > The imaginal Middle Way is more a boulevard" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#The imaginal Middle Way is more a boulevard" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
I think in the last <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> that we did at <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a></span>, the _Roots into the Ground of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a></span>_, I tried to give an analogy, a metaphor for the necessity, if you like, for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal sense</a></span> beginning to involve and enliven and dimensionalize, etc., the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>. So that oftentimes we talk about an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> as other - the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> feels like it's other. Not always, of course; we've touched on that. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> is other - it's an object. But it's important, in time [for the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> to become <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>]. It might not happen immediately with a certain <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, and again, back to the questions of pacing, etc. And with some <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>, or some experiences <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span>, etc., it doesn't always need, it's not always important that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> becomes <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. It might be just fine for this other to be <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> and the sense of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> doesn't spread to involve <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> sometimes. But if one looks, over time, at one's sort of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">tendencies</a></span> or patterns with regard to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span>, and one notices that, for instance, "Oh, it's the _other_ that's always divine, and I don't tend to sense my own <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>, because the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> has not become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>," if one senses, if one recognizes, looking back over a stretch of time with many <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> and one sees, "Oh, that's really quite rare," then one might be recognizing there an imbalance<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Imbalance between sensing the other and sensing self as imaginal" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Imbalance between sensing the other and sensing self as imaginal" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
I gave this analogy, as I was saying, on the last <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, of a fountain. You can imagine like a fountain, a stone fountain in one of those squares, in a city or a village, in a piazza or whatever it is. If you imagine this fountain, the water shoots up out of the sort of central nozzle, and we could say, in this analogy, that's kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>'s creations and discoveries rising up from the central nozzle, this sort of infinite and endless outpouring of the inclination to make <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> to make <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, and the raw material of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. So the water comes up out of the central nozzle, and then, as it does with fountains, it falls back down. And that central nozzle is central in a stone tray, maybe a circular stone tray. In falling back down, if the water just falls back down on one side of the fountain and not around the whole area, around all the different sides of that circle, then if the stone's not too heavy and there's a lot of water - again, analogies get stretched, but - if it just falls on one side, that basin and the whole fountain is going to tip over. It's going to be made lopsided and eventually kind of lose its balance, fall, and maybe shatter, if it's lopsided<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Simile stone fountain" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Simile stone fountain" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 3-1
If the water is falling down _equally_, or relatively equally over the different areas of the circumference of this circular basin, then there's more balance there. I've put this out there a few times now, but really stressing its importance: <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> wants self, other, and world to become <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. So where there's, let's say, an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> that's an other, feels like an erotic object that maybe I'm sensing it as divine, etc., there's a natural tendency - and again, it might have its own, let's say, natural pace, if we can even use such terms - for the sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, also, and then the world in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a></span>, to also become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. So the initial <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> might have been an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of another, and working with that, if we don't get in the way, if we allow <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> to do what it wants to do (which is to make more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>), then self and world, as well as this other, will become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. I hope that makes sense. Without that, as I said, there will be a tipping over. So there will be, for instance, very little <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> if just this other is divine but I'm not, especially if that other is a human other whose <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span> I am sensing because I am sensing them with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, and _I_ am not - I remain flat or lacking in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Soul wants self other and world to become image" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Soul wants self other and world to become image" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
When we talk about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self, other, world</a></span> becoming <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> wanting self, other, and world to become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, all, then we also have to point out: it doesn't have to happen in any order. I have been sometimes sitting, for instance, teaching a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and the yogis, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sangha" data-href="Sangha" class="internal-link">Saṅgha</a></span>, become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> for me first, and then it might spread to the world, and to me, include the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal sense</a></span> - <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> gets subsumed, involved, kneaded into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> and the creativity and discovery of that. So it can happen in any order. It might start with a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a></span>. It might start from some lovely sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> opening up, some <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal sense</a></span>, some <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span>, either of one object or of the totality of one's environment, and _then_ move to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>. So any order is possible. But over the long-term, we want to get a sense that the waters of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> are allowed to flow all ways, all those three ways - <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self, other, world</a></span>. The order is not important<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Any order is possible" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Any order is possible" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
So that's something to check, and what I really want to talk about tonight is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> becoming <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. So that's a general point in terms of contextualizing it. We could go further with that and actually <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Delineations" data-href="Delineations" class="internal-link">delineate</a></span> other aspects of being, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, that also will tend to become <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">ensouled</a></span> if we let the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span> and process do its thing, if we don't get in the way, or block it, or inhibit it in some way. So we could say also that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> will become dimensionalized, divinized. Our own <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> will become an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">erotic-imaginal object</a></span> for us. And in fact, any aspect of our being that sort of comes into the orbit of our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> will, when the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> is happening, at a certain point, it will get drawn into the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span> and hence become <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>. So <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self, other, world</a></span>, other aspects too. But it's important that self also becomes <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> at some point, or sometimes, at least, and that can happen in any order<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Any aspect of our being can be drawn into the soulmaking dynamic" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Any aspect of our being can be drawn into the soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3

In a way, like I said, we could say this is just what <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> will naturally do, left to its own devices, if it isn't blocked. But still, we can investigate that whole movement a little bit more, and at times we can encourage or help it, and that's quite interesting, to explore that. So I think I already mentioned but I didn't really fill it out, you know, sometimes what happens is we're dealing with something that's touching the heart, and maybe touching the heart in a difficult way, whatever this issue is, or a very lovely way, but we see that we <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> something. Maybe that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> is already <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>. Maybe it's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. Maybe it's a painful kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, or it's stuck in a painful place. One possibility sometimes - again, being quite deft in the touch here, and delicate in the sort of manoeuvring, rather than formulaic and yanking things around - but one possibility then is to almost like externalize <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> who loves this or that, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> who has <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> for this or that, or has <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> for this or that. So one's feeling it in oneself, and even getting to that point, it might be that _that_ was a journey, even to recognize, "Oh, I have <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> for this," or "Wrapped up in this complicated _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ that I feel afflicted by right now or lost in, actually as part of the whole constellation of _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, there is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>." There will always be <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> when there's _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_, and that goes back to the teaching of the OCD practice, the Opening to the Current of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">Desire</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Externalizing the self who loves this or that" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Externalizing the self who loves this or that" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-4

But often there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> too: I <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> this or that. It's wrapped up with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, of course: I <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> this or that, I have <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> for this or that, I have <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> for this or that. But externalizing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>. So here's all this complex _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_; I recognize that one strand of it is my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> for this or that, or my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> for this or that. And 'externalizing' it means let the one who loves this or that, the one who <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span> this or that, let that become <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. She/he/they <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> this or that. So almost putting it in the third person and letting it constellate as an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, which then obviously has echoing and mirroring and kind of maybe feels a bit like myself but is also other. Sometimes that's a really skilful move - again, if it's deftly and delicately done, and handled without too much pressure, or clunkiness, or demand, or formulaic sort of going through the motions<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Let that he she they become image" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Let that he she they become image" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-1
###### 4-2
She/he/they who <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> this or that, she/he/they who <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> or have <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> for this or that, and then, being with that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, it might be that one actually recognizes, "Oh," one has <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> for, there's an erotic relationship with that self that we've just externalized. So let it be other, but it becomes <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>. It might start as just a sort of more flat <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, but as one recognizes the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, as one recognizes the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> there, it might become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. And sometimes it's easier to have that sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> when it's externalized like that. We have all kinds of reasons and social taboos and cultural conditionings and whatnot, and contractions of being, and psychology - it's harder to have that, to recognize the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span>, and to have an erotic relationship with oneself. So one kind of externalizes it by just making it <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. Don't worry if it's not <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> at first. It can very soon _become_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, more fully <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, with the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Sometimes its easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when its externalized like that" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Sometimes it's easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it's externalized like that" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-2

So the one who <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span> and loves opening, the one who <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span> and loves to be touched, that becomes an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, and one sees, as I said, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eternality" class="internal-link">eternality</a></span>. There's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> there. There's reverence. And one recognizes the echoing, the mirroring: it's me, and it's not me. But that might have come, this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal sense</a></span> of the one who <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span> and loves opening, the one who <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span> and loves to be touched, or as someone else said, "the one who is faithful and devoted to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>." All these - these are actual examples from interviews, but they came out of something, they came out of a condition of being that wasn't at all clear to start with; it was just a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">contracted</a></span> sort of tangle of lots of different painful elements, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span>, and psychology, and situation, and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a></span>, etc. But as this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> was supported to come to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="birth" class="internal-link">birth</a></span> and to emerge there, then it reflects back on <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>. In <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Infinity" data-href="Infinity" class="internal-link">the infinite</a></span> echoing and mirroring, one recognizes something. One recognizes something about oneself, and oneself has become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, in a sense, although there's this kind of _other_, it's _other_. It doesn't matter. Some magic, some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="alchemy" class="internal-link">alchemy</a></span> has happened in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>. So it might take a little while to get there, because one has to kind of deal with the tangle of _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ sometimes, or it might not be that tangled, it might not even be _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ to start with. But then these steps, if you like - I don't want to make it too formulaic - then the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> is revealed, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> is revealed, the whole self-sense can open up<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Examples from interviews" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Examples from interviews" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-3

So this is important, and there are so many possibilities, working with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, of the way <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> gets pulled into the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span>, pulled into the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal sense</a></span>, how the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal sense</a></span> spreads to include <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>. Someone <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span> at <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a></span> was sharing with me - this was a while ago - they were in the garden, and a blackbird flew into a window of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a></span> and was wounded, fell to the ground and was wounded. And she heard the sound, saw it, found the blackbird in the sort of undergrowth, in the flowerbed or something. It was clearly wounded, and so she just sat with it, and she stayed with it in its wounded condition, in its <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and stayed there with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, with care, with concern, but also with a troubled heart. There was quite a lot of _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_ at first with that situation. Despite the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, etc., there was, "What should I do?", and the being was stirred up, partly in a not very helpful way. But then, as she sat with it, or later, actually, the whole thing became <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, became <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>. The whole scene, and the blackbird, and the wounding there became <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, and in our framework, we say when something becomes more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> a lot of the unhelpful <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">complication</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">proliferation</a></span> that we call _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_ diminishes. So as the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> grows, the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_ diminishes. As the _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_ grows, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> diminishes<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Story wounded blackbird" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Story wounded blackbird" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1

So somehow in being with it, and being with it later back in her room, the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>_ declined, peace came, and a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> sense came, something that was <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. She went back in the morning to check on the blackbird, but it was dead. Well, actually it was gone, so either it was presumed dead or a fox got it or something. The next day, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> returned. She was reporting this in an interview, and I asked her, in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, is the bird alone, or are you in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, sitting with it? And she said actually the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> was of her sitting with the bird, rather than the bird alone. Both would have been fine; it was more I just wanted to get a sense of what the actual <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> was, what it included, and what the possibilities were. But there was something, I think - a particular possibility or direction gets included if she was in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. It's not better or worse. It's just a particular possibility, a direction, gets included when the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> is the wounded bird _and_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > The image included Blackbird _and_ the self" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#The image included Blackbird _and_ the self" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2
###### 5-3
Sometimes, in a kind of simple way this works, it's almost like then implicit in that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> - I didn't actually linger on it; I kind of, I think, said very little, because I wanted to let the process work by itself, without me leading it or suggesting it too much, suggesting too much a direction or what needed to happen. But one of the sort of basic possibilities of working with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> in this way is that sometimes we don't see things about ourselves, and sometimes some aspect or quality of our being comes more clearly to be recognized. But it's not just that. There's more to it than that. So in this case, her natural goodness - deep, natural, almost innocent, almost childlike care for beings, something that, my sense, was very natural to her <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. It's part of her <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. So we recognize something, recognize our own positive qualities, etc. But there's more to it than that, because the whole thing can then become dimensionalized and divinized, which is different than just recognizing, "Oh, I'm good at this, and I have that quality," and that sort of flatly conceived psychology of self-esteem or whatever. That may be one level, but then there's the possibility, when things become <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span>, with the theatre, with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eternality" class="internal-link">eternality</a></span>, with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">theophany</a></span>, etc., that it can become more than that. Still, that basic level of recognizing certain qualities of oneself, really, through an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, is important. As I said, sometimes it's easier when it's external, externalized like that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > It is and it is more than I have this quality" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#It is and it is more than I have this quality" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-3
###### 5-4
We'll give a couple more examples. Someone a while ago came into an interview and reported two <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>, and was actually interested how to connect the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> and with the particularities of herself, etc. So one <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> was a kind of dramatic <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of a queen with a long robe, and the robe was trailing blood. So she's leaving this trail of blood from her long robe. I have it written down somewhere - I can't find it. Yeah, anyway. So that was the main part of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. Who is this queen? What's her story? I can't remember if _I_ asked that; I think I did, or she might have wondered, or she might have just offered the background story. And she was concerned, in offering this background story that, "Oh, but I thought <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> were not supposed to be <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">narrative</a></span>." We touched on this, I think, in a Q & A in the _Roots into the Ground of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a></span>_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>.^[Rob Burbea, "On Practising with Images (Q & A)" (26 March 2019), question six, https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/58613] Sometimes you get an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> which is not so much a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">narrative</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> as much as it has a kind of backstory. It has a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> background. So one understands, almost actually implicitly - not like watching a series of events, but one understands implicitly the story or the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">narrative</a></span>, in this case, of this queen, or whatever the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> character is<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Image Queen trailing blood" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Image Queen trailing blood" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-4
###### 6-1
So in a way, it's part of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>; it's just more in the background and intuited implicitly, but it has a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">narrative</a></span> structure, and still the whole retains a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eternality" class="internal-link">eternality</a></span>, of 'always already happening,' of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">timelessness</a></span>, etc. So that's actually not a problem with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>. And even if they're <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">narrative</a></span>, sometimes it's not a problem, but let's just say that for now. And getting a sense of this queen trailing blood, and her poise and strength. I can't remember - I think, again, it's almost like I might have had to ask questions to tease out the character, and the quality, and maybe a bit of the backstory of this queen. As she was sharing this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> became alive for me, so we were entering into it together, and I felt like I was perceiving the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> just as much as she was. It became, in a way, a common object between us, which is a very lovely thing to happen, as many of you will know. I asked, "Do you notice her <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span>? This queen has a particular kind of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span>, a shrewdness, but without any of the negative implications of that word, 'shrewd.' There's a kind of practical <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span>, a diplomatic <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span>. Do you notice her kind of attuned, appropriate, measured responses to her subjects and to the people in her court, etc.? Do you notice her dignity, her <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nobility" class="internal-link">nobility</a></span>?<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > The queen became a common object among the yogi and Rob" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#The queen became a common object among the yogi and Rob" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^6-1
###### 6-2
So all this was, to me, sort of pregnant in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> and needed a little bit of teasing out to become more palpable, to become more recognizable, and to be recognized, to be witnessed, to be made clear. Again, as a stage of practice, it's possible then to resonate with her qualities. So I see poise, strength, dignity, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nobility" class="internal-link">nobility</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span>, attunement, appropriate response, measured response - all these individual and connected qualities, take your time in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> and just be with them, and witness them, and put the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a></span>, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, and the heart, and the sensibility in touch with, just by virtue of opening to them, and witnessing them, and appreciating them. One opens one's being to those particular qualities, and the being, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> start resonating with those qualities. And in so doing, we absorb those qualities. We absorb, if you like, into our life in ways that can actually then become manifest, practically manifest, really manifest, in our real, physical <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span>, over time.

Now, sometimes people practise with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> and _that's_ the total scope of the intention. Sometimes people even practise <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vajrayana" data-href="Vajrayana" class="internal-link">Vajrayāna</a></span> practices to do that. It's great, you know, and it's a very powerful way of practising. Sometimes people practise _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>_ just by imagining <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Kuan Yin</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Avalokiteśvara</a></span>, or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">Jesus</a></span>, or whatever, and their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, and just beholding that, opening the being to that, and through that, there's this resonance and this absorption, and it begins to ignite and empower those qualities and those capacities in our heart, in our life, in our relationship, etc. So that's wonderful. In _our_ paradigm, we're saying yes, great intention, and wonderful that that happens, but remember the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fullness of intention" class="internal-link">fullness of intention</a></span>. So the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> is not here just to serve me; I am serving the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. And the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fullness of intention" class="internal-link">fullness of intention</a></span> means the fullness of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> here, rather than just this or that quality becoming empowered. This or that quality becoming empowered in my life, and in my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span>, and in my expression, in my speech, in my action, etc., may be _part_ of serving the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. It may be part of what the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> _wants_ from me. It may be part of doing my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="duty" class="internal-link">duty</a></span> to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="daimon" class="internal-link">daimon</a></span>, etc. But really helpful in our paradigm to remember the fuller scope, or the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="fullness of intention" class="internal-link">fullness of intention</a></span> - actually the fullness of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. And included in that can be this absorption of qualities, this empowerment of different aspects and capabilities of our being<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > But the image is not here just to serve me; I am serving the image" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#But the image is not here just to serve me; I am serving the image" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-3

And then we talked, too, about a situation back home with some voluntary work that she was doing, and the relationship with that community, and finding her voice there, and being able to speak up with strength. She saw all that was relevant, there was this echoing/mirroring, or _part_, again, part of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Infinity" data-href="Infinity" class="internal-link">the infinite</a></span> echoing/mirroring was its relevance in the echoing and mirroring to these particular situations with regard to community and how she manifested and spoke up there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Infinite echoing mirroring" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Infinite echoing mirroring" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-1

A second <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> that was shared was a naked goddess who lives in a tree, resides in a tree. One particularly salient feature of this goddess was that she has her legs open, so her legs are spread. And the yogi shared, you know, "It's actually not sexual, but she's opening _my_ legs too." So there's already a relationship of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> as meditator, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> in relationship with this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, and this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, this naked goddess living in the tree, is very gently opening my legs. It doesn't seem sexual. Something very delicate happening. There was a little concern from this yogi. She said, "I'm trying not to become ethereal in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, and I'm trying to retain my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">particular self</a></span>." So again, her initial question with these two <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> was, "What's the relationship between these somewhat puzzling <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>?" She couldn't seem to kind of connect them or ground them. She said, "In this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, I'm really trying not to become ethereal, and to retain my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">particular self</a></span>.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Image Naked goddess who lives in a tree opening of the legs" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Image Naked goddess who lives in a tree opening of the legs" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^7-2

So you don't have to always do that. Even if you become ethereal, it's not a problem. It's not a problem. To become ethereal - we've talked about this - how does the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a></span> feel, and that range from sort of insubstantiality/ethereality, to dense and substantial, and everything in between, as one of the ranges of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. It's all open, and to become ethereal is not a problem. It's just what's happening with this particular <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> at that time. It might be very appropriate to this particular <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. I think in this case it _was_. And also to become ethereal, if my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a></span> becomes ethereal, it's not the same as melting in union and losing the twoness, losing the differentiation between self and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, and with that, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, etc. So there will be the reflecting and the echoing in the life from the twoness; I don't have to _become_ the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. Even when there's a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> and the other, there will still be this infinite reflecting and echoing, just because it's what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> is and does. It's part of it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Its not a problem if you become ethereal" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#It's not a problem if you become ethereal" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-3
###### 7-4
And again, there was a sense here of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> being expressed, and then shared, as if I could sense it as well, I was living that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> at the same time. We were living it together. But I was careful. I didn't want to - always question my inclinations and responses and intuitions, so checking it out with her, "Is this right? Is that right?" And to me, there was a real sense of exquisiteness. So this naked goddess had a real exquisite sort of refined, very sensitive, very delicate quality. I asked her if that was the case, and she said yes. Again, it's like, sometimes, is it not part of _your_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, this exquisiteness that you see in her, in this goddess? Is it not part of _your_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> and _your_ particular kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Blessing" data-href="Blessing" class="internal-link">gifts</a></span> in this life, your particular kind of exquisiteness are being mirrored and echoed in this goddess? Or we could say, more powerfully, I think, we could say your life, your being, your personality, the way you are with your <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, your sensibility echoes and mirrors the exquisiteness, the particular kinds of exquisiteness of this goddess. There's a refraction there. They won't be exactly the same, but there's this emanation that then gets interpreted or reflected in our particular ways. And might then this sense of exquisiteness also be part of what, so to speak, the gods, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">daimons</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span> ask of you<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > The particular kind of exquisiteness were mirrored in the image" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#The particular kind of exquisiteness were mirrored in the image" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^7-4
###### 8-1
So again, not to identify with it, and not to make a rigid, tight ego-belief and ego-view around it. This is the delicacy of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Middle Way" class="internal-link">Middle Way</a></span>. There's a way that can have all the power, witnessing that exquisiteness, a conceiving of it, and sensing more than conceiving, sensing of it, having the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">heart and soul</a></span>-sense of our being and our persona and our <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">narrative</a></span> in this life being a very particular refraction or emanation of that particular exquisiteness of that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. And not to identify with it, but to feel the power of that. And with that, is this not part of what the gods, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">daimons</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, the goddess, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span> are asking of you? So the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> is brought into a very powerful relationship with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, but it's got all the lightness - I mean, partly helped by the ethereality - but it's got all the lightness of touch of non-identification, or not _over_-identifying, put it that way, and making a rigid ego-identity around it. So there's the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="duty" class="internal-link">duty</a></span> wrapped up in it, and the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, and the way this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> then informs and flows into <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>. Again, there are different levels of the way we can sense and conceive this, but<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Our persona being a very particular refraction of the quality of the image" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Our persona being a very particular refraction of the quality of the image" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-1

So there might be, with a lot of these <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> - again, whether they're <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> that are sensed as other, or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> becomes <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, there's the sense of gift, but also <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="duty" class="internal-link">duty</a></span>, ask. And that's part of the deal. It's part of the deal of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal work</a></span> as _we_ conceive it, and part of the deal of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> getting embroiled, involved, or worked on in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking dynamic" class="internal-link">soulmaking dynamic</a></span>, in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> process. You can already hear the beginnings of a different range of views of self, and conceptions of self, and psychologies about self than are maybe more sort of common or dominant in contemporary psychology, etc. Someone asked me a while ago, "I feel like" - they were talking about themselves, now - "I feel like I want to leave an impression. It's like I want to make an imprint, or leave an imprint on" - I think she was saying on _me,_ but also on others. And she was very sceptical about this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. It's like, "Why do I have this ...?" This is a person who has done a lot of practice, a lot of, let's say, mainstream <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma practice</a></span>, and Advaita, and different things, and non-dual practice, and that kind of thing. So she was very wary of this impulse and intention and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> that she noticed within herself, wanting to leave or make an imprint on others, or on a particular other, or particular others. She said, "Why?" And she was judging it. It's easy to assume, under the rubric of many psychological or spiritual <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a></span>, that this is ego. "Why do I have to impress people? Why do I have to try and make this imprint? Why do I have to be important that way?", etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Sense of gift but also duty; Story wanting to leave an impression" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Sense of gift but also duty; Story wanting to leave an impression" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-2
###### 8-3
So we were talking about this, and you can actually ask, "_Who_ wants this?" So her tendency was to be very suspicious of it, and because she had, I suppose, practised so long in paradigms that put aside <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, move towards dissolving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> and just dissolving it in some kind of ultimate <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="oneness" class="internal-link">oneness</a></span>, etc., there was this suspicion. So, "It can only be an ego thing." It was troubling her, really, like some kind of itch or something that she wanted to get rid of. But I said, "We can ask _who_ wants this, _who_ wants to make an imprint?" Maybe it's what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> wants. Maybe it's the way it communicates with other souls, if you like, or we could say amongst its parts, if we're parts of a World <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a></span>, if we're conceiving of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> that way. The way it communicates amongst its parts is by making impressions on the other parts, or one <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> communicates with another by making an impression. And that's what the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> _wants_. So, you know, if I think about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="John Coltrane" class="internal-link">John Coltrane</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Jimi Hendrix" class="internal-link">Jimi Hendrix</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ludwig van Beethoven" data-href="Ludwig van Beethoven" class="internal-link">Beethoven</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Peter Maxwell Davies" class="internal-link">Peter Maxwell Davies</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="James Hillman" class="internal-link">James Hillman</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Etty Hillesum" class="internal-link">Etty Hillesum</a></span>, friends who I <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> deeply, these are all, for me, in my life, deep, beautiful, precious imprints on and in my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. They _are_ my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, or they're part of it. My <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> is informed, has the impression, has the stamp of these deep <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>-<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> - Coltrane, Hendrix, this friend or that friend, etc. And I treasure that. I treasure that. I _want_ to be impressed upon in that way. I want to be impressed upon. Don't we, as souls, _want_ to be impressed upon by <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, and by what is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Maybe the soul communicates by making an impression" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Maybe the soul communicates by making an impression" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^8-3

In that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> to imprint on others I think is actually the nascent sense of an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> self. So it's not necessarily the ego. Again, it's the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> expresses itself in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> to a great extent. It's not just the ego-self that wants to make an imprint, it's the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>-self, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> self, or the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> selves, the budding sense of that that wants to make an imprint on others, a deep <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>-imprint on others. And that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> self, again, it's me and not me. It's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">neither real nor not real</a></span>. But somehow it's very profoundly me. Somehow it's very profoundly me, maybe more profoundly me than anything else. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="The self" class="internal-link">The self</a></span> needs to become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. It wants to become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">Soul</a></span> wants to make things <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, to discover their <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span>. And it needs to imprint. It wants to express itself. It wants to connect with other souls. This is how <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> grows. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking</a></span> _is_ being impressed upon.

If we don't allow the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span> of self, etc., then that impulse to imprint stays as ego - in other words, flatly conceived self - and not <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, but <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>. And the only recourse then is to try to live that out, trying to impress people from this flat level, trying to make an imprint, an impression on people, but it's all flatly conceived, and that's going to be misery for everyone, probably. Or the only other recourse, if we're inhibiting or disallowing or dismissing the possibility of this whole <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>-dimension of self, is to dwell in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">no-self</a></span> (whatever that means), and try and live one's life with this kind of ideal of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">no-self</a></span>, whether that's "I'm just this process of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a></span>," or "I'm just <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>," or whatever it is, or "I'm just <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>," or "I'm just <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharmadhatu" data-href="Dharmadhatu" class="internal-link">cosmic consciousness</a></span>" or whatever. And again, in the way _I_ would understand it, that's great - those particular views of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">no-self</a></span> are wonderful to move in and out of - but to try and live a whole life with all the complexities and demands and particularities of our ways of loving and our creativity and our duties, etc., it doesn't really work<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > We should allow ourselves imaginal dimensions of self" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#We should allow ourselves imaginal dimensions of self" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-2

So without the imaginalizing, the dimensionalizing, the divinizing, the theophanizing of self, our possibilities are very limited, and they don't really work. So, in a way, this person was bumping into repeatedly the failure of a paradigm of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">no-self</a></span> to kind of comprehensively address the totality of her being and her needs (spiritual, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a></span>, etc.). We're just so used to a certain idea: "This is right. This is spiritual. This is psychologically healthy," or whatever, and something else wants to happen. Partly what allows it to happen is to conceive it in a way that gives it some respect, and believes there's a treasure there, believes there's a necessity of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> there. So <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self, other, world</a></span>, and maybe also one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> - there might be <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> to imprint on others, this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> to imprint on others, on the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> of others: my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span> deeply to make this impression, and there's not <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="craving" class="internal-link">craving</a></span>, not even just <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, but _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>_ there.

And I think I touched on this very briefly in an earlier talk in this series, but of course, then, if we allow this and begin to sense it, or allow ourselves to sense it and conceive of it as a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-desire</a></span> - it's not ego, it's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, or if it's allowed to do its thing, it can be <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> as opposed to ego; if we can conceive of it the right way, it can be <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> rather than ego - but of course there's _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ there if it seems like we're _not_ making an imprint. The <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span> want to make an imprint. They need to. Maybe one kind of conception is that it's what _we're_ here for. It's what human beings are here for, to express the divinities, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span> and their particular faces, the faces of the gods. We are here to express the faces of the gods, and the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span> want that, and they want that from us. So that the _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ of feeling like, "I'm not imprinting. There is no connection there in what I'm trying to put out or communicate of my being," the _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ might not even be an ego-_dukkha_, primarily. It might be the _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ of that whole sense of, "This is what the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span> want, and this is what I'm here for, and it's frustrated, it's blocked. There isn't the reception there.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Thats what we humans are here for express the faces of the angels" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#That's what we humans are here for express the faces of the angels" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^10-1

We could say, if we just play with this idea, that the ego's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> to impress is a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> of or a dim echo of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>'s <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> to impress. So again, we could make a whole psychology of this kind of premise or maxim, "The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> wants <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> loves <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>," and that's the urge, that's the fundamental movement in life, and everything else can kind of shake down from that. And what happens sometimes if we play with this conception is that that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>'s <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> to impress gets shrunken, or flattened, or tightened, or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Contraction" data-href="Contraction" class="internal-link">contracted</a></span> around, and so it becomes a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="contraction" class="internal-link">contraction</a></span> or, as I said, a dim echo of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>'s <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> to impress, and it manifests as ego, and it feels like ego. Something's got shrunk. So that kind of conception is quite a different conception of self, and reading or interpretation, hermeneutic of what we're doing in our life, what we're trying to do, or what, if you like, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angels</a></span> are trying to do _through_ us - my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">daimons</a></span>, your <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">daimons</a></span>, are trying to do through you, with you, as you<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > This is quite a different hermeneutic of what were doing in our life" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#This is quite a different hermeneutic of what we're doing in our life" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-2

Some of you will have heard this story from <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Oscar Wilde" class="internal-link">Oscar Wilde</a></span>. I don't know where he was going, but he was travelling between countries, and the customs officer asked him, "Do you have anything to declare?" And he sort of said, "Only my genius." It's funny - I've shared a few quotes of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Oscar Wilde" class="internal-link">Oscar Wilde</a></span> before, and sometimes it seems to me he - I don't know if it's the case, but it's almost like you can hear these little witty quips that he has, and these little retorts that he has to certain situations, on two levels. At one level, it's just a funny sort of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-aggrandizement</a></span> kind of thing, declaring that he's a genius in the way that we usually understand that word. But that word, 'genius,' actually originally referred to something like a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="daimon" class="internal-link">daimon</a></span>. So it wasn't a person _was_ a genius; a person _had_ a genius, a particular genius, like their <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, or their spirit, or their <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="daimon" class="internal-link">daimon</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > A person has a particular genius" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#A person has a particular genius" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-3

So: "Do you have anything to declare? Are you bringing anything with you into this country through customs?" "Am I bringing anything with me? Only my genius. So you can see I have nothing here, and very few bags or whatever it is, but I'm bringing this invisible <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="daimon" class="internal-link">daimon</a></span> that you can't see, like illegal goods might be hidden." He's declaring that. I don't know if that's what he meant, but as I said, a lot of times I get these kind of double-levelled interpretive possibilities, possibilities of interpretation of things he says. And then what's the relationship with that could be very different than the first interpretation of just a kind of ego thing or "I'm a genius. I'm declaring my genius. I'm a really smart guy," or whatever it is. Not ego. It could be the conception of that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="daimon" class="internal-link">daimon</a></span>, of that genius in the original sense: "It's him, not me." And so there's a relationship of humility with that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Oscar Wilde at the customs" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Oscar Wilde at the customs" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-4

But this has really gone out of fashion. If it was ever mainstream in any culture, I don't know, but it's certainly gone out of fashion. I remember in a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="history" class="internal-link">history</a></span> class studying about Stravinsky, the famous, brilliant twentieth century composer. He wrote _Rite of Spring,_ some of you will know. And he was being interviewed by his assistant, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Robert Craft" class="internal-link">Robert Craft</a></span>, and they recorded it at one point. They were talking about the composition of _The Rite of Spring_ back in the early twentieth century, and this was much later. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Robert Craft" class="internal-link">Robert Craft</a></span> got him talking, etc., and at some point Stravinsky said something like, "I was the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="vessel" class="internal-link">vessel</a></span> through which _The Rite of Spring_ was born, through which that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> was born." And then a little while later, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Robert Craft" class="internal-link">Robert Craft</a></span> quoted him back as saying that, and Stravinsky said, "I never said that!" [laughs] <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Robert Craft" class="internal-link">Robert Craft</a></span> said, "You did. It's on the tape recorder." It's kind of slightly taboo, because, I think, like so many other things - <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sexuality" class="internal-link">sexuality</a></span> and all kinds of things - we have such a confused notion of what we're allowed to think and say, and how we're allowed to view self, and what's taboo, and what's regarded as ego, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Strawinsky as vessel for the Rite of Spring" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Strawinsky as vessel for the Rite of Spring" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-1

So in the flow of the conversation, he was expressing perhaps a certain just natural <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of that, of being in the service to something - in this case, the service of - the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> _was_ a piece of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Etienne Souriau" data-href="Etienne Souriau" class="internal-link">Étienne Souriau</a></span>, the French philosopher, sometimes talked about "the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">Angel</a></span> of the work." So this composition, this magnificent, revolutionary twentieth century composition, _The Rite of Spring_, it was or had an <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, and that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> wanted something out of Stravinsky. But then he said, "I never said that." "Yes, you did." [laughs] So we're <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Constriction" data-href="Constriction" class="internal-link">constrained</a></span> and confused by the mixed messages we get about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>. In so many ways, we live in a very egotistical culture, but we also view that badly, and we judge ourselves or others when it _looks_ like they or we are being egotistical. There's nowhere else, there are no other conceptual levels - the conception is so thin and so limited, and we're just shunting back and forth between a rock and a hard place there. Either ego, because we have no other level to think of, and so we pursue things out of a sense of ego and ego-aggrandizement, _or_ the judgment and denigration of that in ourselves and others. There's nothing else, because the wider <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a></span> in the culture offer nothing else. All the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span> have gone, all the possibilities have gone, and there's a real impoverishment there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Were constrained and confused by the mixed messages we get about the self" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#We're constrained and confused by the mixed messages we get about the self" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-2

So Corbin, of course, talked a lot about - actually I, before, talked about - "<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">the angel out ahead</a></span>." It's almost like a counterpart of ourselves, a second half of our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, if you like, and our relationship with that through the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, and the importance of that to the sense of who we are, and the direction we have in life, and our duties to that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, etc. And just paraphrasing a passage from one of his books, _Temple and Contemplation_, I think the book's called - in this case he's calling it the "person <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="archetype" class="internal-link">archetype</a></span>." He said, "That's not a symbol of something in _me_. Rather, it is the earthly, human person, it's me, who, by gravitating towards this spiritual person, this angelhood, I represent and typify hypostasis," meaning an existence, a being, of the angelic world<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Corbins person archetype is not something in _me_ but this earthly person gravitating towards this spiritual person" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Corbin's person archetype is not something in _me_ but this earthly person gravitating towards this spiritual person" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-3

We've talked about this before. "It's representing some aspect of me. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> is a representation." Turning it around: "No, _I_ represent and typify this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span> of the angelic world." And he continues, "The <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> is called upon to answer for it on earth."^[Henry Corbin, _Temple and Contemplation_ (London: Routledge, 2013), 171] So again, there's his way of saying this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Duty" data-href="Duty" class="internal-link">sense of duty</a></span>. Everything is reversed here. He's actually talking about ritual in this passage, so it's how the ritual relates to these kinds of ideas. He says, "Human gestures, human representations and imaginings, are so many methods whereby a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> can be led to typify and exemplify in themselves a celestial existence."

Again, he's talking about ritual, but he says, "If a celestial person, if an <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, is represented by a particular gesture or word or phase of the ritual, then to observe these is already to exist in the manner of that transcendent person.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Human beings can be led to typify and exemplify in themselves a celestial existence" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Human beings can be led to typify and exemplify in themselves a celestial existence" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^11-4

This is very, very common, partly, I think, a result of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">our culture</a></span> - again, of the limited ways of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, limited ways of conceiving <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, but also a result of social fragmentation, individualism, all kinds of things historically. And so I've talked about working with the inner critic in the past. Many years ago, I think, I gave some talks on it. And I gave out a whole set of approaches or things one could do in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>, both at the time that the inner critic is active, if you like, present, and also when it's not active. And some of those involved working with the imagination with regard to the inner critic, in relationship with the inner critic. But that wasn't <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>. So it's working with the imagination, but it's not <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, in _our_ sense<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > The inner critic" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#The inner critic" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-3
###### 12-4
But it might be that we can actually allow things to become <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> with respect to the inner critic. Some of that might start with just a more deliberate imagination. So I'll give just a couple of possibilities, just to start an exploration, perhaps. Sometimes, maybe, perhaps the inner critic could be seen, in a way, it's part of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, it's part of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>, which, among other things, has taken or become the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>-locus of power. When the inner critic is badgering us and kind of taking over and hounding us, all the power, or most of the power, has gone _there_. So there is this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span> with its complexity, this self with its complexity, this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> with its complexity, and all the power of that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> seems to be kind of gathered under the purview and domain of that inner critic, and the rest of the being feels weak, collapsed, etc., lacking in power. But it's actually _my_ <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>, yeah? My self, my <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, is part of that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Possibilities to allow things to become imaginal with respect to the inner critic" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Possibilities to allow things to become imaginal with respect to the inner critic" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-4
###### 13-1
So a couple of possibilities. Sometimes, or maybe, feeling one's frustration and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> at the inner critic - so we're back to this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vessel" data-href="Vessel" class="internal-link">crucible</a></span> thing, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>, and where is the emotion, and where is the kind of point of entry that can allow things to start to become dynamic and galvanize a little bit in terms of certainly liberating process, but maybe even <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> process. Feeling one's frustration, and even one's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> - one can be so fed up with this inner critic. So instead of getting dragged into listening to the inner critic, actually what else is there? "I'm feeling really fed up. I'm feeling really angry at the inner critic." And that, again, the heat of that emotion, I have to sit with it in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a></span>, I have to kind of tease it out of the afflictive mix that's happening at the time<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > 1 Sit with the anger at the inner critic" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#1 Sit with the anger at the inner critic" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-1
###### 13-2
But in being with it, in holding it, in being with it in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a></span> and recognizing it, and actually letting it heat up, letting that frustration and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>, recognizing there may be a treasure here in the frustration and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> which I usually would see as a defilement, as a _kilesa_, as something that's not helpful, letting it build up in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a></span>, in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Alchemy" data-href="Alchemy" class="internal-link">alchemical</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="vessel" class="internal-link">vessel</a></span>, in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vessel" data-href="Vessel" class="internal-link">crucible</a></span>, and out of that, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, might arise. Out of the heat of the frustration and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> at the inner critic, an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> might arise, and that may well have power in it, because frustration and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> have a lot of potential power wrapped up in them. And so another, let's say, another part of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>, so to speak, is empowered, and it changes the relationship with the inner critic<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Letting the anger build up in the energy body so that an image might arise" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Letting the anger build up in the energy body so that an image might arise" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-2
###### 13-3
Another possibility is to go ahead and deliberately imagine - so it might not be <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> at first; don't worry; it might never [be] <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, and might still be liberating - go ahead and deliberately imagine, for example, destroying the inner critic violently. So whatever it is: smashing it to bits, clunking it on the head, you know, whatever. And that deliberate imagination - again, it may not be <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>; it may be liberating without this ever becoming <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, or it may become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> - then that, going ahead and deliberately imagining destroying the inner critic violently, may actually then liberate the feeling of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span>. So in the first approach, it was like, can I feel the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> first? Can I feel the frustration first, and let that constellate an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>? Or it might be that I'm actually playing with the imagination, and _that_ liberates the possibility of feeling that emotion. And in that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> is power. The third step there would be, can I almost filter out the sense of power in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy body" class="internal-link">energy body</a></span> from the feeling of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > 2 Imagine destroying the inner critic violently" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#2 Imagine destroying the inner critic violently" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^13-3
###### 13-4
So those are some possibilities. And again, in that last one I illustrated there, putting those two together, again, there's non-linearity here. It's sort of a tangled ball of wool - I pull on _this_, and it might be that _this_ loosens as well, this other one, this other thread. So there are those possibilities. There's also a slightly different possibility. The inner critic tends to arise more in relation to something we are deeply longing for, or that we actually have <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> for. So someone was talking to me about the inner critic, and I asked her, "When does it come up? Is it just there all the time, or is it certain situations?" And it was coming up actually in relation to, or in the context of, certain situations of public speaking where she really cared about what she was communicating or teaching or whatever it was. Or for a lot of people it comes up in relation to practice, and wanting to practise well<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > The inner critic tends to arise more in relation to something we actually have eros for" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#The inner critic tends to arise more in relation to something we actually have eros for" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^13-4
###### 14-1
So this is interesting, you know. I'm not saying it's always the case; sometimes there's a more pervasive, low-grade sense of inner critic, of course. But oftentimes it's actually coming up in relation to things that we really care deeply about, or that we really long for, or that we have <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> for. So rather than getting caught up with the inner critic, and what it's saying, and what it's doing, etc., again, it may be possible to let that do its thing, but can I kind of contact the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> that's there? I'm judging myself for being a bad meditator or whatever, but actually can I contact the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> to meditate well and deeply, and discover and play in that way? The inner critic's still doing its thing, but I'm just honing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, directing it to other elements, other aspects of the tangle of what's going on. With that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, again, as I touched on earlier, might be wrapped up the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ of the frustrated <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> - you know, I _really_ want this thing, and I'm just frustrated I'm not making any headway, or I really want to be able to communicate well in a teaching situation or whatever, but I feel like I'm not doing well enough. So the _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ of the frustrated <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> might be part of what I come into contact with when I'm kind of looking for the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> underneath, underpinning or associated with this inner critic. And that's okay, because frustration also has this heat element, and it's very close to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > 3 Contact the eros thats there" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#3 Contact the eros that's there" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-1
###### 14-2
But again, out of that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vessel" data-href="Vessel" class="internal-link">crucible</a></span>, out of that, I'm directing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to some elements of the being, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, or even the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>_ of the frustrated <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> - there's heat there, and there's potential dynamism there, and out of that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vessel" data-href="Vessel" class="internal-link">crucible</a></span>, if I can relate to them and hold them the right way, an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> might arise in relation to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, or <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> might become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, and one might have a very different sense of it all, even a different sense of the inner critic, a different sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>. There's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> there, etc<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Theres heat and potential dynamism there" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#There's heat and potential dynamism there" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-2

What was interesting when this person raised this with me was she was taking a public speaking course to try and develop her skills as a public speaker. They were given certain exercises and things like that. But, in this case, I don't think, or it may not be, that the underlying <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>, the deep longing, comes up in the context of those public speaking [exercises] - there might still be self-judgment, but the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> won't be there. But when it came to teaching or speaking in public about what she really loved, what felt really important to her, then there will be the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span>. The other things were just - they were giving exercises or techniques that you can do to kind of improve as a public speaker; all really important, but it wasn't just that she wanted to be a good public speaker just for the sake of it. There were things that she wanted to communicate, that she deeply wanted to communicate and communicate well. So you have to look for the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="desire" class="internal-link">desire</a></span> in the right place if this is the case<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Story wanting to be a good public speaker" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Story wanting to be a good public speaker" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-3

And we'll hopefully come back to this, but there's a way - and I know some of you, probably at this point maybe most of you know this - there's a way that we, as one of the nodes, loving and being loved, we can feel loved by an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> in ways that heal so deeply. So sometimes connecting with an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> and recognizing, feeling, opening to its <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> for us, it's so tailored and so tailored to our being and our particularities, and so attuned to us and empowered by the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span> and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>, etc., that, in a way, that kind of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> have for us, that profound and almost mysterious, mysteriously attuned <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, it can heal the inner critic and that whole painful constellation almost more powerfully, I think, than anything else<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > The love images have for us can heal the inner critic" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#The love images have for us can heal the inner critic" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-4

So if we just lay out some possibilities with regard to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> becoming <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> becoming <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soulful</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>. There is, as I said at the beginning this evening, there is the possibility of externalizing, so to speak, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> that loves this, or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Desire" data-href="Desire" class="internal-link">desires</a></span> that, or feels this way or whatever, and letting that become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> - letting it become other, and then that becomes <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>. And that starts to then echo back and change our <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> and dimensionalize it, etc., and allow it to become more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, more <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. Then there's also the possibility of an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> that is already other, but we sense, "It's me, and it's not me. It's not me, it's other. But somehow it echoes me," and in Corbin's language, we recognize <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">the angel out ahead</a></span>. It has something profoundly to do with me and my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. Somehow it's profoundly me, and it's not me. So that becomes, if you like, part of our <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, part of our <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">soul-sense</a></span> of self, part of our sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Recap externalizing the self; recognizing the angel out ahead" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Recap externalizing the self; recognizing the angel out ahead" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^14-5
###### 15-1
There's another possibility that I haven't really touched on, where an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> can arise and it's sort of apparently impersonal. It seems like it's not to do with self, it's not an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> of self. But actually it's doing something that's allowing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> to gain <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span> and become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. So there are <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> that are apparently impersonal, or that don't retain particularities. For example, I've been reading, in the last few years at different times, a little bit about what's called the ten _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Sefirot" class="internal-link">Sefirot</a></span>_. It's a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kabbala" data-href="Kabbala" class="internal-link">Kabbalistic</a></span> teaching. They're ten - I don't know what you would call them - aspects of the Godhead, or aspects of God, or aspects of the way God emanates from the sort of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="unfabricated" class="internal-link">unfabricated</a></span>, dark mystery of the innermost being of God, emanating these ten qualities (so <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, and strength, and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span>, etc.). And there's all kinds of literature on this, and ways it's interpreted, etc. So I was meditating one day with having read about this, and then with the idea that my being contains or expresses these ten _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="sefirot" class="internal-link">sefirot</a></span>_, these ten aspects of God - _our_ beings do; everyone's being does<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > The ten Sefirot - aspects of God expressed by us" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#The ten Sefirot - aspects of God expressed by us" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-1

So they, themselves, are part of and rooted in the divine, and are emanations, as I said, at different levels of the divine or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a></span>, if you prefer that word. And again, in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> language, _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharmakaya" data-href="Dharmakaya" class="internal-link">dharmakāya</a></span>_ actually means the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> of qualities of a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>. That was one of the original meanings of it. And it came to have other <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span> of meaning. So there's a similarity there between the teaching of _<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharmakaya" data-href="Dharmakaya" class="internal-link">dharmakāya</a></span>_ and _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Sefirot" class="internal-link">Sefirot</a></span>_. But then [it] was added to in my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> with this idea that my being contains and expresses those ten _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Sefirot" class="internal-link">Sefirot</a></span>_, those ten aspects of the divine, of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a></span>. And meditating in that way, the _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Sefirot" class="internal-link">Sefirot</a></span>_, they remain impersonal, but <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> begins to be given a kind of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span>, and it's complexified, etc., in that way. And because of that, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> begins to become <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>. And then, as I said right from the beginning with the fountain basin analogy, also then the world in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a></span> starts to become <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> as <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> became <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>.

So you can hear, "Well, that all sounds quite universal and impersonal, in a way. Although <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> is involved, it seems to be being seen as just a universal kind of manifestation of God, of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha-nature" class="internal-link">Buddha-nature</a></span>, of these ten qualities that everyone has." But there was a way of doing it where my particularities were retained. I wasn't dissolving the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>, or omitting the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>. My <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">narrative</a></span>, my struggles, my joys, all that was included in this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of God and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of human <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span>, if you like, of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> and the continuity of that in terms of the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Sefirot" class="internal-link">Sefirot</a></span>_, the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> as emanation of the _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Sefirot" class="internal-link">Sefirot</a></span>,_ but without dissolving the particularities, without omitting me and my <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">narrative</a></span> and struggles and all that. So there's the particular, unique way these ten _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Sefirot" class="internal-link">Sefirot</a></span>_ manifest and express through me. So something that can start as an apparently impersonal <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, or even sound like it, actually can be, by including the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">narrative</a></span> and the particulars and the uniqueness, can be rendered more unique, retain its particularities, retain its <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="personhood" class="internal-link">personhood</a></span> and uniqueness to self. You know, there are all kinds of possibilities; I'm just throwing out a few here<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > My particularities were retained in the meditation not just a universal kind of manifestation of God" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#My particularities were retained in the meditation not just a universal kind of manifestation of God" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^15-3
###### 16-1
But if we linger for a moment with this particular area of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> or senses of self that are apparently impersonal, it's worth mentioning (some of you may know this): in some of the Buddhist tantras, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tantra" data-href="Tantra" class="internal-link">tantric</a></span> texts, the elements - for example, earth, air, fire, water, sometimes space, sometimes <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, either four or five or six elements - are, we could say, personified, or associated with certain divinities, certain bodhisattvas or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Buddha" data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddhas</a></span> or goddesses. You could say, more than that, you could say that the elements are the refractions of those goddesses, for instance. So in the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Guhyasamaja Tantra" data-href="Guhyasamaja Tantra" class="internal-link">Guhyasamāja Tantra</a></span>_, for example, there are four goddesses: <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mamaki" data-href="Mamaki" class="internal-link">Māmakī</a></span>, who is or is behind or emanates or symbolizes liquidity, the water element; <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Locana" data-href="Locana" class="internal-link">Locanā</a></span>, who symbolizes, who represents, who emanates, who is the element of earth, of solidity; _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pandara" data-href="Pandara" class="internal-link">Paṇḍara</a></span>_, who symbolizes or emanates or is the goddess of heat, fire, warmth element; and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tara" data-href="Tara" class="internal-link">Tārā</a></span>, who manifests or emanates or is the goddess of air, the air element<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Parallel to tantra elements are refractions of the goddesses" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Parallel to tantra elements are refractions of the goddesses" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-1
###### 16-2
So for some <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tantra" data-href="Tantra" class="internal-link">tantric</a></span> practitioners who base themselves, for example, on the _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Guhyasamaja Tantra" data-href="Guhyasamaja Tantra" class="internal-link">Guhyasamāja Tantra</a></span>_, practising that way, that would form part of their _maṇḍala_ and part of their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span>. There are different ways you can do this - some of it will be very prescribed, but there's no reason why one can't improvise with it a little bit. So sometimes, one may be meditating outside with a sense of the elements in relationship to one's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, and there's a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span> of, for example, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="four elements" class="internal-link">four elements</a></span>. One plays with that, one encourages it, or it just opens by itself, and one senses them as divine, maybe as goddesses, personal divinities in this case, or one's following this prescribed <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. So that's all lovely, and we could include that in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soulmaking" data-href="Soulmaking" class="internal-link">Soulmaking Dharma</a></span> and that kind of thing in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal practice</a></span>. There was once - maybe it was on the _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Foundations of a Soulmaking Dharma" class="internal-link">Foundations of a Soulmaking Dharma</a></span>_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>; I can't remember. I think it was in a Q & A.^[Rob Burbea, "Sailing the Oceans of Soul (Q & A)" (27 June 2018), question one, https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/210/talk/51532] Someone asked me, and I responded sort of categorizing the different kinds of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> that can arise. There are the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> in the way that we talk about them for the most part, but then there are other variations where you can kind of get this formless space that retains the essence of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">particularity</a></span>, of the character, of whatever <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a></span> one was meditating on, but the actual sensible apprehension of that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a></span> has gone, and it just retains their character - an empty space with their character. It can be very beautiful, very profound. That's a possibility<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Meditating with the four elements sense them as divine" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Meditating with the four elements sense them as divine" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-2
###### 16-3
There's also a whole possibility - what often tends to happen with more prescribed <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span> or archetypes, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avalokiteshvara" data-href="Avalokiteshvara" class="internal-link">Kuan Yin</a></span> or these four goddesses from the _Guhyasamāja_, for instance, or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tara" data-href="Tara" class="internal-link">Tārā</a></span>, where it's almost like one's working with an <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a></span>, but that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Imaginal" data-href="Imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal figure</a></span> is kind of, in a way, semi-universal. And that's fine. That's a very popular form of practice, of using the imagination or visualization, especially for <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vajrayana" data-href="Vajrayana" class="internal-link">Vajrayāna</a></span> practitioners. And it can stay there - like this goddess, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tara" data-href="Tara" class="internal-link">Tārā</a></span> or whoever it is, doesn't really become a fully particularized character the way <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Image" data-href="Image" class="internal-link">images</a></span>, in the sense that we _mostly_ are talking about them, tend to. But it's still really valid and can be really fruitful. And of course, an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> may start that way, in a sort of more universal <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Archetype" data-href="Archetype" class="internal-link">archetypal</a></span> sense of this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Tara" data-href="Tara" class="internal-link">Tārā</a></span> or this goddess or whatever it is, and then become more particularized with practice - not that it should or shouldn't; it's just a slightly different realm that one's in, a slightly different direction<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > The more prescribed images and archetype are semi-universal but can become particularized with practice" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#The more prescribed images and archetype are semi-universal but can become particularized with practice" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-3
###### 16-4
Or, again, it could be, for instance, in practising, let's say, sensing the elements with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="four elements" class="internal-link">four elements</a></span> (earth, air, fire, water), and letting them become divinities, goddesses like that, again, then as one meditates it may be, and one might be able to steer it this way or it might just happen this way (it's not better or worse), that they become particularized, these goddesses, or their relationship with _this_ <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, _this_ self, and the elements in relation to these more universal archetypes, that relationship relates to this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">particular self</a></span>. And again, as we said in the example of practising with the ten _<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Sefirot" class="internal-link">Sefirot</a></span>_, the particulars of _this_ self, and _this_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, and the way the elements _have_ manifested in this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and in this life and in this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">narrative</a></span>, and _do_ manifest right now and will in the future, _that's_ where the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">particularity</a></span> is not just retained but also then involved and - what's the word? - highlighted and amplified, even, in the practice. So they remain somewhat universal, the elements and the goddesses behind them, in this example, but it starts to become more personal through the relationship, how do those elements, how have they been incorporated into my life, _this_ life, _this_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">narrative</a></span>, _this_ being, _this_ self, _this_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. Yes? So that's a possibility. Actually, there are a couple of possibilities there - letting it be more universal and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Archetype" data-href="Archetype" class="internal-link">archetypal</a></span>, and it becoming less so through the particularization, the uniqueness of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, or through the gradual particularization and uniqueness of these divine figures, they become more particular, more like proper characters<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > They can become more personal through how they have been incorporated into my life" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#They can become more personal through how they have been incorporated into my life" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^16-4
###### 17-1
So you can see there are all kinds of tributaries of possibilities here in this. But even if something starts apparently impersonal - I mean, it can _stay_ impersonal and still be very <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>, very beautiful, very fruitful kinds of practice, _or_ there are ways that it can be apparently impersonal and then gain more relevance to the personal self and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">particularity</a></span>, either in oneself or in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span>. So just throwing out some different possibilities here. We're talking about what can support the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span> becoming <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span>, and the sense of then dimensionalizing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> and sensing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> as having divine roots, as being <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">theophany</a></span>, etc., as having its origins in other <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span>. I mentioned several times now ways of practising where one has a kind of panoramic view or bird's-eye view of the whole of one's life, as if from the other side of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, beyond <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Death" data-href="Death" class="internal-link">after death</a></span>, so to speak - seeing, almost all at once, as a tableau, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="birth" class="internal-link">birth</a></span>, the life, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">narrative</a></span>, and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>, sort of from the perspective of eternity. And one can just play with that. It may take a little practice, but it's just using the imagination a certain way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Seeing everything from a birds-eye view from the perspective of eternality" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Seeing everything from a bird's-eye view from the perspective of eternality" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-1
###### 17-2
In gaining that perspective on life, then, it can be that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eternality" class="internal-link">eternality</a></span> element, the node of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eternality" class="internal-link">eternality</a></span>, is triggered, is ignited, and that can then allow the sensing of one's life - of one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="birth" class="internal-link">birth</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">narrative</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> - from this perspective, from the eternal perspective, if you like, and the whole thing can be sensed with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. It starts to flesh out and come alive, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">ensouled</a></span> - one sees it, one senses oneself, one's life, one's journey, all of it with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. So I've mentioned that a couple of times, but actually there's all kinds of possibility when we get into the domain of time and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link">timelessness</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a></span> of time and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="eternality" class="internal-link">eternality</a></span>, etc. I don't know if you've ever experienced this, but sometimes in your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> for someone - a human other, or beloved other, maybe an animal, even, or a tree or something - where there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>, sometimes it's possible, because of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and because of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span>, that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, of course, becomes <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soulmaking" class="internal-link">soulmaking</a></span>. You actually sense them with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> at times, this beloved other. And sometimes it's a possible, I find very lovely <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>, to perceive this other, this beloved other, or oneself, even, as the sort of contemporaneous totality of the temporal slices of their life<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Triggered eternality node" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Triggered eternality node" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-2
###### 17-3
In other words, one can see plainly, they are with them, and it's now, and they are X years old, whatever that is, but somehow I'm seeing not just that, but I'm seeing them when they were a little girl, I'm seeing them when they were a baby, I'm seeing them when they were a teenager, I'm seeing them in the full bloom of adulthood, I'm seeing them when they're an old person, I'm seeing them when they're very old, etc., and all those kind of temporal slices exist at once, all those ages, and one loves them all, and one perceives them all at once in the being. Again, in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">sensing with soul</a></span>, through the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eros" class="internal-link">eros</a></span> inseminating <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psyche" class="internal-link">psyche</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>, inseminating the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> object, the beloved other, and it complexifies, it diversifies, it presents other faces, more and more faces, more and more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span>. So that's one very lovely way of perceiving either oneself at times or someone you <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span>. All kinds of possibilities, though, when we get into the realm of time and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of time<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Seeing all temporal slices of the beloved other at once" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Seeing all temporal slices of the beloved other at once" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^17-3
###### 18-1
Another possibility - and last one for now, but - another possibility is meditating on an aspect of your being. So it could be the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, or anything, it could be the voice, etc., and meditating on it in a way, sensing it in a way that allows it to become <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Soul" data-href="Soul" class="internal-link">ensouled</a></span>, allows it to gain <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dimensionality" data-href="Dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensions</a></span> and significance for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> and the elements to come alive with respect to that aspect or area or domain of our being. And then, maybe from there, then it spreads to the whole <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">sense of self</a></span>. So, could give an example of this, but might even try it as a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">guided meditation</a></span>, if you feel like, right now, just very briefly, to give you a sense of what the kind of possibilities are<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Meditating on an aspect of your being and sensing it in a way to become ensouled" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Meditating on an aspect of your being and sensing it in a way to become ensouled" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^18-1

And then, within the scope of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> and the bodily functions, let's just focus in on the voice. So as far as the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> is concerned, we can kind of identify maybe three or four regions or centres of voice production in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, that are involved in vocalizing, in making sound. So there's the chest. The air in the lungs, and the whole resonant cavity of the chest. So just to be aware of that. It's part of the instrument, part of the miracle, part of what allows you to sing forth, sound forth, communicate, reach out to touch other people through your voice, to express your uniqueness, your point of view. Let yourself be aware of your chest, in the context of the gift of voice, the mystery of voice<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Focus on the voice i e centres of voice production in the body" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Focus on the voice i e centres of voice production in the body" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^19-1

And there's the throat and the voice box or the larynx. Also obviously integral to the production of sound, our voicing in the world. A part of the gift. And the mouth, the malleable cavity of the mouth - can shape itself as a resonant chamber to, in all kinds of ways, all kinds of amazingly precise ways, to really shape sound very precisely, very uniquely. Then there's the tongue and the teeth, which are also included in the instrument, part of what allows, shapes, and supports, forms the voice, the sounding. So this miracle, this gift of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="embodiment" class="internal-link">embodiment</a></span>, and part of that miracle, that gift of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="embodiment" class="internal-link">embodiment</a></span>, is this particular set of areas, regions, centres of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> that are involved in vocalization, in voice<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Larynx mouth tongue teeth" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Larynx mouth tongue teeth" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^19-2

In the voice, there's obviously the possibility of carrying verbal communication. We communicate ideas and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="feelings" class="internal-link">feelings</a></span> and requests and all kinds of things, as I elucidated. There's also the sound itself, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> of speech. So often when we listen to someone speak or we speak ourselves, we're concentrating on the words and their meaning. But there's also the parallel, intertwined, ongoing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> - the sounds, the syllables, the mystery of that. Somehow, this, too, is part of the communication of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>. Of course it's there when we sing, etc., but it's there when we speak. This <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span>, right now, as I'm speaking.

Listen to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> of it. It doesn't _mean_ anything, but it's full of meaning_fulness_. The mystery of this ability to vocalize. Doesn't matter what sound right now, what syllable. [_"ssssss", "ah," "tuh," scatting sounds, "ahh," "dsk"_] If you want to, you can press pause and, for a few minutes, just play with that. Let yourself vocalize meaningless or apparently meaningless sounds, and hear it as <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span>, sense the mystery there.

Maybe that gives you an idea. As I was saying, you could take any area or aspect of the being - voice we did, could be <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> or whatever - and meditate on it in a way that supports or opens the possibility of sensing that domain of your being with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, and from there it can spread to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> and perhaps even in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cosmology" data-href="Cosmology" class="internal-link">cosmopoesis</a></span>, etc. So like I said, these are just some possibilities. The possibilities are infinite, really, for the ways that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> can become <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> and gain that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="divinity" class="internal-link">divinity</a></span> and all that in our sense of it. Really, we might turn it around and say, what actually gets _in the way_ of that happening? What prevents us sensing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>? One is, of course, as usual, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span>, an idea, a conception that disallows it. So, for example, the example I gave earlier, this wanting to make an imprint or this wanting to make an impression - I just assume that it's ego and it's not okay, and I judge it. There's a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span> there that's actually limiting my sense of things and my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> of myself and my impulses and the movements of my being. So very often, a certain <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="logos" class="internal-link">logos</a></span> gets in the way, and we don't even realize it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > 1 a logos that disallows it" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#1 a logos that disallows it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^20-5

If I'm too identified with it, problem. It will squeeze the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span> out of it, like squeezing the juice out. Or, on the other hand, I just dismiss it: "Oh, that's crazy. That's stupid. That's not real." Over-reification or under-reification, in a way.

Sometimes, of course, a person's gone the other way, and they've identified _too_ much with that angelic dimension or the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> self, need a bit less reification sometimes. But, you know, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">our culture</a></span> doesn't really support that view of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dimensionality" class="internal-link">dimensionality</a></span> of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personhood" data-href="Personhood" class="internal-link">human being</a></span> in our sense of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="imaginal" class="internal-link">imaginal</a></span> self, of the angelic refraction. So because the culture doesn't, we might need to lean on it a bit more, to relegitimize it, reinstate it and open up that possibility. But it's also very individual, and it can vary at different times and different situations. But there is the possibility of sensing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a></span>, sensing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span> as a temporal emanation of what is timeless, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon" data-href="Daimon" class="internal-link">angel</a></span>, a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Divinity" data-href="Divinity" class="internal-link">theophany</a></span>. We hold it lightly, and in that light holding of it, as I said, it can have enormous power, bear enormous fruit, something very, very beautiful<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Our culture doesnt really support that view of the dimensionality of the human being" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Our culture doesn't really support that view of the dimensionality of the human being" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^21-2
