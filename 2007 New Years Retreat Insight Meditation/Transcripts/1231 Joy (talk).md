_The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> placed great emphasis on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> (<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mudita" class="internal-link">mudita</a></span>) and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a></span> (sukkha) as part of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>. This talk explores the place of these beautiful and precious qualities in our practice, and life. What are the foundations of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>? What is it that allows the heart to open to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>?_ ^1-1
###### 1-2
And so what about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>? What about <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>? We may <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a></span> that, and it's relatively common in interviews or group interviews or for someone to say, "What about <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>? You're going on and on about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and I'm actually experiencing <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, and I'm not even sure if it's okay." [laughter] And to someone who might just peer in here from time to time - like some of our neighbours kind of look in on us from afar, from a safe distance - and look at people shuffling back and forth, staring at the floor, wrapped in blankets, and it looks pretty grim. [laughter] ^1-2

The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> also referred to it as a path of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>. So he quite commonly contradicted himself, and was quite happy doing that. It was a path of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>. And his followers, you know, the monks and nuns and the lay practitioners, they were - how could you tell a follower of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>? Radiance, joyfulness. It was a mark of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > According to the Buddha its a path of joy" data-href="Joy (talk)#According to the Buddha it's a path of joy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3

And it's interesting: well, if we just think about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> in the West, last (what is it?) thirty-something years, thirty and a few, thirty-something years, a lot of emphasis on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, on the being with, and then a little while later, sort of, "Okay maybe we need to add some <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mett훮</a></span>." And a big, big emphasis on kind of lubricating the practice with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mett훮</a></span> and really the necessity of that, of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to the climate of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>. Of course we talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Mett훮</a></span> [and] <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> are two of the four what's called <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavih훮ras</a></span>, '<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">divine abidings</a></span>.' And <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> is another one. So there's a lot of talk about these: <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. And sometimes <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> doesn't receive the same emphasis, the same care of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, really<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > Sometimes in the West joy does not receive the same attention as other brahmaviharas" data-href="Joy (talk)#Sometimes in the West joy does not receive the same attention as other brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4

The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> _did_ actually talk a lot about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, and there are different kinds of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, different kinds of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>. He talked about worldly and non-worldly <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, or worldly and non-worldly <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, which sounds a bit strange. But worldly and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">spiritual joy</a></span>. And so not at all to deny the range and the kinds of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> that are available to us as human beings, but when we talk about <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">spiritual joy</a></span> or <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, it's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, not based on the ego, not based on what I am getting, not based on being better than someone, on measuring up in a certain way. Also not based on sense gratification; that's a little bit more subtle, and I'll come back to that later. Not based on sense gratification<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > Worldly and spiritual joy" data-href="Joy (talk)#Worldly and spiritual joy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-5

So it's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> that comes from <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a></span> of the beautiful qualities of heart; <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> that comes from <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a></span>, cultivating <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a></span>; <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> that comes from opening, from connecting, from perceiving <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>, from developing our capacity to perceive <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>, from the deepening of our practice, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> in practice itself, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> in the teachings, in hearing the teachings, in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sangha" data-href="Sangha" class="internal-link">Sa昭꿪ha</a></span>, in the community of people who <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> to practise, who are interested in practising. This is all <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">spiritual joy</a></span>. And very traditionally, this third brahmavih훮ra, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">mudit훮</a></span>, often gets translated as <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">sympathetic joy</a></span>, which means <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> of others. So instead of envy or feeling, "Why have they got this, and why haven't I got that?", it's delighting in the delight of others. That's how <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">mudit훮</a></span> is usually translated, but I feel it's a little bit too narrow of a translation. So really this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">mudit훮</a></span>, this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">spiritual joy</a></span> encompasses everything of what I've just said<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > Different ways spiritual joy expresses itself" data-href="Joy (talk)#Different ways spiritual joy expresses itself" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-6

Maybe <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> has a very significant and important place in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>. Maybe it really is something that we need to give <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to. There's deep <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a></span>.

One of the things we're doing in practice, as well, is we're <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a></span> the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and the heart. So it may not sound that glamorous, but our minds, in a way, are run in loops. They run round and round in loops and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span>. A lot of those are not very joyful. You just have to sit a day in silence and witness some of those, see those loops, see those <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span>. They're not joyful or bringing of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>. And a big part of what we're doing in practice is we're <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a></span> those loops. Just replacing these tired, old loops that are not helpful, replacing them with <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>. When we give <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, it becomes so that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> moves towards becoming a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a></span>. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> finds a groove in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, instead of a groove in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a></span>, in negativity, in difficulty<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > Joy is helpful in the practice of reconditioning of the mind and heart" data-href="Joy (talk)#Joy is helpful in the practice of reconditioning of the mind and heart" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2

<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Joy</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, is also purifying. So this is quite an interesting one. May not at first be obvious. When we perhaps reflect or think, what does this mean, we hear about a 'path of purification,' 'this is a path of purification,' we tend to think, "What is purification going to look like and feel like? It's going to look like and feel like a lot of pretty nasty stuff coming up and out, and I kind of have to just sit through that and bear with it. And the more miserable it is, the better I'm scrubbing out the system." You know, _maybe_ there's some truth to that, but I don't know<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > Joy is also purifying" data-href="Joy (talk)#Joy is also purifying" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Joy</a></span> brings openness. It's purifying. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Joy</a></span> is also clarifying. So a joyful state has a lot more clarity in it than an unhappy state, which tends to be quite confused, agitated. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Joy</a></span> brings this purification through clarity. It also brings purification because it transforms our intentions - slowly, gradually, non-linearly over time. The more <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> we have just coming and going, the more we feel we have enough. There's just more and more, very gradually, probably almost imperceptibly in our life, in our life of practice. More and more, we feel like we have enough. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> doesn't need to move out so much in greed, in envy. Doesn't move so much in the tight confines of stinginess. You feel like you have enough. It's purifying. It's purifying of the intentions. We have enough. It overflows. We can give. We feel we have enough<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > The more joy we have just coming and going the more we feel we have enough" data-href="Joy (talk)#The more joy we have just coming and going the more we feel we have enough" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4

<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Joy</a></span>, also, in a very natural, organic way, moves towards <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. Its natural movement in the fullness of time is to move towards <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> - a beautiful, rich, deep <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. That's just the way <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> matures. We talk a lot about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> and the ability to stay really steady, really <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Spaciousness" data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">spacious</a></span>, really present. It's an outcome of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>.

###### 2-7
Now, we can assume, and this is, I think, quite common, that perhaps <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> is a bit superficial compared with the real heavy, dark stuff that we need to deal with. I come across that quite a lot, and certainly reflecting on my own past, really feel that I was very much in that view for quite some years. I really had to get in there, and if I was working deeply, that was when I was in contact with what was difficult. If I was in contact with what was difficult, that was a sign that, "Oh, this is really deep work. The real work is through going through the hard stuff, which is unhappy." So just to ask, all of us to ask ourselves: where is my assumption on that? What is my assumption on that? What do I assume about the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of depth and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a></span>? What do I assume about transformation? That it's through, again, through this sort of difficult misery that it comes<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > Does real work have to go through hard unhappy stuff" data-href="Joy (talk)#Does real work have to go through hard unhappy stuff" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^2-7
###### 3-1
And it can be that not so much <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a></span>, although perhaps <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a></span>, but just a lack of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> can, very commonly, just be our normal state. Our normal state is actually not that happy. And then we take that, because it's normal, we take it to be natural. This is quite interesting. It takes quite a lot of, I'd say, investigation to see that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a></span> is more kind of pumped up. It takes more work to be unhappy than it does to be happy. It's not at all obvious at first, but once you really get into this, watching the back and forth between <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a></span>, what's involved in supporting each, it takes quite a lot to support <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a></span>. How much thought is often involved in supporting <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a></span>? We need quite a complex sort of structure of thought holding the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a></span> up<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > Sometimes a lack of happiness is our default state" data-href="Joy (talk)#Sometimes a lack of happiness is our default state" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1

So all human beings are interested in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, and we assume that we're interested in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>. But I also feel that it's actually quite rare for someone to be, I don't know what the word is, _ruthlessly_ interested in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>. [laughs] You know, it's a clich챕 to say, we look in the wrong places for <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>. And we _do,_ and we all know that, but it's become meaningless. And we're bombarded with advertisements saying, either deliberately telling us or very unsubtly or subtly implying that you need this or you need that, or you need to do this or that, or look like this or that to be happy. That's the kind of message. We're bombarded with that. And so in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="spiritual circles" class="internal-link">spiritual circles</a></span>, or even self-help circles, whatever it is, it's a clich챕 to say we're looking in the wrong place. But it's actually quite rare, I think, for someone to really kind of take this bull by the horns and say, "Let me get to the bottom of this question of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>. Let me not let go of it. Let me go right, keep hanging on, and not settle for anything kind of second best." And it may be, I think it _is_ actually, it may be, that a full inquiry into <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, into <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, turns out to be the same thing as an inquiry into <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">freedom from suffering</a></span> - that to follow one question to its end is to follow the other question to its end.

There are a lot of words, you know - <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> - a lot of ranges of what that means, and I don't want to get too hung up on words tonight. But I just want to drop something in about another word, very briefly: fulfilment. There was a survey of parents. I can't remember where or when, but it tested in some way their <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> before being parents and after being parents. And pretty common, pretty strong result, that they were less happy once they were parents. [laughter] But fortunately there was a little sophistication on the part of the psychologists. They had another question, rating their sense of fulfilment, and that was often much higher<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > Fulfilment" data-href="Joy (talk)#Fulfilment" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-4

What I'm trying to say is, it's a complex picture here, and not to grab too much on one thing. If I think about teaching sometimes, you know, the truth is oftentimes it's very challenging. It's very hard. There's a lot about it that's difficult and tiring and all the rest of it. And yet, I would say, I would never - I mean, sometimes it's totally joyful, and it's a real <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> to share the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span>; mostly it is. But I can, without hesitation, always say that it's deeply fulfilling. It's something profoundly fulfilling, with all the difficulties. Before I was a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma teacher</a></span>, I was a musician, and in the later years a composer. The artistic process, if one really cares about creating something, really cares about what it is one's expressing, a lot of frustration in that process, a lot of the nitty-gritty and the sort of really trying to get it right. Is that a joyful process? I don't know. Is it fulfilling? Yes. So just to paint a bit of a bigger picture<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > Activities might not be joyful but they can still be fulfilling" data-href="Joy (talk)#Activities might not be joyful but they can still be fulfilling" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-5

And when we talk about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, there's such a huge range, and all the way from someone literally feeling like they're going to burst in ecstasy - that _does_ happen, and there are people in this hall I know who have come to me and said something like that more than once. Bubbly <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, still <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, quiet <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, peaceful <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>. <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Joy</a></span> has so much of a range, so many textures to it, and I want to really talk about the whole thing, the whole range. A lot of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> is not that remarkable. I really want to include that tonight. If you're listening and you think, "Oh, gosh, I've never had that," I really want to include that, because that's _as_ significant.

And so involved in it, and so swept up by it, and so overjoyed with it that afterwards, after the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="music" class="internal-link">music</a></span> had stopped, for quite a while afterwards, their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of the world, it changed their <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> so deeply for a period of time, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> of the world was that the whole world was <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, the whole universe was the expression of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > Example Ode to Joy" data-href="Joy (talk)#Example Ode to Joy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-2

<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Joy</a></span> can relativize a lot. The presence of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> can relativize a lot of other things in our life. We talk a lot about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span>, and say, "Let go, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">just let go</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">just let go</a></span>." But oftentimes we need something else to hang on to. We need something else to hang on to before we can let go. It's too much to ask someone who feels impoverished inside to let go of something. Of course they're going to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a></span>.

There's a story the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> once - you know, because they lived on alms, just receiving whatever they received for food that day. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> went on alms round one day in a village, and he was next to another monk from a different tradition, and that monk got fed and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> didn't get fed. And this other monk kind of turned to the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> and said, "Huh, now what are you going to do?", something like that. [laughter] "Big <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>!"

So I just want to say, I'm aware listening to this that it can actually be difficult to hear. It can be difficult to hear about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>. And especially when we hear about that range and we feel like, "Gosh, no idea about ..." For some people, that _does_ come, and for others it feels like totally alien to their range of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>. So it can be difficult to hear, and I really appreciate that. It can bring up for us an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> of the absence of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> in our life. Again, like I said the other night, can there be just a backing off of the measuring, and just a listening to what's possible?

One might be listening and have completely the opposite, or in one's day here there's actually sadness, there's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a></span>. Sadness and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> are dependent on the way we look, are dependent on the way we relate. If there is sadness at any time, if there is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a></span>, just an experiment, an experiment: what if when there's sadness and there's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a></span>, one just very delicately, very lightly put the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> on the heart <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span>? Just in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="centre" class="internal-link">centre</a></span> of the chest, very delicate, very light, a very allowing, delicate, open <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> there. And just was _with_ that sense of sadness. And in particular, in a very sort of fundamental level, with its sense of unpleasantness, the texture of the difficulty of it. Christina, I think it was Christina, talked about _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Vedana" data-href="Vedana" class="internal-link">vedan훮</a></span>_ earlier: pleasant, unpleasant, neutral. What if one just stayed very, very delicate, very open, very caring with the sense of unpleasantness in the heart area when there's sadness there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > Sadness and joy are dependent on the way we look" data-href="Joy (talk)#Sadness and joy are dependent on the way we look" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^5-1

If one could do that, and one had a connection, one was connected to that with presence, one was interested, sustained an interest, and one was accepting, completely allowing of that sadness, of that unpleasantness, and one was steady with those three things: connection, interest, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="acceptance" class="internal-link">acceptance</a></span> - C-I-A, if the CIA is there. [laughs] Maybe it's a stupid thing to say, but I would almost bet, I would almost wager that just slowly, gradually, if one can sustain that kind of relationship, it would turn into <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>. Probably just a very, very quiet <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>. It's through the relationship. It's through, it's dependent on our relationship that sadness arises and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a></span> arises. It's dependent on our relationship that <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> arises. So this really is an invitation to experiment with this. Even as I'm talking, if you feel like, "Oof, I don't know," try this.

I remember when I must have been about six or seven or something, and every year we had my cousins in Italy, and we used to drive, the whole family in the car, three days, which was interesting, across Europe to Italy, through France and Switzerland. And somewhere, I don't remember where it was, we stopped once, and there was a sort of go-kart track, ostensibly for kids, but it had traffic lights, and sort of complex road junctions, and the cars had gears and all this stuff. And I was however old, 6 or 7. My younger brother just looked right at it and leapt into the thing, full-on accelerator, and zoomed off, happy as Lewis Hamilton or whatever. And I was completely just overwhelmed, and just completely, I just froze. It seemed so complicated, and so, like, how do I even navigate this? And of course now driving is just, well, you don't even think about it. You just drive and have a complicated conversation with somebody. Just over time, it's a skill that develops.

We talk about non-attachment and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span>; maybe grabbing hold of what brings <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>. And later, we can let go of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> too. But it will only be because we're <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> for something better. So he uses an analogy of a ladder, climbing a ladder. You don't let go of one rung until you've grabbed hold of the other one. There's something that's helping our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span>, that's moving us on. That may not be an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a></span> that resonates very comfortably with a lot of people, because the notion of a ladder and holding on, it seems goal-oriented. We could get really into that; I won't tonight. What are the views about that? Is there a place for that view in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>, _as well_ as this other approach? They don't have to be mutually exclusive. There's also room for another approach of "Let it all come, let it all go.

So the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> talked a lot about what brings <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, and just repeating a little bit what we talked about the other night: <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sila" data-href="Sila" class="internal-link">s카la</a></span>, this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ethics" class="internal-link">ethics</a></span>. He talked about the bliss of blamelessness. It's just that we care so much about how we are in life and what we're putting out that we can rest in our own sense of goodness. We can rest without worry about the repercussions of our actions: "Will so-and-so find out what I said about them behind their back? Will they find me out about whatever it is?" And there's a real foundation for <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> there. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dana" data-href="Dana" class="internal-link">D훮na</a></span>, he talked endlessly about <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dana" data-href="Dana" class="internal-link">d훮na</a></span>, and how much <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dana" data-href="Dana" class="internal-link">d훮na</a></span> and giving, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="generosity" class="internal-link">generosity</a></span>, the generous heart is a happy heart.

So what feeds it; what also eats away at <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>? Some of it's really obvious: worry. Worry is something we really have to learn in practice - it's a gradual learning - we learn how to work with worry, in a way, draining it of its <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>. There are some things in life, you know, there's such a cultural agreement about worrying about certain things, like money, for instance. Everyone - and it's understandable; I don't want to dismiss it or play it down, but it's almost like everyone is agreeing that we need to worry about money and investments, and have you got the right interest rate and portfolio and all this stuff. And it can be that one needs to actually be really firm with oneself about worry, and particularly things like money worry. Just, "I'm actually not going to do that. I'm really going to just cut it off. I'm going to practise <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="generosity" class="internal-link">generosity</a></span>, something that's going against that grain," because it has such an inner momentum and such a cultural momentum, and once we're swept up in that, it will eat away the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>. I'm not saying that's easy, but sometimes it's like a kind of firmness with ourself is really important<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > Worry eats away at joy" data-href="Joy (talk)#Worry eats away at joy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-1

So, eaten away by worry; by uncharitable inner attitudes. Envy, greed, or the opposite of this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">sympathetic joy</a></span> - sort of someone else achieves something or does something really well, and we say, "Yeah, good," but we're sort of a little bit putting them down. We can see ourselves doing this. It's so interesting just to watch these - they're just little movements, but they're so common, they're so repeated. We all have this. And can we just notice they're happening, and then just put the other movement in?

So, judging. Ten years, it must have been at least ten years ago when I was a composer. I had this piece performed in America. I was present at all the rehearsal processes with the orchestra, and such a sort of intense process of making sure everything was right, and every little note was exactly balanced with - you know, the oboe was balanced with the flute, and not too loud, and you got the exact rhythm right, and all this. And really, really intense, precise <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to detail, wanting it to be just right and just exactly what I had in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > Story composer for an orchestral piece" data-href="Joy (talk)#Story composer for an orchestral piece" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-3

The concert came, and sitting, listening to the concert with the same attitude of, you know, "Oh, okay, that was wrong, and that wasn't quite balanced." It was quite an unjoyful <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, actually, to sit basically on the edge of my seat, and [huffing and puffing], noting, making mental notes of all the little mistakes everyone made<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > Overly critical listening to the own piece" data-href="Joy (talk)#Overly critical listening to the own piece" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-4

Then a few days later, I went to visit some other friends who were musicians in New York. We just saw this advertisement for - it was an Arabic music concert in Brooklyn Public Library, and we just thought, "Cool, you know, let's go see that." And it was really long. It was like hours and hours. I think it was all day. And we went, and it was in a huge library. Different sort of acts would come on, and Arabic <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="poetry" class="internal-link">poetry</a></span>. Of course we didn't understand Arabic at all, whatever. But the scene was families and kids and picnics and grandmas, and lots of noise, and just a whole big scene together. And I remember sitting there and sort of taking in the whole <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> of the life unfolding. And of course what was very much absent was this critical, "Right. Wrong. That wasn't quite good enough," etc. And such <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> and delight and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a></span> of just the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> of humanity sort of coming together, and living, and life just manifesting<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > Contrast relaxed listening to an Arabic music concert" data-href="Joy (talk)#Contrast relaxed listening to an Arabic music concert" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-5

One huge part in nurturing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> is not overlooking it. This is really what I want to stress, because it can feel like it's a long way away. Not overlooking <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, not overlooking what it is that brings <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> and what there is to appreciate. We really need to recognize <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> and recognize what there is to appreciate. We can incline the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, incline where we put our intention, we can incline towards what brings <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>. So right here in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, and I think I spoke about this briefly in the opening talk, can we take care of our heart and our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> by actually deliberately inclining the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span> towards seeing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> here? There's a lot of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> here. Seeing what there is to appreciate here, seeing the goodness here.

The other day, I was just playing around with this. I was coming from somewhere, and I can't remember what it was, but I was a little bit irritated at something. I was driving, and I just said, "Okay, let me play with this." And driving along the road, and going one way, and of course the cars on the other side going the other way. I just reflected: how lovely that the other cars don't deliberately swerve into my car. [laughter] And I was, in a way, I was just being silly with it, but it actually really worked! It was quite interesting. I was really appreciating the fact that I can walk out there, I can drive out there, and of course bad things happen, and of course there are nasty people out there, of course. But actually, pretty much, on the whole, people are not that bad! [laughter] You can play with this stuff.

So, you know, people make their gardens beautiful. Just really small stuff; actually it's significant. The managers sometimes get this newspaper.

A friend, actually he died recently, but a friend I had was a psychotherapist, and he worked with many different kinds of clients. One group he worked with was addicts of different kinds, people with different kinds of addictions. And one of the ways he would work with addicts in particular, one of the pieces that he would do with them, was he would ask them to make an inventory of things they were grateful for. They would come every week, and he would say, "Here's a piece of paper. Come back and write [I've forgotten what it was] ten things or something that you're grateful for." Almost without exception the reaction was, "_Pff_! I'm not doing that. That's stupid!" And yet, often they _would_ do it, and would report, "Wow, what a difference that made!" And it's just this inclining the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> towards what we have to be grateful for. Huge is the power of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="gratitude" class="internal-link">gratitude</a></span>. And not just for addicts, obviously. [audio cuts out briefly at 46:21] And a lot of it is about having a buddy and touching base with them, I think every day even, and just saying to them one thing that you're grateful for that day, one thing that touched your heart, one thing that was appreciative.

One thing that becomes really significant in this is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> itself. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> said, a very significant quote, "Whatever one frequently dwells upon, that will become the inclination of the heart, the inclination of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>." To really reflect on the implications of that. If we dwell on <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, pay <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, it becomes the inclination of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. So when there is <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> (and the whole spectrum of what I'm talking about; please remember that - very undramatic, unremarkable-seeming, to the whole range of you're peeling yourself off the ceiling), how does it feel in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>? It's really, really significant. How does it feel in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>? So <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> actually does have a vibration in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, has a resonance there, reverberation. And if we can tune into that and just hold that in our attentiveness (remember, even if it's nothing particularly strong), just have a look, see what's there in the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>. How does the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> feel? But particularly, how does the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span> feel? And just tune into that vibration. It's a way that builds <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>. And through that, we become more and more familiar with that, more and more familiar with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>.

It goes on a journey of deepening<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > Attention to joy itself feeds joy" data-href="Joy (talk)#Attention to joy itself feeds joy" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-1

It's interesting, when there's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> there, to whatever degree, what feeds it and what doesn't. And I know for myself and many retreatants have come to me and reported, "There's so much <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> I feel like dancing." And oftentimes people _do._ Sometimes very early in the morning, no one else is up, and yogis are dancing down the corridor. If you get up early, you open your door, and you think you're on the set of _Strictly Come Dancing_ or whatever. [laughter] I'm exaggerating! But a person may really feel like, one tunes into it in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, and it actually feels like it wants to express. Or one's in the fields, and one just feels like wheeling and turning in the fields, and it's there and it wants to come out. Again, experiment with this if it's there and it feels strong. Move. See what that's like. What does that do to the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>? And then there's also the experiment with just really being still with it and letting it kind of grow, letting it build inside. So all this, there's a lot of experimentation with all of it. But the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to how it feels is really important<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > Experiment how joy can feel like" data-href="Joy (talk)#Experiment how joy can feel like" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-2

It's not based on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasure</a></span>. This is quite a significant point.

And so, rather than being hungry for it and sort of reliant on <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasure</a></span>, we can be open to the pleasure through the senses, but it's actually a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a></span> or mystery through the senses that we're tuning into more and more, rather than the aspect of it being pleasant or unpleasant, lovely taste or lovely this or that. There's something that's available through the senses different than pleasure, different than <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasure</a></span>, that's actually deeper and more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a></span>, that has to do with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a></span>.

We can develop this physical feeling of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span> - and again, this is talking about long-term practice now - by giving <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to it. It can seem like it comes out of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a></span> sometimes, and it does. That's true. But it also comes out of, or what it _really_ comes out of, is non-entanglement. When we're not entangled with what's going on, when there's openness, that allows <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, allows <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>. And it can be, it can come to the point where one really feels one has a choice with this. So something difficult goes on - I remember about a month after 9/11, and living in America, and the US Army invaded Afghanistan, and I felt really sad, saddened by that. But I had just been <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span> a while ago, and there was a lot of access to this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>.

There's that story of the frog that lives in the ocean, and he visits a frog that lives in a puddle. The frog in the puddle wants to say, you know, "Look at my puddle! It's pretty neat, isn't it?" And the ocean frog says, "Yeah ..." [laughter] And the puddle frog says, "Where do you live?" And he says, "Well, _pff_, you'd have to kind of come and check it out. I can't really explain."^[Coleman Barks, a translator of Rumi's works, first heard the story of the ocean frog from a teacher named Bawa Mahaiyaddeen, and further traces the story's origin not to Rumi but to a Taoist text by Chuang Tzu. See Coleman Barks, tr., _Rumi: Soul Fury: Rumi and Shams Tabriz on Friendship_ (New York: HarperOne, 2014), 7-8.] And it's a little bit like that.

So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> of things and our dependency on things can sound bleak, but I really don't think it is. How much <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a></span> is there in the world because one _believes_ I need something to be happy? It's not the fact that I don't have it; it's the fact that I _believe_ that I need it. In itself, it may not have anything to do with it. Very often, for example, money or relationship - there's so much hype about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="romantic love" class="internal-link">romantic love</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">in our culture</a></span>, and so a person who doesn't have that very often feels, "I need that."
