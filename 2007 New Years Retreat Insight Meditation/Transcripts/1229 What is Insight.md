[[What is Insight]]

---
<br/>

###### 1-1
_This talk presents a map and overview of [[Dharma|the path]] of [[Meditation|Insight Meditation]], exploring the different kinds and levels of [[insight]] available to us, the possible avenues for its development and deepening, and some of the many ways we can [[Cultivation|nurture]] and strengthen its unfolding._ ^1-1
###### 1-2
So the theme I would like to explore this evening is [[insight]]. Just to go into what that means. What is <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>? What does that mean when we talk about <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>, when we talk about [[Meditation|insight meditation]]? Very much what I want to do in this talk is give an overview, very much of an overview, so big, big picture. I want to offer some of the avenues of possibility for how <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span> deepens, and what that process is, can be - some of the possibilities. And to really give, what I want to do is to give a [[conceptual framework]]. So it's very much about just kind of putting things in place[[What is Insight#This talk is about putting things in place|.]] ^1-2
###### 1-3
Right from the start, I'm aware that there are, you could say, different [[personality types]], in terms of how people learn. And so for some people, having an overview, having a [[conceptual framework]] of how things fit together, and kind of what goes where, and how it all works together, they feel inside themselves that that's really necessary, and without that, they feel just totally disoriented on [[Dharma|the path]]. Other people, other <span class="transcript"><a data-href="personality types" href="personality+types" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personality types</a></span> or learning types, whatever, are actually confused when you start talking about an overview. So it's a tricky situation. [laughs] But this talk is an overview talk. And so I hope you can bear with that, if it's not your style[[What is Insight#Different personality types react differently to conceptual frameworks|.]] ^1-3
###### 1-4
I also want to cover a lot of territory tonight, so got about an hour. [laughs] Just go right from kind of the beginnings of [[Dharma|the path]], the most basic sort of ideas of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the path</a></span>, right all the way to the end, to the final kind of [[Insight|insights]]. And that, too, I'm also aware, again, of [[personality types]] here, and just how people respond to that. But please, do use this talk to get your bearings, in a sense, and have a sense of where you're navigating. But I'm well aware that some of what I talk about towards the end of the talk will be, as I said, about the sort of deep end of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the path</a></span>, and as such, will be not yet in the realm of probably most people's [[experience]] in this room. It _is_ in the realm of some people's <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience</a></span>; I know that. And just, what does the [[mind]] do when it hears that kind of stuff? Do we feel inspired? Do we feel daunted? Does the measuring, [[Mind|comparing mind]] come up? "Oh god, I'll never get there. I'm hopeless. I can't _da-da-da-da-da."_ And we compare where we feel we are to whatever we're hearing about. So just to, as I'm talking tonight, just to please be aware of how you're listening, what you're bringing to the listening[[What is Insight#Talking about the deep end of the path can feel daunting|.]] ^1-4
###### 1-5
Okay. [[Insight]] - this word, '[[insight]]': very, very general kind of definition we could give is, what is <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>? Any seeing or <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">understanding</a></span> that brings the dissolution or the dissolving or a decrease in [[Dukkha|suffering]], in <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissatisfaction</a></span>, in <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dis-ease</a></span>, in what we call [[dukkha]]. So any seeing or <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">understanding</a></span> that brings just an ease, some easing or completely dissolving of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dukkha</a></span> - that's what we call <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>. Now, that can happen intellectually, but if it's just an intellectual <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">understanding</a></span>, and it doesn't lead to this easing, this lessening of the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span>, it doesn't actually count or qualify as an <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>. So that applies - this "What is an <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>?," that which brings the lessening of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span> - it applies to any situation, and any [[experience]] whatsoever. Any situation, any <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience</a></span>, you can apply <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span> to, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span> is relevant. And the range is extreme - on one level, we could say, from the most mundane sort of everyday <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insights</a></span> that don't even feel like they have a lot to do with [[meditation]] or whatever, to the most subtle, and the most profound and - whatever you want to say - transcendent[[What is Insight#General definition of insight that which brings lessening of suffering|.]] ^1-5
###### 2-1
So an example of something that we could call more mundane or whatever, but very, very important, would be, I notice, you notice, we notice that when I have a difficulty with someone else, in relationship, whether I know that person or not, when I talk to them and express the difficulty I'm having, and I talk in an accusing way - "You _da-da-da-da-da_," and I tell that person how they are, usually there's an increase in [[Dukkha|suffering]]. Doesn't usually help. Occasionally it might, but usually it doesn't help to talk to a person that way. So just pulling any old basic example out of the hat. The [[insight]] there is, "Okay, if I want to actually address this and bring about a calming of the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span> in the situation, well, I need to not talk accusingly. I need to just refrain from trying to tell a person how they are." Just very, very basic, very, very simple - turns out to be quite difficult for a lot of us. But still, it's there. [5:52] ^2-1
###### 2-2
One of my teachers had a way of kind of conceptualizing of [[insight]], and talked about a possible [[Ways of Looking|way of looking]] at it. Three kinds of [[Insight|insights]]: **(1)** the **personal**, **(2)** the **universal**, and **(3)** the **ultimate**. There are three kinds, and in a way, they're separate. In a way, they're not so separate[[What is Insight#3 kinds of insights|.]] ^2-2
###### 2-3
**(1)** What does **[[Insight|personal insight]]** mean? What does it mean to have [[insight]] on a personal level? This means knowing, inquiring into and knowing one's own [[Habit|particular patterns]] and <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" href="Habit" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tendencies</a></span> and <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" href="Habit" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">habits</a></span> of [[Embodiment|body]], of speech, of [[mind]]. And again, this could be anything. So I have a friend, and in the context of her relationship, actually, with her husband, she notices - and this, I think she said this has been going on quite a while - that when her husband expresses a need, just a simple need like, "Oh, I'd like a cup of tea as well," or whatever, sometimes she doesn't even hear it. [laughter] It's not actually as big a problem as that might sound. It's just a little kind of niggle in their relationship. So they're both practitioners, and quite - to see that, to know that, is <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>. There's this <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" href="Habit" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particular pattern</a></span>. There's this particular tendency. And then, just to know that. So okay, that's an <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span> into, in this case, a personal situation[[What is Insight#Personal insight into one's own habits of body speech and mind|.]] ^2-3
###### 2-4
Or one might see, "In a situation of disagreement with another, my tendency is always to assume that I'm wrong and the other person is right, that I don't know. Or often to assume that." Or the other way around: "To assume I'm always right. I always know what's best. And they're always wrong. People don't see as clearly as I do." So all kinds of examples possible here. But the general thrust to really be alive in our inquiry into our personal [[Habit|tendencies]], <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" href="Habit" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">habits</a></span>, our personal kind of make-up. Not with any judgment. It's not about judging. It's just about, going back to the beginning, what I said, [[insight]] is about what frees us from [[dukkha]], frees us from [[Dukkha|dissatisfaction]], what helps - basically, what helps[[What is Insight#Be really alive in your inquiry into your personal tendencies|.]] ^2-4
###### 2-5
So this [[Insight|personal insight]] also includes: what are my particular weaknesses? What are my particular strengths? Now, this is an interesting one, because oftentimes, for many of us, we're more aware of our weaknesses than our strengths: "Oh, I can't do that. I haven't got that together." And then we hear teachings or whatever about [[Metta|loving-kindness]], and [[mindfulness]], and [[Steadiness|calmness]], and we think, "Well, I haven't got that, I haven't got that, I haven't got." And we're aware of the things that we don't have, our weaknesses. But are we also aware of our strengths? This is quite some, you could say, some [[psychological maturity]], to just know, "What do I need to work on? And what's actually pretty good with me?[[What is Insight#Be aware of both personal weaknesses and strenghts|"]] ^2-5
###### 3-1
So again, many examples here. A person could be - and I'm not saying they have to be one or the other here - but a person could have a lot of access to their emotional lives. They know what they're feeling. They're in touch with that. They're able to express that. They feel the fullness, the [[beauty]], the richness of that. And I'm not saying it follows from that at all, but they could have a particular weakness of, say, while that's there with the emotional life, not being so clear in situations - being, maybe, _too_ led by their [[emotions]]. (I'm really not saying those two go together.) Or the other way around: a person can be very clear, very analytical, and actually not have so much access to the depth and the richness of the life of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="emotions" href="emotions" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emotions</a></span>. Just to know: what's the weakness, what's the strength, what needs some work? What's a strength? Do we know, do we acknowledge and appreciate our strengths? Really, really important. [10:01] ^3-1
###### 3-2
So this, the realm of [[Insight|personal insight]], [[insight]] into our [[personhood]], our personality, so to speak, also includes the whole realm of [[Stories|our story]] - so the story that we tell ourselves, the [[stories]] that we tell ourselves and others about ourselves, about our life, about <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" href="Stories" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our journey</a></span>. So this is a very, very significant area. It can be - and I'm sure you know, just hearing <span class="transcript"><a data-href="stories" href="stories" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stories</a></span>, or [[Fantasy|mythological stories]], how beautiful <span class="transcript"><a data-href="stories" href="stories" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stories</a></span> can be, how touching, how opening, how, actually, revealing of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span> they can be. <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Stories" href="Stories" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stories</a></span> can be very, very beautiful. They can be helpful, absolutely they can be helpful. And they can be unhelpful. And so this inquiry, this <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>, this inquiry into our own story needs to ask this question: the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="stories" href="stories" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stories</a></span> that I'm telling myself about myself, about my life - are they helpful, or are they unhelpful? Is it helpful, or is it unhelpful[[What is Insight#Are the personal stories we tell ourselves helpful or unhelpful|?]] ^3-2
###### 3-3
It may well be that telling myself [[Stories|a certain story]] of my upbringing, of my childhood, of my journey, that through the telling of that story, I actually embrace aspects of myself, I open to aspects of myself that I otherwise might shut out. And the story's helping to open that. It's [[healing]]. It's reclaiming something. But it can also be, or it can be at a later time, that we get stuck in a story, stuck in telling ourselves a <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" href="Stories" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrative</a></span> or something about how we are, about where we've come from, etc. We get stuck and over-identified with that. This is a very difficult area, not easy to kind of navigate this and balance this and inquire into this. It's something that's actually, I think, important for all of us. I don't think anyone is exempt from this, this inquiry. Is the story helpful? And if so, how? And is it not helpful? And if so, how? And is it possible to actually tell myself a different story, to rewrite my story? And actually, yes, that is possible[[What is Insight#It's not easy to navigate and inquire into those stories|.]] ^3-3
###### 3-4
Any story we have of ourselves can never, even if it's very beautiful, even if it's very compelling, even if it seems completely obvious, it can never be the whole truth. There's no way. Truth as such is bigger than anything you can fit it into. A story, helpful as it might be, can never be the whole truth. And there comes a time, in a way - not that we get rid of a story, necessarily, but in a way, we know a [[freedom]] from [[Stories|our story]], as well as being able to pick it up[[What is Insight#No story can ever be the whole truth|.]] ^3-4
###### 3-5
Okay. As I said, I'm moving a lot of territory here, and you can just kind of sit back, and just hear about all this, really - the realm of [[Insight|personal insight]]. ^3-5
###### 3-6
**(2)** The realm of **[[Ultimate Truth|universal insights]]**. What these are are, rather than things that are particularly true for me (my [[Habit|tendencies]], my patterns, etc.), these are universally true, true for all things and all beings. So the most obvious example would be [[impermanence]]. It's just true for everyone and all things. It's a universal reality, we could say[[What is Insight#Universal insights pertain to all beings and all things|.]] ^3-6
###### 4-1
This is interesting. I'm going to talk more about [[Ultimate Truth|universal truths]], but the realm of [[Insight|personal truths]] and <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ultimate Truth" data-href="Ultimate Truth" href="Ultimate+Truth" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universal truths</a></span>, together, inquiring into that, deepening our [[insight]] into those whole realms of personal and <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ultimate Truth" data-href="Ultimate Truth" href="Ultimate+Truth" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universal truths</a></span>, personal and <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ultimate Truth" data-href="Ultimate Truth" href="Ultimate+Truth" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universal insights</a></span> - what that brings, what that can bring, what it should bring is that we are more and more, very gradually, very non-linearly, more and more able to be with, to open to, to respond skilfully, and to care for the [[Embodiment|world of our body]], to care, to respond for our <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" href="Embodiment" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">body</a></span>, to know our <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" href="Embodiment" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">body</a></span>, the [[Feelings|world of our feelings]], the [[Mind|world of our mind]], the [[Relationships|world of our relationships]]. What is it to respond well and to care in the realm of [[relationships]]? <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" href="Embodiment" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Body</a></span>, feeling, [[mind]], <span class="transcript"><a data-href="relationships" href="relationships" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relationships</a></span>, the realm of our work, etc. All that, personal and <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ultimate Truth" data-href="Ultimate Truth" href="Ultimate+Truth" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universal truths</a></span>, part of that function is to help us be able to relate well, to be with well, to respond well to all that realm - what we could call the realm of [[Conventional reality|relative truth]], [[conventional reality]], this world that it seems very obvious that we live in. I'm going to come back to that. And this really, really, really is a function of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>. Really, really, very much obviously a possibility of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>[[What is Insight#Personal and universal truths help us to respond well to conventional reality|.]] ^4-1
###### 4-2
**(3)** And then the third one, **[[ultimate truth]]**, and this refers to something that's actually beyond concepts, can't even pin it down with words, something totally beyond, that the [[Buddha]] said that's ultimately liberating. The level of [[Awakening|liberation]], of freeing, that comes out of that transcends any of the other [[Insight|insights]][[What is Insight#Ultimate truth is beyond words transcends any of the other|.]] ^4-2
###### 4-3
Question, question: am I, are we, in our life, giving equal [[attention]] to so-called working with [[Conventional reality|the relative]] and so-called opening to [[Ultimate Truth|the ultimate]]? Are they equal for us? Do we actually give equal <span class="transcript"><a data-href="attention" href="attention" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attention</a></span>, equal care of inquiry into that? I think this is very interesting. And you get - moving around in different [[spiritual circles]] over decades, one sees [[Habit|tendencies]] in different <span class="transcript"><a data-href="spiritual circles" href="spiritual+circles" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spiritual circles</a></span>. So there are some where the emphasis is very much towards [[ultimate truth]], and all kinds of problems in <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conventional reality" data-href="Conventional reality" href="Conventional+reality" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the relative</a></span>, and dealing with [[relationships]], and [[Embodiment|body]], and [[feelings]]. Other circles where it's almost exclusively concerned with <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conventional reality" data-href="Conventional reality" href="Conventional+reality" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the relative</a></span>, and kind of putting that, getting that right, [[healing]] that, putting it into place, getting it just so, so that we can be okay with it, getting our relationship with <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conventional reality" data-href="Conventional reality" href="Conventional+reality" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the relative</a></span> world okay, less problematic. Just a question about that: where am I with that[[What is Insight#Do we give equal attention to the conventional and the ultimate|?]] ^4-3
###### 4-4
A bit more about these [[Ultimate Truth|universal insights]]: another whole area of [[Insight|universal insight]] is something like, "It's a good idea to meditate." Very, very simple, and probably no one would be here if they at least didn't somewhat believe that. That's actually an [[insight]]. There's something there, as simple as it sounds, and sort of basic as it sounds: "It's a good idea to meditate. It's a good idea to practise." Again, seeing that, <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">understanding</a></span> that leads towards the dissolution of [[Dukkha|suffering]][[What is Insight#Another universal insight it's a good idea to practice|.]] ^4-4
###### 4-5
It's a good idea to take care of how we are with each other ethically, as Jake was talking very beautifully in the opening talk, to really care about that. It's a really, really good idea. This is an [[insight]], to really care what I put out into the world, the vibrations that I'm putting out there, what's reverberating in my wake. It's a good idea - we could put anything like that - to practise [[generosity]]. That's an interesting one. We sort of know it, but it's also like, do we really know that that's where [[happiness]] is? Do we really know what a good idea that is? The [[Buddha]]'s famous quote: "If you knew what I know about <span class="transcript"><a data-href="generosity" href="generosity" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generosity</a></span>, you wouldn't let a single meal go by without giving something to someone." Yet we don't actually know that fully. The <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span> hasn't sunk deeply for most of us yet[[What is Insight#It's a good idea to practice generosity|.]] ^4-5
###### 5-1
It's a good idea to meditate. It's a good idea to take care of our [[ethics]]. [[Generosity]], it's a good idea. [[Metta|Kindness]] is a good idea. It's a beautiful idea. All that is in the realm of [[insight]]. So what that means is, what is it, what qualities, what actions do I need to put into place, that lead to [[happiness]], that lead to [[Pleasantness|well-being]]? What actions/qualities do I [[Cultivation|cultivate]] that actually lead to [[Dukkha|suffering]]? Disinterest in the care of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="ethics" href="ethics" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ethics</a></span>, non-practising of [[generosity]] - actually not that helpful. So these are, all of that, in the realm of [[Ultimate Truth|universal insights]], they're not one-off [[Insight|insights]]. They're not, in other words, we see it once, and then, "Well, that's that. Done." We need to see this over and over and over and over and over, until finally the coin drops, and seeing it over and over, and practising it, it deepens. The <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span> deepens, and it becomes unshakeable[[What is Insight#What qualities do I need to cultivate that actually lead to a lessening of suffering|.]] ^5-1
###### 5-2
How common is it for a person, a [[Personhood|human being]], to have [[Insight|unshakeable knowing]], <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">understanding</a></span>, [[Devotion|faith]] in, let's say, the power of [[generosity]]? So much so that that becomes something that they live by, above self-concern? Actually it's pretty rare, as far as I can see. But the potential there is, through the repeating of the [[insight]], seeing it over and over, it descends to become unshakeable. Something like the importance of [[Meditation|meditation practice]], for many people, that's unshakeable. It's got to the point, through repetition, through seeing it over and over, through all the ups and downs, where it's an unshakeable <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>. ^5-2
###### 5-3
We can talk, in the process of [[Dharma|the path]], as we walk <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the path</a></span>, wherever we are on <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the path</a></span>, wherever we are, we can talk about [[Insight|insights]] arising. We say, "I _had_ an [[insight]]," or "I _got_ an <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>. I _got_ something." And so, one very common approach to <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the path</a></span> is just to [[Cultivation|cultivate]] the [[mindfulness]], just to be steady in one's [[attention]] to, one's presence to the [[present moment]], and just trust that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mindfulness" href="mindfulness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mindfulness</a></span>. And of course the [[mind]] goes, and we bring it back, and it goes, and we bring it back. Something can potentially happen through just devoting oneself to <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mindfulness" href="mindfulness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mindfulness</a></span>, to presence, to being here fully. And in the climate of that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mindfulness" href="mindfulness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mindfulness</a></span>, even if it doesn't feel like great <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mindfulness" href="mindfulness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mindfulness</a></span>, perfect <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mindfulness" href="mindfulness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mindfulness</a></span> - whatever that is - even if it doesn't feel like that, "Oh! Some <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>." Again, over the whole range, could be very, very simple, to do with anything, mundane, whatever. So <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span> arises[[What is Insight#"Insights arise" often from trusting mindfulness|.]] ^5-3
###### 5-4
More traditionally, the [[Buddha]] talks about taking care of the foundation for [[insight]] through taking care of our [[ethics]], and taking care of our [[Steadiness|calmness]], deepening in our <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" href="Steadiness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calmness</a></span> and our [[Samadhi|collectedness of mind]], our <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" href="Samadhi" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">samādhi</a></span>. Those two - the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="ethics" href="ethics" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ethics</a></span> and the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" href="Samadhi" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">samādhi</a></span> - give rise. It's like they're the perfect soil, and [[Insight|insights]] arise[[What is Insight#Taking care of insight through taking care of ethics and samadhi|.]] ^5-4
###### 5-5
So there's, we can say, [[Insight|insights]] _arising_, and then another mode, which is what I would call _using_ <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insights</a></span> or _consolidating_ <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" href="Insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insights</a></span>. I'll try and explain what I mean by this. Sometimes in our practice, whether [[Retreat|on retreat]] or off [[retreat]], we see something. Could be anything. I see the importance to imbue my communications with [[Metta|kindness]]. I see the importance of [[letting go]] of judgmentalism, whatever it is. We see that, and it feels really clear. Or we see [[impermanence]], and it feels really clear: "I see it. Everything's changing." And we see it crystal clear: "Aha!" Sometimes, it's done there. It's finished, done, that's it, you can retire that [[insight]] and just live off its interest in the inner bank. Usually, though, it takes some acting on. You actually need to consolidate it[[What is Insight#"Insights arising" vs "using insights"|.]] ^5-5
###### 5-6
So we have this great clarity, whether it's [[Retreat|on retreat]] or whatever it is. I see the importance of being more kind to myself - whatever it is. And then, a little time goes by, and that [[insight]] fades. We lose touch with that [[perception]]. We feel like we're back where we were. Very important: to consolidate, to deepen the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>, actually needs, very often, us to _act_ on it. So even when the sense of it, the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="perception" href="perception" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perception</a></span> has changed, one asks oneself, "I don't feel it right now. But I remember having that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>. What if I acted now? What if I chose now in my life as if I knew that was true, because I know what I saw there was more true than all this, whatever seems real now? I know that what I saw about the importance of [[love]] or [[impermanence]] or whatever it is - I know that was true. I don't feel it now. What if I took a risk and just acted on [[Devotion|faith]], made a choice, made choices that lived out that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>?" In other words, how we are with people and things, with ourselves, etc[[What is Insight#To consolidate the insight needs us to act on it|.]] ^5-6
###### 6-1
Very often, we have an [[insight]], but it actually leaves us kind of sitting on a fence. And we can flop back down into the familiar, and the known, and the momentum of our [[Habit|habits]] from the past, or we can just nudge ourselves and flop down into the new, into a life lived from the place of that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>. That may look dramatically different. It may look dramatically different. What if one had really deep <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span> into, say, the power of [[love]], the importance of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">love</a></span>, the importance of [[generosity]], and then just said, "Right, I'm really going to live that out"? It could be something very, very undramatic. [[Insight]] is a bit like a muscle. If we don't use it, it will atrophy. It will atrophy and [[Emptiness|fade]]. [26:27] We need to kind of keep it alive, to consolidate it[[What is Insight#Insight is like a muscle if we don't use it it will atrophy|.]] ^6-1
###### 6-2
So there's this, as I said, [[insight]] arising, just arising out of [[mindfulness]]. And there's also this acting on, using and consolidating. But there's another way that we can use and consolidate an <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>. And that's, rather, using <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span> as a kind of mode of seeing. Remember, what I'm doing tonight is I'm just creating [[Conceptual Framework|conceptual frameworks]]. I'm hoping this is helpful. A mode of seeing. I'll explain what I mean by that. What would it be - say, [[impermanence]] - to, rather than just wait for a sense of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impermanence</a></span> and the ricochets of that, the reverberations of that, what would it be to actually look at one's [[experience]], just being interested in <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impermanence</a></span>? Put that on as a lens, a [[Ways of Looking|way of seeing]], as a practice. So this is moving beyond what we might call simple <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mindfulness" href="mindfulness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mindfulness</a></span> or simple presence or being, and actually deliberately taking up a certain mode of seeing, a certain <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of Looking" data-href="Ways of Looking" href="Ways+of+Looking" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">way of looking</a></span> at <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience</a></span>, for a period of time - a sitting, or half a sitting, or a day, or you know, a [[retreat]], or whatever it is, or a year[[What is Insight#Another way to consolidate the insight is to use it as a mode of seeing|.]] ^6-2
###### 6-3
I'll talk more about this, but we can talk then about [[insight]] as a kind of result, just sitting, being here, and just present, and just open, and there pops the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>. Can talk about <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span> as a result. And we can talk about <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span> as - I can't really find the words - a process of using <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>. I'll go into it a bit more. But both of these are important. And again, it's interesting, just in the realm of maybe [[Personality types|personality differences]], etc., where we tend to go with that. So some people always want to just _be_, and just let things arise, and some people are always kind of probing and trying to look differently, or a tendency either way. Both are important, and I would say, maybe not just one way. Maybe not just one way[[What is Insight#Insight as result vs insight as a process|.]] ^6-3
###### 6-4
But with this '[[Ways of Looking|modes of seeing]]' - and I'm going to go, as I said, more into it right now - we can think, if you hear about that, "Okay, putting on a different lens. I'm looking at things through the lens of, say, [[impermanence]], or whatever." We can think, "Well, I'm not really, I haven't really got my [[mindfulness]] together, can't really stay with the [[breath]]. I'm not really together enough, got all these [[emotions]] going on, not ready for that." Or, "I just want to be. I just want to be." And these are two quite common reactions to hearing about this possibility. But actually, looking at things through certain <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of Looking" data-href="Ways of Looking" href="Ways+of+Looking" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modes of seeing</a></span> as [[insight]] actually calms the being. It helps emotionally. It helps bring some [[Steadiness|calmness]] and [[Samadhi|collectedness]] to the [[mind]]. So it's not just that we need to stay with the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="breath" href="breath" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breath</a></span> or whatever until we feel suitably calm[[What is Insight#Looking at things through certain modes of seeing as insight calms the being|.]] ^6-4
###### 7-1
Okay, so a bit more about this. Ways, [[Ways of Looking|modes of seeing]], [[ways of looking]] - what do I mean by this? One of the sort of most fundamental ways the [[Buddha]] framed his teaching was in terms of the [[Four Noble Truths]], which I'm sure many of you have heard. There is [[dukkha]], there is [[Dukkha|suffering]], <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dis-ease</a></span>, <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissatisfaction</a></span>. There is <span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dukkha</a></span>. There are the [[Dependent Origination|causes and conditions]] of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dukkha</a></span>. There is the possibility for the ending, for the cessation of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dukkha</a></span>, of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dis-ease</a></span>, of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissatisfaction</a></span>. It's possible for that to end. And there is [[Dharma|the path]] leading to it. So in a way, that's a summary of the whole path. But you could also pick it up as a kind of shorthand, shorthand version of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Four Noble Truths" href="Four+Noble+Truths" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Four Noble Truths</a></span>[[What is Insight#The Four Noble Truths|.]] ^7-1
###### 7-2
What that means is, whenever there is any [[Dukkha|dissatisfaction]] at all, any <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dis-ease</a></span>, any discomfort, any [[dukkha]], basically, any <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span>, any at all, can ask oneself a question: how am I contributing to this <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span>? How am I perhaps even sustaining it? At first that might sound like an odd question, because some sufferings that we're in, "This has nothing to do with me. I'm an innocent victim of this illness, of this situation, of this political situation, whatever it is." And it's not to ignore the importance of all that. But it's a safe assumption that, until we're completely awakened, whenever there is <span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dukkha</a></span>, whenever there's even the subtlest <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dis-ease</a></span>, discomfort, that the [[Samadhi|unawakened mind]] does something or some things to add to it unnecessarily. It's actually compounding <span class="transcript"><a data-href="dukkha" href="dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dukkha</a></span>, compounding <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissatisfaction</a></span>[[What is Insight#Whenever there is dukkha the unawakened mind does something unnecessary to itself|.]] ^7-2
###### 7-3
Again, whole range of examples, but one is something like grumbling. So we're in a situation, we're annoyed with someone or something. Dharmically speaking, we have two options, really. One is, can I find a way of working with this that actually I let go? The situation remains, and I [[Letting go|just let go]]. I've let go inside. Or, can I do something to address the situation? Can I bring a [[Insight|wisdom]], a skilfulness of communication, a care of communication to this person that I'm upset with? And can I solve the situation that way, or do something, make some changes in the world that are skilful and appropriate? So either I let go or I do something. Unfortunately, oftentimes, we find ourselves just, neither this nor that, and just sitting there grumbling to people who are sort of willing to hear. Grumbling is not helpful. It's actually leading to more [[Dukkha|suffering]]. It's a very obvious example, in a way, and a crass example, but it's important to see this. What am I doing that's actually compounding <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span>, adding a layer of unnecessary <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span> there[[What is Insight#Example grumbling|?]] ^7-3
###### 7-4
Again, the story that I'm telling myself about the situation, about myself, whatever, is that increasing the [[Dukkha|suffering]] in some way? Is that increasing the sense of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissatisfaction</a></span>? The way I'm seeing it, the way I'm reacting to it - if I have a [[Pain|headache]], a knee ache, and I react to it with [[aversion]], I react to it with, "I just want to get rid of it," pushing it away, am I increasing the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span>? Yes[[What is Insight#Is the story I'm telling myself increasing dukkha|.]] ^7-4
###### 7-5
Now, sometimes, as I'm sure you'll recognize as I've just said that, sometimes we know we're doing this stuff. We actually know. We know that we're grumbling and it's not helping. It's not _that_ deep an [[insight]]. But somehow we just keep doing it. This is the interesting thing about <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span>. What is it that's going to make the change? There's no judgment in this question, because as I said, until one is completely awakened, you can pretty much safely assume that the [[mind]] will be adding something to a situation that feels difficult, adding some unnecessary [[Dukkha|suffering]] to it - guaranteed. Some of it is going to be pretty gross and fairly easy to uncover. Others, it's extremely subtle - so to the most subtle kind of intentions and conceptions, delusions of [[awareness]][[What is Insight#Be aware of subtle kind of delusions of awareness|.]] ^7-5
###### 7-6
Okay. So this [[Ways of Looking|modes of seeing]] - one is, how am I adding to the [[Dukkha|suffering]]? How am I perhaps contributing to it, sustaining it? Without judgment - it's just what [[consciousness]] does, actually. The [[Buddha]] talked about three <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of Looking" data-href="Ways of Looking" href="Ways+of+Looking" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modes of seeing</a></span> in particular that we can practise deliberately. And they're called the [[three characteristics]]. They are: [[impermanence]], <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dukkha/unsatisfactoriness</a></span>, and what's called [[Anatta|anattā]], <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" href="Anatta" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not-self</a></span>. I'll just say a little bit about these[[What is Insight#The Three Characteristics are modes of seeing which add to suffering|.]] ^7-6
###### 8-1
**(1) [[Impermanence]]**, the first one, I don't know if you would agree, but I would say that to most human beings over the age of - what, I don't know, four, or five? I'm not sure - [[impermanence]] is actually pretty obvious. It's a pretty obvious fact of our life. Remember, if we're interested in [[insight]], it's got to make a difference. It's got to make a difference to how we relate and how we live. So yes, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impermanence</a></span> is obvious. But are we seeing it in a way that makes a difference? Using this mode of seeing - actually just coming out of that very lovely mode of just being [[Mindfulness|mindful]]. I maybe skipped over that too quickly. Something very beautiful, very precious, and extremely important about just giving [[attention]], just coming back, just being here, just being <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mindful</a></span>, devoting oneself to that. A real preciousness and [[beauty]] in that way of being, way of practising, and trusting that out of that, the [[Insight|insights]] will come. I really want to stress that[[What is Insight#Impermanence is an obvious fact but are we seeing it in a way that makes a difference|.]] ^8-1
###### 8-2
But what would it be if we picked up [[impermanence]], instead of waiting for the [[insight]] into <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impermanence</a></span> - "Aha! I've been [[Mindfulness|mindful]], and now I notice things are [[Impermanence|impermanent]]"? What would it be to actually take up <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impermanence</a></span> as a lens, so that one's being <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mindful</a></span>, but all I'm interested in is noticing <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impermanence</a></span>? All I care about in this sitting, in this day, in this next three months, all I care about is noticing <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impermanence</a></span>. Can be very powerful. [37:29] ^8-2
###### 8-3
[[Impermanence]] - there are many ways of working with it, so oftentimes, what gets stressed is very, very microscopic noticing of [[impermanence]], moment to moment to moment, just seeing change, change, change, very, very fast. Or one can just go through one's day. And you can do that here, so there's an invitation: what would it be to get up tomorrow morning, and just say, "This day, I'm really going to focus in on change"? You take up - the [[Buddha]]'s words - you take up your theme. And one sees the change in the visual forms. Look: visual form, changing. It's just changing. All through the day, changing visual form, all through the day, changing emotional climate, all through the day. Do I go to bed in the same mood as I got up? Has it stayed the same all day? All through the day, changing [[Embodiment|body sensations]], changing sounds. Right now, the sounds are changing. Just going through and just focusing on <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impermanence</a></span> so that the fact of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impermanence</a></span> begins to impress itself deeply, deeply on the [[consciousness]]. And we begin more and more to be able to live that way. [38:38] ^8-3
###### 8-4
If you try this - again, it's an invitation - at some point in your path, if you try this, you will see that contemplating that way should bring a [[letting go]], should bring an ease, should bring a sense of [[freedom]] and [[Happiness|joy]]. If we [[Impermanence|contemplate impermanence]] in the right way, it brings <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" href="Happiness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joy</a></span>. So you're actually using it in the moment as a way of [[Freedom|feeling into freedom]], of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" href="Freedom" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opening up into freedom</a></span>. It's a [[Ways of Looking|way of seeing]], a <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of Looking" data-href="Ways of Looking" href="Ways+of+Looking" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">way of looking</a></span>[[What is Insight#You contemplate impermance in the right way it brings joy|.]] ^8-4
###### 8-5
And of course, there's the [[Death|reflection on death]]. All this, all this now is in the context of our [[death]]. We are born at a certain date. We die at a certain date. Can we see this moment in that context? Doesn't have to be morbid. Can actually liberate a lot of [[freedom]], a lot of [[Happiness|joy]], a lot of [[love]][[What is Insight#Reflection on death|.]] ^8-5
###### 8-6
So sometimes, and particularly with the [[Impermanence|impermanence contemplation]], you read in the [[commentaries]] - not actually originally what the [[Buddha]] said, but you read in the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="commentaries" href="commentaries" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commentaries</a></span> that if one contemplates [[impermanence]], one will start getting really freaked out, and really upset, and really agitated, and disgusted with life, and horrified, and very afraid, etc. I don't think that's how [[insight]] works. I think, going back to right what I said at the beginning, the mark of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="insight" href="insight" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insight</a></span> is that it brings a sense of [[freedom]]. It brings of sense of [[Happiness|joy]]. So I'm talking about [[Ways of Looking|modes of seeing]] that we can pick up and use, that lead to a sense of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="freedom" href="freedom" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freedom</a></span>. [40:18] If they lead to a sense of agitation or confusion existentially, or all the rest of it, torment - wrong! Put it away! Do something else. So if we <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" href="Impermanence" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contemplate impermanence</a></span>, to ask oneself: am I contemplating it in a way that's actually helpful, that's leading to <span class="transcript"><a data-href="freedom" href="freedom" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freedom</a></span>, to that sense? Okay, so there's <span class="transcript"><a data-href="impermanence" href="impermanence" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impermanence</a></span>. There's the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" href="Impermanence" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first characteristic</a></span>, the first mode of seeing[[What is Insight#Commentaries point towards a "dark night of the soul" but I don't think that's how insight works|.]] ^8-6
###### 9-1
**(2)** The second one is what's called _**[[dukkha]]**_, this [[Dukkha|unsatisfactoriness]] of things. All this can sound very depressing. Again, really, really want to stress: they lead to [[freedom]]. If we pick them up, if we use them in the right way, they lead to [[Happiness|joy]], peace, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="freedom" href="freedom" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freedom</a></span>, etc. If things are [[Impermanence|impermanent]], if things are always changing, they cannot give us lasting satisfaction. And so one can, again, put on a mode of seeing for a sitting, a day, a month, a year. What if I saw everything as unsatisfactory? Just things come into [[consciousness]], any [[experience]], anything at all - just regard it as unsatisfactory. It's not a loathing or an [[aversion]]. Just saying, "Ah! It can't satisfy me." What happens is there's a [[letting go]]. There's a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="letting go" href="letting+go" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letting go</a></span>. So I said, moving through a lot of territory here[[What is Insight#Seeing things as unsatisfactory|.]] ^9-1

Another aspect of this [[dukkha]] [[insight]] or mode of seeing is actually learning - and we'll probably talk about this tomorrow morning - learning to uncouple, to relax the [[aversion]] or the [[Craving|grasping]] that we have to our [[experience]], and to things that come up. So typically, something comes up, and it's pleasant, and we grab on. We grasp. We hold on. We want to keep it. Something comes up that's unpleasant, and we [[Aversion|push it away]]. We're <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" href="Aversion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">averse to it</a></span>. One can become more and more sensitive to that movement of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" href="Aversion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushing away</a></span> and hanging on, and learn how to relax it, learn how to let go. [42:27] That's very much a practice. All this is practice. So as I said, I'm outlining some possibilities for practice over the very long term[[What is Insight#Learn to relax the push and the pull|.]] ^9-2
###### 9-3
One can practise [[letting go]]. And one will see that if I let go of [[Craving|the push and the pull]], less [[Dukkha|suffering]] in the [[experience]], guaranteed. If I let go of the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" href="Craving" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">push and pull</a></span>, there's less <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span>. One notices the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span>, the problem, go out of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience</a></span>. And again, we can use that. We can consolidate that. Just take that, put that on as a lens, as a way of relating to <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience</a></span> in a moment, in a sitting, in a walking, whatever it is, and just use it, and use it, and deepen it, consolidate it. See the [[insight]]: the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span> comes from the relationship, <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" href="Craving" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the push, the pull</a></span>. It's not in the object itself. It's not in the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience</a></span> itself[[What is Insight#Just take the way of seeing as a lens and use deepen consolidate it|.]] ^9-3
###### 9-4
**(3)** Third one is this **[[Anatta|not-self]]**. So I'm really not going to go into this in a big way, but just to say, that's also a mode of seeing. And with practice, there's the possibility: instead of identifying with everything that comes up, identify with my [[Embodiment|body sensations]], identify with my [[emotions]], "They're me," or "They're mine," identify with my thoughts, "They're me," or "They're mine," one learns to practise [[letting go]], <span class="transcript"><a data-href="letting go" href="letting+go" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letting go</a></span> of identification, regarding things as <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" href="Anatta" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not-self</a></span>. Again, it's a lens that one puts on, this <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" href="Anatta" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not-self</a></span>. It's not me, not mine. And in that, there's a <span class="transcript"><a data-href="letting go" href="letting+go" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letting go</a></span>, a very beautiful <span class="transcript"><a data-href="letting go" href="letting+go" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letting go</a></span>. It's not at all about disconnection, or dissociation, or numbing out, or anything like that. It's practising a mode of seeing, a certain lens. Everything that comes up, can we practise with that way[[What is Insight#Seeing things as not-self|?]] ^9-4
###### 9-5
Earlier today, I feel like I'm also getting ill in some manner. And there was a [[Pain|headache]], and I was sitting. And this goes back to this [[Craving|push and pull]] thing. I just want to drop this in there as a little titbit. What happens - the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pain" data-href="Pain" href="Pain" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">headache</a></span> comes up. Natural, or you could say, normal reaction of [[consciousness]] is to want to [[Aversion|push it away]]. Want to get rid of this <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pain" data-href="Pain" href="Pain" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">headache</a></span>, quite intense, unpleasant. I've seen this before, but found that if I work with just relaxing the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" href="Aversion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushing away</a></span>, just opening, just allowing, relaxing the [[aversion]], [[love]] came. [[Love]] came. The <span class="transcript"><a data-href="aversion" href="aversion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aversion</a></span> was actually blocking a sense of [[Metta|mettā]], of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" href="Metta" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loving-kindness</a></span>, of warmth, of openness. So again, one could take that up, and use that as a way to practise <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" href="Metta" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mettā</a></span>. I just sit here, and I [[Letting go|just let go]] of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="aversion" href="aversion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aversion</a></span>, and the heart - again, you can see this; you can experiment with this in your practice, over the years, really - lets go of <span class="transcript"><a data-href="aversion" href="aversion" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aversion</a></span>, and the warmth comes. The heart opens. More <span class="transcript"><a data-href="love" href="love" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">love</a></span> comes. [50:00] So all these [[three characteristics]], we see, if we practise them as [[Ways of Looking|modes of seeing]], they absolutely lead to a sense of less [[Dukkha|suffering]]. The <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span> just drains out. That's really, really important to see, to see the skilfulness of seeing that way, to develop the skill of seeing that way[[What is Insight#Just letting go of the aversion in the heart the heart opens|.]] ^9-5
###### 10-1
But something else happens. It's actually quite significant, as we go now, talking about the sort of very deep end of [[Dharma|the path]] - as I said, just to give you a sense, an overview. If one keeps practising with these [[Ways of Looking|modes of seeing]], [[letting go]], <span class="transcript"><a data-href="letting go" href="letting+go" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letting go</a></span> of the [[Craving|push and pull]], <span class="transcript"><a data-href="letting go" href="letting+go" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letting go</a></span>, seeing [[impermanence]] over and over, regarding things as [[Anatta|not-self]]. The [[Dukkha|suffering]] goes, but [[experience]] itself begins to [[Emptiness|fade]] a little bit, or a lot. To the degree that we let go, <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience</a></span> fades[[What is Insight#To the degree we let go experience fades|.]] ^10-1
###### 10-2
So let's backtrack a little bit. When we talk about [[mindfulness]], we often talk about: is it possible to be with something, as I said, I think the first morning, just in a very bare way, just really meet the [[experience]] as it is, and not overlay it with a whole bunch ... [audio cut out for about twenty seconds] Just doing that, just being present, just being [[Mindfulness|mindful]], [[letting go]] of [[Papanca|papañca]], <span class="transcript"><a data-href="letting go" href="letting+go" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letting go</a></span> of this <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" href="Papanca" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proliferation</a></span>, this tendency to sort of get over-entangled and blow things up. The more we can just meet things with a very, very simple, basic, beautiful <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mindfulness" href="mindfulness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mindfulness</a></span>, just there, what we find - and this is a very common <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience</a></span>, as many of you will know, and others will probably discover as the days go by - what we find is, our <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience</a></span> begins to brighten. So, literally, people say, "The grass seems more green. The sky seems more blue. I'm just hearing more clearly. I'm seeing more clearly." There's a kind of radiance that begins to come into one's <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience</a></span>, the more that we're able to meet it in a very direct, very simple, bare way - <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mindfulness" href="mindfulness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mindfulness</a></span> and [[Attention|bare attention]][[What is Insight# the more we let go of papanca the more our experience begins to brighten|.]] ^10-2
###### 10-3
And it can be that through that, we keep deepening that [[mindfulness]], we're actually [[letting go]] of anything else, and there's just this sense of this moment, and the [[beauty]], the exquisite <span class="transcript"><a data-href="beauty" href="beauty" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beauty</a></span> of this moment - just the now. And it can even seem to be sparkling. Like the sense of now, the sense of sparkling there. It's a very lovely aspect of [[Dharma|the path]] that's available to us. It has a real intimacy with [[experience]], an intimacy with life. That's very much a fruit of this simple <span class="transcript"><a data-href="mindfulness" href="mindfulness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mindfulness</a></span>, and <span class="transcript"><a data-href="letting go" href="letting+go" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letting go</a></span> of [[Papanca|papañca]], <span class="transcript"><a data-href="letting go" href="letting+go" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letting go</a></span> of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" href="Papanca" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proliferation</a></span>, of story and all that[[What is Insight#Letting go makes the now sparkle|.]] ^10-3
###### 10-4
But it can be, then, that we feel like this moment and that radiance, immanence of things, is the reality, is the absolute truth of things, the only real thing. We hear this word [[Emptiness#Suchness|suchness]], and it's come to actually mean something which it didn't originally mean: "<span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness > Suchness" data-href="Emptiness#Suchness" href="Emptiness#Suchness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suchness</a></span> is just the way it exactly is in this moment, without my layers of [[Papanca|papañca]] and preconception" - that's not actually what it quite means. So there's something very, very beautiful here, and just coming very simply, very directly, very nakedly with the [[mindfulness]]. Beautiful, beautiful aspect of being [[Mindfulness|mindful]]. [49:53] ^10-4
###### 10-5
But don't stop there. Don't stop there. If we keep [[letting go]] - and I'm talking about the deep end of [[Dharma|the path]] there - if we keep <span class="transcript"><a data-href="letting go" href="letting+go" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letting go</a></span>, keep learning to let go through these [[Ways of Looking|ways of seeing]] that I'm talking about, we find that here, I was just being there, and the [[experience]] was getting more and more bright, more and more there, more and more present, more and more radiant. But if I keep <span class="transcript"><a data-href="letting go" href="letting+go" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letting go</a></span>, it actually begins to [[Emptiness|fade]]. [[Experience]] itself begins to blur and dissolve and <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" href="Emptiness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fade</a></span> and become less prominent in [[consciousness]]. Something very, very interesting happening here[[What is Insight#When you don't stop there experience begins to fade|!]] ^10-5
###### 11-1
The [[Buddha]] once said to practitioners, "Be someone who tears down the [[Skandhas|aggregates]]" - so the <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" href="Skandhas" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggregates</a></span> means the [[Embodiment|body]], the [[emotions]], the [[mind]], [[consciousness]], the feeling life, thoughts, etc. Be someone who tears that all down. That sounds really destructive. What does it mean to tear that down, to be someone who tears that down? Exact words: tear it down. But if we do that, if we follow this way, this mode of seeing, eventually, all that, all that in the realm of [[experience]] begins to, in a way, [[Emptiness|fade]], more and more and more, to the degree that we're able to let go in these ways. And we move, you could say, on one level, we move towards knowing what is [[Unfabricated]], <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Unfabricated" data-href="Unfabricated" href="Unfabricated" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unborn</a></span>. The <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Buddha" href="Buddha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buddha</a></span> says - beautiful quote: "Where all [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] cease" - there's this complete <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" href="Emptiness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fading</a></span>; where all <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phenomena</a></span> cease - "all ways of speaking cease."^[Sn 5:6] Where all <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phenomena</a></span> cease, when there's been this complete <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" href="Emptiness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fading</a></span>, all ways of speaking cease[[What is Insight#Moving towards the Unfabracticated|.]] ^11-1
###### 11-2
This is - and I'm talking about the very, very deep end of [[Dharma|the path]] - this is an interesting one. How does the heart respond to that? Oftentimes our sense of practice and life is very much, of course, to do with _all this._ What would it be to tear that down? How does that sound? It goes beyond our sense of actually what life is. So we could spend a whole <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Dharma" href="Dharma" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dharma</a></span> talk on that one. I'm not going to[[What is Insight#How does the heart respond to this "tearing down the skandhas"|.]] ^11-2
###### 11-3
The [[Buddha]] says, in the [[Satipatthana Sutta|Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta]], which is one of the discourses that this practice, [[Meditation|insight meditation]], is most based on, there's a refrain that keeps coming back, and he says: "Focus on arising and passing away with regard to [[Phenomenon|phenomena]], seeing: 'Such is [[Embodiment|body]], such is form, such is feeling, such is [[perception]], such is mental formations, such is [[consciousness]]. Such is its origination, and such is its dissolution.'"^[DN 22] So, strange language. What it really means is, see _how_ it comes up and _how_ it fades. It's not pointing to only noticing that it's [[Impermanence|impermanent]]. As I said, actually that's fairly obvious on one level. It's pointing to seeing this: the more I [[Clinging|cling]] in any way, the more prominent [[experience]] is in <span class="transcript"><a data-href="consciousness" href="consciousness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consciousness</a></span>. I begin to understand _how_ things arise and _how_ they [[Emptiness|fade]]. He said that if you follow that line of inquiry, that line of [[insight]], it leads to complete [[Awakening|liberation]]. [53:31] ^11-3
###### 11-4
So what one sees is that the more entanglement, the more the [[Craving|push and pull]], the more the fighting with [[experience]], the more prominent that <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience</a></span> is. You can see this when there's a lot of story, a lot of entanglement, how big that thing seems in [[consciousness]], whatever it is. Let go a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, and the thing fades. For example, a [[pain]] in the knee, you can see it. Or [[letting go]] of [[Dukkha|suffering]]: <span class="transcript"><a data-href="letting go" href="letting+go" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letting go</a></span> of identification actually leads to a [[Emptiness|fading]] of the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience</a></span>. The more that's there, the more [[clinging]] is there, the more the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience</a></span> is there. Less it's there, less the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="experience" href="experience" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience</a></span> is there. This is completely counterintuitive, totally and utterly counterintuitive. We tend to believe in a world that's out there, that exists independent of how I relate to it and look at it[[What is Insight#The more entanglement with experience the more prominent it is|.]] ^11-4
###### 11-5
One could ask - okay, so I see, the more I [[Craving|push and pull]], the more entangled I am, the more prominent the world appears. The less, the less. And as it gets less and less, less and less prominent the world appears. And when there's no pushing/pulling at all, no [[experience]] arises. And one might ask, "Well, which amount of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" href="Craving" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushing and pulling</a></span> reveals the real way the world is?" Can't actually find it. The [[Buddha]] said the [[nature]] of things is that they dependently arise. So we can develop - as I said at the beginning - avenues, avenues of possibility on [[Dharma|the path]]. One is to develop these [[Ways of Looking|modes of seeing]]. They actually develop from those [[three characteristics]] into other ones. And you can pick them up and just go further, go deeper. And it's all available for us[[What is Insight#There is no _one_ amount of craving which reveals how the world is|.]] ^11-5
###### 12-1
One eventually - if we talk about what's sort of the final [[insight]], so to speak, one sees more and more that all things, including [[awareness]], [[consciousness]], or [[mind]], or whatever you want to call it, including things like space and like time, absolutely everything that we take for granted, is actually built and [[Fabrication|fabricated]] by my relationship to it, by the way I'm looking at it. Not to understand that, the [[Buddha]] called that the fundamental [[Avijja|delusion]], the fundamental [[ignorance]] that human beings have, or that [[Consciousness|consciousnesses]] have. So he's talking about something - I'm aware that as I'm saying it, it might sound, well, perplexing, but also kind of not that significant. The <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Buddha" href="Buddha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buddha</a></span> said this is actually _the_ most significant thing in the [[Dharma]][[What is Insight#Everything is fabricated|.]] ^12-1
###### 12-2
There was a seeker called [[Kaccayana|Kaccāyana]]. And he approached the [[Buddha]] one time, and he said, "What is this [[Avijja|delusion]]? And what's the right [[Ways of Looking|way of seeing]] things?" And the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Buddha" href="Buddha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buddha</a></span> said ordinary beings - in other words, unawakened beings - think dualistically. They conceive in terms of dualisms. They conceive that their self and the things around their self either exist or don't exist. They say "it is" or "it is not." They think dualistically in terms of "it is" and "it is not." So things and situations are really real, or really not real. Because of that, there's [[clinging]]. Because of that fundamental <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" href="Avijja" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delusion</a></span>, there's <span class="transcript"><a data-href="clinging" href="clinging" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clinging</a></span>, and then there's [[Dukkha|suffering]]. It's out of that that there's <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering</a></span>, and the whole realm of <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dis-ease</a></span>, <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" href="Dukkha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissatisfaction</a></span>, the whole realm of what's called [[Samsara|saṃsāra]]. But he said, for those with [[insight]] into _how -_ stressing that word _how -_ [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] arise, to _how_ they sustain, and to _how_ they cease (that is, this [[Dependent Origination|dependent arising]] I'm talking about), there is no "is," and there is no "is not." He said - a quote from the <span class="transcript"><a data-href="Buddha" href="Buddha" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buddha</a></span>: "That things exist, O <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kaccayana" data-href="Kaccayana" href="Kaccayana" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaccāyana</a></span>, is one extreme. That they do not exist is another. But I accept neither 'is' nor 'is not,' and I declare the truth from the middle position."^[SN 12:15] ^12-2
###### 12-3
So I'm not sure how that sounds. It probably sounds very different ways to different people. It's really, really, really not [[Nihilism|nihilistic]]. So it can be easy to hear that teaching and feel it's very destructive, very <span class="transcript"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nihilism" data-href="Nihilism" href="Nihilism" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nihilistic</a></span>. It's really not. The deeper we go into this - and it's a very gradual thing, it's a very gradual process - the deeper we go into it, the more [[freedom]] is liberated, the more [[Happiness|joy]], the more peace, the more [[love]] and [[compassion]] are liberated. And even that is actually a real possibility for us. It's totally a real possibility for us on this path. It's the promise of this path that it can deliver[[What is Insight#This far from being nihilistic quite the opposite|.]] ^12-3

Okay. That's it. [laughs] So going back to what I said at the beginning: big overview, did it in just an hour, okay? Big overview, right from very, very basic, right all the way - how is it to hear all that? Just wanted to paint a little bit of a roadmap, and just see how that is.
