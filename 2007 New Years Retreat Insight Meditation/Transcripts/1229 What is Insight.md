_This talk presents a map and overview of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Insight Meditation</a></span>, exploring the different kinds and levels of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> available to us, the possible avenues for its development and deepening, and some of the many ways we can <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nurture</a></span> and strengthen its unfolding._ ^1-1
###### 1-2
So the theme I would like to explore this evening is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. Just to go into what that means. What is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>? What does that mean when we talk about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, when we talk about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a></span>? Very much what I want to do in this talk is give an overview, very much of an overview, so big, big picture. I want to offer some of the avenues of possibility for how <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> deepens, and what that process is, can be - some of the possibilities. And to really give, what I want to do is to give a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span>. So it's very much about just kind of putting things in place<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > This talk is about putting things in place" data-href="What is Insight#This talk is about putting things in place" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2
###### 1-3
Right from the start, I'm aware that there are, you could say, different <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="personality types" class="internal-link">personality types</a></span>, in terms of how people learn. And so for some people, having an overview, having a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a></span> of how things fit together, and kind of what goes where, and how it all works together, they feel inside themselves that that's really necessary, and without that, they feel just totally disoriented on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>. Other people, other <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="personality types" class="internal-link">personality types</a></span> or learning types, whatever, are actually confused when you start talking about an overview. So it's a tricky situation. [laughs] But this talk is an overview talk. And so I hope you can bear with that, if it's not your style<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Different personality types react differently to conceptual frameworks" data-href="What is Insight#Different personality types react differently to conceptual frameworks" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3
###### 1-4
I also want to cover a lot of territory tonight, so got about an hour. [laughs] Just go right from kind of the beginnings of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>, the most basic sort of ideas of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>, right all the way to the end, to the final kind of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span>. And that, too, I'm also aware, again, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="personality types" class="internal-link">personality types</a></span> here, and just how people respond to that. But please, do use this talk to get your bearings, in a sense, and have a sense of where you're navigating. But I'm well aware that some of what I talk about towards the end of the talk will be, as I said, about the sort of deep end of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>, and as such, will be not yet in the realm of probably most people's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> in this room. It _is_ in the realm of some people's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>; I know that. And just, what does the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> do when it hears that kind of stuff? Do we feel inspired? Do we feel daunted? Does the measuring, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind" data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">comparing mind</a></span> come up? "Oh god, I'll never get there. I'm hopeless. I can't _da-da-da-da-da."_ And we compare where we feel we are to whatever we're hearing about. So just to, as I'm talking tonight, just to please be aware of how you're listening, what you're bringing to the listening<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Talking about the deep end of the path can feel daunting" data-href="What is Insight#Talking about the deep end of the path can feel daunting" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-4
###### 1-5
Okay. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a></span> - this word, '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>': very, very general kind of definition we could give is, what is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>? Any seeing or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> that brings the dissolution or the dissolving or a decrease in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dissatisfaction</a></span>, in <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dis-ease</a></span>, in what we call <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>. So any seeing or <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span> that brings just an ease, some easing or completely dissolving of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span> - that's what we call <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. Now, that can happen intellectually, but if it's just an intellectual <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>, and it doesn't lead to this easing, this lessening of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, it doesn't actually count or qualify as an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. So that applies - this "What is an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>?," that which brings the lessening of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> - it applies to any situation, and any <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> whatsoever. Any situation, any <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, you can apply <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> to, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> is relevant. And the range is extreme - on one level, we could say, from the most mundane sort of everyday <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span> that don't even feel like they have a lot to do with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> or whatever, to the most subtle, and the most profound and - whatever you want to say - transcendent<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > General definition of insight that which brings lessening of suffering" data-href="What is Insight#General definition of insight that which brings lessening of suffering" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-5
###### 2-1
So an example of something that we could call more mundane or whatever, but very, very important, would be, I notice, you notice, we notice that when I have a difficulty with someone else, in relationship, whether I know that person or not, when I talk to them and express the difficulty I'm having, and I talk in an accusing way - "You _da-da-da-da-da_," and I tell that person how they are, usually there's an increase in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. Doesn't usually help. Occasionally it might, but usually it doesn't help to talk to a person that way. So just pulling any old basic example out of the hat. The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> there is, "Okay, if I want to actually address this and bring about a calming of the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in the situation, well, I need to not talk accusingly. I need to just refrain from trying to tell a person how they are." Just very, very basic, very, very simple - turns out to be quite difficult for a lot of us. But still, it's there. [5:52] ^2-1
###### 2-2
One of my teachers had a way of kind of conceptualizing of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, and talked about a possible <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> at it. Three kinds of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span>: **(1)** the **personal**, **(2)** the **universal**, and **(3)** the **ultimate**. There are three kinds, and in a way, they're separate. In a way, they're not so separate<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > 3 kinds of insights" data-href="What is Insight#3 kinds of insights" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
**(1)** What does **<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">personal insight</a></span>** mean? What does it mean to have <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> on a personal level? This means knowing, inquiring into and knowing one's own <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">particular patterns</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">tendencies</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, of speech, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. And again, this could be anything. So I have a friend, and in the context of her relationship, actually, with her husband, she notices - and this, I think she said this has been going on quite a while - that when her husband expresses a need, just a simple need like, "Oh, I'd like a cup of tea as well," or whatever, sometimes she doesn't even hear it. [laughter] It's not actually as big a problem as that might sound. It's just a little kind of niggle in their relationship. So they're both practitioners, and quite - to see that, to know that, is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. There's this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">particular pattern</a></span>. There's this particular tendency. And then, just to know that. So okay, that's an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> into, in this case, a personal situation<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Personal insight into ones own habits of body speech and mind" data-href="What is Insight#Personal insight into one's own habits of body speech and mind" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
Or one might see, "In a situation of disagreement with another, my tendency is always to assume that I'm wrong and the other person is right, that I don't know. Or often to assume that." Or the other way around: "To assume I'm always right. I always know what's best. And they're always wrong. People don't see as clearly as I do." So all kinds of examples possible here. But the general thrust to really be alive in our inquiry into our personal <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">tendencies</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a></span>, our personal kind of make-up. Not with any judgment. It's not about judging. It's just about, going back to the beginning, what I said, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> is about what frees us from <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>, frees us from <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dissatisfaction</a></span>, what helps - basically, what helps<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Be really alive in your inquiry into your personal tendencies" data-href="What is Insight#Be really alive in your inquiry into your personal tendencies" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 2-5
So this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">personal insight</a></span> also includes: what are my particular weaknesses? What are my particular strengths? Now, this is an interesting one, because oftentimes, for many of us, we're more aware of our weaknesses than our strengths: "Oh, I can't do that. I haven't got that together." And then we hear teachings or whatever about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a></span>, and we think, "Well, I haven't got that, I haven't got that, I haven't got." And we're aware of the things that we don't have, our weaknesses. But are we also aware of our strengths? This is quite some, you could say, some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="psychological maturity" class="internal-link">psychological maturity</a></span>, to just know, "What do I need to work on? And what's actually pretty good with me?<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Be aware of both personal weaknesses and strenghts" data-href="What is Insight#Be aware of both personal weaknesses and strenghts" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^2-5
###### 3-1
So again, many examples here. A person could be - and I'm not saying they have to be one or the other here - but a person could have a lot of access to their emotional lives. They know what they're feeling. They're in touch with that. They're able to express that. They feel the fullness, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>, the richness of that. And I'm not saying it follows from that at all, but they could have a particular weakness of, say, while that's there with the emotional life, not being so clear in situations - being, maybe, _too_ led by their <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>. (I'm really not saying those two go together.) Or the other way around: a person can be very clear, very analytical, and actually not have so much access to the depth and the richness of the life of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>. Just to know: what's the weakness, what's the strength, what needs some work? What's a strength? Do we know, do we acknowledge and appreciate our strengths? Really, really important. [10:01] ^3-1
###### 3-2
So this, the realm of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">personal insight</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> into our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="personhood" class="internal-link">personhood</a></span>, our personality, so to speak, also includes the whole realm of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">our story</a></span> - so the story that we tell ourselves, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a></span> that we tell ourselves and others about ourselves, about our life, about <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">our journey</a></span>. So this is a very, very significant area. It can be - and I'm sure you know, just hearing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a></span>, or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">mythological stories</a></span>, how beautiful <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a></span> can be, how touching, how opening, how, actually, revealing of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> they can be. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">Stories</a></span> can be very, very beautiful. They can be helpful, absolutely they can be helpful. And they can be unhelpful. And so this inquiry, this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, this inquiry into our own story needs to ask this question: the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a></span> that I'm telling myself about myself, about my life - are they helpful, or are they unhelpful? Is it helpful, or is it unhelpful<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Are the personal stories we tell ourselves helpful or unhelpful" data-href="What is Insight#Are the personal stories we tell ourselves helpful or unhelpful" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
It may well be that telling myself <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">a certain story</a></span> of my upbringing, of my childhood, of my journey, that through the telling of that story, I actually embrace aspects of myself, I open to aspects of myself that I otherwise might shut out. And the story's helping to open that. It's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span>. It's reclaiming something. But it can also be, or it can be at a later time, that we get stuck in a story, stuck in telling ourselves a <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">narrative</a></span> or something about how we are, about where we've come from, etc. We get stuck and over-identified with that. This is a very difficult area, not easy to kind of navigate this and balance this and inquire into this. It's something that's actually, I think, important for all of us. I don't think anyone is exempt from this, this inquiry. Is the story helpful? And if so, how? And is it not helpful? And if so, how? And is it possible to actually tell myself a different story, to rewrite my story? And actually, yes, that is possible<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Its not easy to navigate and inquire into those stories" data-href="What is Insight#It's not easy to navigate and inquire into those stories" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3
###### 3-4
Any story we have of ourselves can never, even if it's very beautiful, even if it's very compelling, even if it seems completely obvious, it can never be the whole truth. There's no way. Truth as such is bigger than anything you can fit it into. A story, helpful as it might be, can never be the whole truth. And there comes a time, in a way - not that we get rid of a story, necessarily, but in a way, we know a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> from <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">our story</a></span>, as well as being able to pick it up<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > No story can ever be the whole truth" data-href="What is Insight#No story can ever be the whole truth" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-4
###### 3-5
Okay. As I said, I'm moving a lot of territory here, and you can just kind of sit back, and just hear about all this, really - the realm of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">personal insight</a></span>. ^3-5
###### 3-6
**(2)** The realm of **<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ultimate Truth" data-href="Ultimate Truth" class="internal-link">universal insights</a></span>**. What these are are, rather than things that are particularly true for me (my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">tendencies</a></span>, my patterns, etc.), these are universally true, true for all things and all beings. So the most obvious example would be <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>. It's just true for everyone and all things. It's a universal reality, we could say<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Universal insights pertain to all beings and all things" data-href="What is Insight#Universal insights pertain to all beings and all things" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-6
###### 4-1
This is interesting. I'm going to talk more about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ultimate Truth" data-href="Ultimate Truth" class="internal-link">universal truths</a></span>, but the realm of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">personal truths</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ultimate Truth" data-href="Ultimate Truth" class="internal-link">universal truths</a></span>, together, inquiring into that, deepening our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> into those whole realms of personal and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ultimate Truth" data-href="Ultimate Truth" class="internal-link">universal truths</a></span>, personal and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ultimate Truth" data-href="Ultimate Truth" class="internal-link">universal insights</a></span> - what that brings, what that can bring, what it should bring is that we are more and more, very gradually, very non-linearly, more and more able to be with, to open to, to respond skilfully, and to care for the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">world of our body</a></span>, to care, to respond for our <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, to know our <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Feelings" data-href="Feelings" class="internal-link">world of our feelings</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind" data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">world of our mind</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Relationships" data-href="Relationships" class="internal-link">world of our relationships</a></span>. What is it to respond well and to care in the realm of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span>? <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Body</a></span>, feeling, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="relationships" class="internal-link">relationships</a></span>, the realm of our work, etc. All that, personal and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ultimate Truth" data-href="Ultimate Truth" class="internal-link">universal truths</a></span>, part of that function is to help us be able to relate well, to be with well, to respond well to all that realm - what we could call the realm of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conventional reality" data-href="Conventional reality" class="internal-link">relative truth</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="conventional reality" class="internal-link">conventional reality</a></span>, this world that it seems very obvious that we live in. I'm going to come back to that. And this really, really, really is a function of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. Really, really, very much obviously a possibility of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Personal and universal truths help us to respond well to conventional reality" data-href="What is Insight#Personal and universal truths help us to respond well to conventional reality" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-1

Question, question: am I, are we, in our life, giving equal <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to so-called working with <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conventional reality" data-href="Conventional reality" class="internal-link">the relative</a></span> and so-called opening to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ultimate Truth" data-href="Ultimate Truth" class="internal-link">the ultimate</a></span>? Are they equal for us? Do we actually give equal <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span>, equal care of inquiry into that? I think this is very interesting. And you get - moving around in different <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="spiritual circles" class="internal-link">spiritual circles</a></span> over decades, one sees <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">tendencies</a></span> in different <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="spiritual circles" class="internal-link">spiritual circles</a></span>.

It's a good idea to take care of how we are with each other ethically, as Jake was talking very beautifully in the opening talk, to really care about that. It's a really, really good idea. This is an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, to really care what I put out into the world, the vibrations that I'm putting out there, what's reverberating in my wake.

But the potential there is, through the repeating of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, seeing it over and over, it descends to become unshakeable. Something like the importance of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">meditation practice</a></span>, for many people, that's unshakeable.

We can talk, in the process of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>, as we walk <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>, wherever we are on <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>, wherever we are, we can talk about <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span> arising.

And so, one very common approach to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> is just to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a></span> the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, just to be steady in one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to, one's presence to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Present moment" class="internal-link">Present moment</a></span>, and just trust that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>. And of course the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> goes, and we bring it back, and it goes, and we bring it back. Something can potentially happen through just devoting oneself to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, to presence, to being here fully. And in the climate of that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, even if it doesn't feel like great <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, perfect <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> - whatever that is - even if it doesn't feel like that, "Oh! Some <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>." Again, over the whole range, could be very, very simple, to do with anything, mundane, whatever.

So there's, we can say, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span> _arising_, and then another mode, which is what I would call _using_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span> or _consolidating_ <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span>.

I see the importance of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> of judgmentalism, whatever it is. We see that, and it feels really clear. Or we see <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, and it feels really clear: "I see it. Everything's changing." And we see it crystal clear: "Aha!" Sometimes, it's done there. It's finished, done, that's it, you can retire that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> and just live off its interest in the inner bank. Usually, though, it takes some acting on. You actually need to consolidate it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Insights arising vs using insights" data-href="What is Insight#Insights arising vs using insights" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-5

So we have this great clarity, whether it's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a></span> or whatever it is. I see the importance of being more kind to myself - whatever it is. And then, a little time goes by, and that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> fades. We lose touch with that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span>. We feel like we're back where we were. Very important: to consolidate, to deepen the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, actually needs, very often, us to _act_ on it. So even when the sense of it, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a></span> has changed, one asks oneself, "I don't feel it right now. But I remember having that <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. What if I acted now? What if I chose now in my life as if I knew that was true, because I know what I saw there was more true than all this, whatever seems real now?

Very often, we have an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, but it actually leaves us kind of sitting on a fence.

So there's this, as I said, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> arising, just arising out of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>. And there's also this acting on, using and consolidating. But there's another way that we can use and consolidate an <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. And that's, rather, using <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> as a kind of mode of seeing. Remember, what I'm doing tonight is I'm just creating <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Conceptual framework" data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">conceptual frameworks</a></span>. I'm hoping this is helpful. A mode of seeing. I'll explain what I mean by that. What would it be - say, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> - to, rather than just wait for a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> and the ricochets of that, the reverberations of that, what would it be to actually look at one's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, just being interested in <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>? Put that on as a lens, a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of seeing</a></span>, as a practice. So this is moving beyond what we might call simple <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> or simple presence or being, and actually deliberately taking up a certain mode of seeing, a certain <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a></span> at <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, for a period of time - a sitting, or half a sitting, or a day, or you know, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span>, or whatever it is, or a year<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Another way to consolidate the insight is to use it as a mode of seeing" data-href="What is Insight#Another way to consolidate the insight is to use it as a mode of seeing" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-2

I'll talk more about this, but we can talk then about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> as a kind of result, just sitting, being here, and just present, and just open, and there pops the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. Can talk about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> as a result. And we can talk about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> as - I can't really find the words - a process of using <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. I'll go into it a bit more. But both of these are important. And again, it's interesting, just in the realm of maybe <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personality types" data-href="Personality types" class="internal-link">personality differences</a></span>, etc., where we tend to go with that. So some people always want to just _be_, and just let things arise, and some people are always kind of probing and trying to look differently, or a tendency either way. Both are important, and I would say, maybe not just one way. Maybe not just one way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Insight as result vs insight as a process" data-href="What is Insight#Insight as result vs insight as a process" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-3

I'm looking at things through the lens of, say, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, or whatever." We can think, "Well, I'm not really, I haven't really got my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> together, can't really stay with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>. I'm not really together enough, got all these <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span> going on, not ready for that." Or, "I just want to be.

But actually, looking at things through certain <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">modes of seeing</a></span> as <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> actually calms the being.

What that means is, whenever there is any <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dissatisfaction</a></span> at all, any <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dis-ease</a></span>, any discomfort, any <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>, basically, any <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, any at all, can ask oneself a question: how am I contributing to this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>? How am I perhaps even sustaining it? At first that might sound like an odd question, because some sufferings that we're in, "This has nothing to do with me. I'm an innocent victim of this illness, of this situation, of this political situation, whatever it is." And it's not to ignore the importance of all that. But it's a safe assumption that, until we're completely awakened, whenever there is <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a></span>, whenever there's even the subtlest <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dis-ease</a></span>, discomfort, that the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unawakened mind</a></span> does something or some things to add to it unnecessarily.

Again, whole range of examples, but one is something like grumbling. So we're in a situation, we're annoyed with someone or something. Dharmically speaking, we have two options, really. One is, can I find a way of working with this that actually I let go? The situation remains, and I <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">just let go</a></span>. I've let go inside. Or, can I do something to address the situation? Can I bring a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a></span>, a skilfulness of communication, a care of communication to this person that I'm upset with? And can I solve the situation that way, or do something, make some changes in the world that are skilful and appropriate? So either I let go or I do something. Unfortunately, oftentimes, we find ourselves just, neither this nor that, and just sitting there grumbling to people who are sort of willing to hear. Grumbling is not helpful. It's actually leading to more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. It's a very obvious example, in a way, and a crass example, but it's important to see this. What am I doing that's actually compounding <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, adding a layer of unnecessary <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> there<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Example grumbling" data-href="What is Insight#Example grumbling" class="internal-link">?</a></span> ^7-3

Again, the story that I'm telling myself about the situation, about myself, whatever, is that increasing the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> in some way? Is that increasing the sense of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dissatisfaction</a></span>?

Now, sometimes, as I'm sure you'll recognize as I've just said that, sometimes we know we're doing this stuff. We actually know. We know that we're grumbling and it's not helping. It's not _that_ deep an <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. But somehow we just keep doing it. This is the interesting thing about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>. What is it that's going to make the change? There's no judgment in this question, because as I said, until one is completely awakened, you can pretty much safely assume that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> will be adding something to a situation that feels difficult, adding some unnecessary <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> to it - guaranteed. Some of it is going to be pretty gross and fairly easy to uncover. Others, it's extremely subtle - so to the most subtle kind of intentions and conceptions, delusions of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Be aware of subtle kind of delusions of awareness" data-href="What is Insight#Be aware of subtle kind of delusions of awareness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-5

Okay.

**(1) <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a></span>**, the first one, I don't know if you would agree, but I would say that to most human beings over the age of - what, I don't know, four, or five? I'm not sure - <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> is actually pretty obvious. It's a pretty obvious fact of our life. Remember, if we're interested in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span>, it's got to make a difference. It's got to make a difference to how we relate and how we live. So yes, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> is obvious. But are we seeing it in a way that makes a difference? Using this mode of seeing - actually just coming out of that very lovely mode of just being <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a></span>. I maybe skipped over that too quickly.

A real preciousness and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> in that way of being, way of practising, and trusting that out of that, the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a></span> will come.

But what would it be if we picked up <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, instead of waiting for the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> into <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> - "Aha!

What would it be to actually take up <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> as a lens, so that one's being <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a></span>, but all I'm interested in is noticing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>?

###### 8-3
<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a></span> - there are many ways of working with it, so oftentimes, what gets stressed is very, very microscopic noticing of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, moment to moment to moment, just seeing change, change, change, very, very fast. Or one can just go through one's day. And you can do that here, so there's an invitation: what would it be to get up tomorrow morning, and just say, "This day, I'm really going to focus in on change"? You take up - the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s words - you take up your theme. And one sees the change in the visual forms. Look: visual form, changing. It's just changing. All through the day, changing visual form, all through the day, changing emotional climate, all through the day. Do I go to bed in the same mood as I got up? Has it stayed the same all day? All through the day, changing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a></span>, changing sounds. Right now, the sounds are changing. Just going through and just focusing on <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> so that the fact of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> begins to impress itself deeply, deeply on the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>. And we begin more and more to be able to live that way. [38:38] ^8-3

If you try this - again, it's an invitation - at some point in your path, if you try this, you will see that contemplating that way should bring a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span>, should bring an ease, should bring a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>.

So you're actually using it in the moment as a way of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">feeling into freedom</a></span>, of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">opening up into freedom</a></span>.

So sometimes, and particularly with the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence contemplation</a></span>, you read in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="commentaries" class="internal-link">commentaries</a></span> - not actually originally what the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> said, but you read in the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="commentaries" class="internal-link">commentaries</a></span> that if one contemplates <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, one will start getting really freaked out, and really upset, and really agitated, and disgusted with life, and horrified, and very afraid, etc. I don't think that's how <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> works. I think, going back to right what I said at the beginning, the mark of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> is that it brings a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>. It brings of sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>.

[40:18] If they lead to a sense of agitation or confusion existentially, or all the rest of it, torment - wrong! Put it away! Do something else. So if we <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">contemplate impermanence</a></span>, to ask oneself: am I contemplating it in a way that's actually helpful, that's leading to <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>, to that sense? Okay, so there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>. There's the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">first characteristic</a></span>, the first mode of seeing<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Commentaries point towards a dark night of the soul but I dont think thats how insight works" data-href="What is Insight#Commentaries point towards a dark night of the soul but I don't think that's how insight works" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-6

All this can sound very depressing. Again, really, really want to stress: they lead to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>. If we pick them up, if we use them in the right way, they lead to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, peace, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span>, etc. If things are <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a></span>, if things are always changing, they cannot give us lasting satisfaction. And so one can, again, put on a mode of seeing for a sitting, a day, a month, a year. What if I saw everything as unsatisfactory?

So I'm really not going to go into this in a big way, but just to say, that's also a mode of seeing. And with practice, there's the possibility: instead of identifying with everything that comes up, identify with my <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a></span>, identify with my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>, "They're me," or "They're mine," identify with my thoughts, "They're me," or "They're mine," one learns to practise <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> of identification, regarding things as <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a></span>.

It's not at all about disconnection, or dissociation, or numbing out, or anything like that. It's practising a mode of seeing, a certain lens.

Earlier today, I feel like I'm also getting ill in some manner. And there was a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pain" data-href="Pain" class="internal-link">headache</a></span>, and I was sitting. And this goes back to this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">push and pull</a></span> thing. I just want to drop this in there as a little titbit. What happens - the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pain" data-href="Pain" class="internal-link">headache</a></span> comes up. Natural, or you could say, normal reaction of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span> is to want to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">push it away</a></span>. Want to get rid of this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pain" data-href="Pain" class="internal-link">headache</a></span>, quite intense, unpleasant. I've seen this before, but found that if I work with just relaxing the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a></span>, just opening, just allowing, relaxing the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> came. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a></span> came. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span> was actually blocking a sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>, of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, of warmth, of openness. So again, one could take that up, and use that as a way to practise <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a></span>. I just sit here, and I <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">just let go</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, and the heart - again, you can see this; you can experiment with this in your practice, over the years, really - lets go of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a></span>, and the warmth comes. The heart opens. More <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> comes. [50:00] So all these <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="three characteristics" class="internal-link">three characteristics</a></span>, we see, if we practise them as <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">modes of seeing</a></span>, they absolutely lead to a sense of less <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. The <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> just drains out. That's really, really important to see, to see the skilfulness of seeing that way, to develop the skill of seeing that way<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Just letting go of the aversion in the heart the heart opens" data-href="What is Insight#Just letting go of the aversion in the heart the heart opens" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-5

So let's backtrack a little bit. When we talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, we often talk about: is it possible to be with something, as I said, I think the first morning, just in a very bare way, just really meet the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> as it is, and not overlay it with a whole bunch ... [audio cut out for about twenty seconds] Just doing that, just being present, just being <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> of this <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">proliferation</a></span>, this tendency to sort of get over-entangled and blow things up. The more we can just meet things with a very, very simple, basic, beautiful <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, just there, what we find - and this is a very common <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, as many of you will know, and others will probably discover as the days go by - what we find is, our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> begins to brighten. So, literally, people say, "The grass seems more green. The sky seems more blue. I'm just hearing more clearly. I'm seeing more clearly." There's a kind of radiance that begins to come into one's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, the more that we're able to meet it in a very direct, very simple, bare way - <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Attention" data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">bare attention</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight >  the more we let go of papanca the more our experience begins to brighten" data-href="What is Insight# the more we let go of papanca the more our experience begins to brighten" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-2

And it can be that through that, we keep deepening that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, we're actually <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> of anything else, and there's just this sense of this moment, and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span>, the exquisite <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a></span> of this moment - just the now. And it can even seem to be sparkling. Like the sense of now, the sense of sparkling there. It's a very lovely aspect of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> that's available to us. It has a real intimacy with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, an intimacy with life. That's very much a fruit of this simple <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>, and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">proliferation</a></span>, of story and all that<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Letting go makes the now sparkle" data-href="What is Insight#Letting go makes the now sparkle" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-3

But it can be, then, that we feel like this moment and that radiance, immanence of things, is the reality, is the absolute truth of things, the only real thing. We hear this word <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness > Suchness" data-href="Emptiness#Suchness" class="internal-link">suchness</a></span>, and it's come to actually mean something which it didn't originally mean: "<span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness > Suchness" data-href="Emptiness#Suchness" class="internal-link">Suchness</a></span> is just the way it exactly is in this moment, without my layers of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Papanca" data-href="Papanca" class="internal-link">papañca</a></span> and preconception" - that's not actually what it quite means. So there's something very, very beautiful here, and just coming very simply, very directly, very nakedly with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span>.

The <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> once said to practitioners, "Be someone who tears down the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a></span>" - so the <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Skandhas" data-href="Skandhas" class="internal-link">aggregates</a></span> means the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a></span>, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a></span>, the feeling life, thoughts, etc. Be someone who tears that all down.

But if we do that, if we follow this way, this mode of seeing, eventually, all that, all that in the realm of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> begins to, in a way, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a></span>, more and more and more, to the degree that we're able to let go in these ways.

Let go a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, and the thing fades. For example, a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> in the knee, you can see it.

Not to understand that, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> called that the fundamental <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>, the fundamental <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="ignorance" class="internal-link">ignorance</a></span> that human beings have, or that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Consciousness" data-href="Consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousnesses</a></span> have. So he's talking about something - I'm aware that as I'm saying it, it might sound, well, perplexing, but also kind of not that significant. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> said this is actually _the_ most significant thing in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Everything is fabricated" data-href="What is Insight#Everything is fabricated" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-1

There was a seeker called <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kaccayana" data-href="Kaccayana" class="internal-link">Kaccāyana</a></span>. And he approached the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> one time, and he said, "What is this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>? And what's the right <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of seeing</a></span> things?" And the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> said ordinary beings - in other words, unawakened beings - think dualistically. They conceive in terms of dualisms. They conceive that their self and the things around their self either exist or don't exist. They say "it is" or "it is not." They think dualistically in terms of "it is" and "it is not." So things and situations are really real, or really not real. Because of that, there's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>. Because of that fundamental <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a></span>, there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a></span>, and then there's <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. It's out of that that there's <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>, and the whole realm of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dis-ease</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dissatisfaction</a></span>, the whole realm of what's called <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samsara" data-href="Samsara" class="internal-link">saṃsāra</a></span>. But he said, for those with <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> into _how -_ stressing that word _how -_ <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a></span> arise, to _how_ they sustain, and to _how_ they cease (that is, this <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a></span> I'm talking about), there is no "is," and there is no "is not." He said - a quote from the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>: "That things exist, O <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kaccayana" data-href="Kaccayana" class="internal-link">Kaccāyana</a></span>, is one extreme. That they do not exist is another. But I accept neither 'is' nor 'is not,' and I declare the truth from the middle position."^[SN 12:15] ^12-2

So I'm not sure how that sounds. It probably sounds very different ways to different people. It's really, really, really not <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nihilism" data-href="Nihilism" class="internal-link">nihilistic</a></span>. So it can be easy to hear that teaching and feel it's very destructive, very <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nihilism" data-href="Nihilism" class="internal-link">nihilistic</a></span>. It's really not. The deeper we go into this - and it's a very gradual thing, it's a very gradual process - the deeper we go into it, the more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span> is liberated, the more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a></span>, the more peace, the more <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> are liberated. And even that is actually a real possibility for us. It's totally a real possibility for us on this path. It's the promise of this path that it can deliver<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > This far from being nihilistic quite the opposite" data-href="What is Insight#This far from being nihilistic quite the opposite" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-3

Okay. That's it. [laughs] So going back to what I said at the beginning: big overview, did it in just an hour, okay? Big overview, right from very, very basic, right all the way - how is it to hear all that? Just wanted to paint a little bit of a roadmap, and just see how that is. This is the map, some possibilities of the map. Can I just ...? Maybe it's helpful. Maybe not. Maybe it gets bearings, and maybe not<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > This is the map some possibilities of the map" data-href="What is Insight#This is the map some possibilities of the map" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^12-4
