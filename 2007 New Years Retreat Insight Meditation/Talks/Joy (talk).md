## Paragraphs
[[Joy (talk) -|plain list]]

<span class="paragraph">_The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> placed great emphasis on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> (<a data-href="mudita" class="internal-link">mudita</a>) and <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (sukkha) as part of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>. This talk explores the place of these beautiful and precious qualities in our practice, and life. What are the foundations of <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>? What is it that allows the heart to open to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>?_</span>

##### What about joy?
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1231 Joy (talk) > ^1-2" data-href="1231 Joy (talk)#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (4) · <a data-href="Wonder" class="internal-link">Wonder</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11971/20071231-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-joy-11971.mp3#t=00:00" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And so what about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>? What about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>? We may <a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a> that, and it's relatively common in interviews or group interviews or for someone to say, "What about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>? You're going on and on about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, and I'm actually experiencing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, and I'm not even sure if it's okay." [laughter] And to someone who might just peer in here from time to time - like some of our neighbours kind of look in on us from afar, from a safe distance - and look at people shuffling back and forth, staring at the floor, wrapped in blankets, and it looks pretty grim. [laughter]</span>

##### According to the Buddha, it's a path of joy
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1231 Joy (talk) > ^1-3" data-href="1231 Joy (talk)#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> (2) · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11971/20071231-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-joy-11971.mp3#t=00:55" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> also referred to it as a path of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>. So he quite commonly contradicted himself, and was quite happy doing that. It was a path of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>. And his followers, you know, the monks and nuns and the lay practitioners, they were - how could you tell a follower of the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>? Radiance, joyfulness. It was a mark of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>.</span>

##### Sometimes in the West, joy does not receive the same attention as other brahmaviharas
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1231 Joy (talk) > ^1-4" data-href="1231 Joy (talk)#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> (5) · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> (2) · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> (3) · <a data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">Brahmaviharas</a> (2) · <a data-href="Compassion" class="internal-link">Compassion</a> (2) · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11971/20071231-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-joy-11971.mp3#t=01:25" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">And it's interesting: well, if we just think about <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> in the West, last (what is it?) thirty-something years, thirty and a few, thirty-something years, a lot of emphasis on the <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a>, on the being with, and then a little while later, sort of, "Okay maybe we need to add some <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>." And a big, big emphasis on kind of lubricating the practice with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a> and really the necessity of that, of the <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to the climate of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>. Of course we talk about <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Mettā</a> [and] <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> are two of the four what's called <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">brahmavihāras</a>, '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Brahmaviharas" data-href="Brahmaviharas" class="internal-link">divine abidings</a>.' And <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> is another one. So there's a lot of talk about these: <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. And sometimes <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> doesn't receive the same emphasis, the same care of <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a>, really.</span>

##### Worldly and spiritual joy
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1231 Joy (talk) > ^1-5" data-href="1231 Joy (talk)#^1-5" class="internal-link">1-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (9) · <a data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">Mudita</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11971/20071231-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-joy-11971.mp3#t=02:26" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> _did_ actually talk a lot about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, and there are different kinds of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, different kinds of <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>. He talked about worldly and non-worldly <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>, or worldly and non-worldly <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, which sounds a bit strange. But worldly and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">spiritual joy</a>. And so not at all to deny the range and the kinds of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> that are available to us as human beings, but when we talk about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">spiritual joy</a> or <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>, not based on the ego, not based on what I am getting, not based on being better than someone, on measuring up in a certain way. Also not based on sense gratification; that's a little bit more subtle, and I'll come back to that later. Not based on sense gratification.</span>

##### Different ways spiritual joy expresses itself
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1231 Joy (talk) > ^1-6" data-href="1231 Joy (talk)#^1-6" class="internal-link">1-6</a>**: _<a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (9) · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> · <a data-href="Appreciation" class="internal-link">Appreciation</a> (2) · <a data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">Beauty</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> (2) · <a data-href="Sangha" class="internal-link">Sangha</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> · <a data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">Mudita</a> (6)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11971/20071231-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-joy-11971.mp3#t=03:35" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">==So it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> that comes from <a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a> of the beautiful qualities of heart; <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> that comes from <a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a>, cultivating <a data-href="appreciation" class="internal-link">appreciation</a>; <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> that comes from opening, from connecting, from perceiving <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a>, from developing our capacity to perceive <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a>, from the deepening of our practice, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> in practice itself, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> in the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> in the teachings, in hearing the teachings, in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Sangha" data-href="Sangha" class="internal-link">Saṅgha</a>, in the community of people who <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> to practise, who are interested in practising. This is all <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, spiritual joy.== And very traditionally, this third brahmavihāra, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">muditā</a>, often gets translated as <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">sympathetic joy</a>, which means <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> of others. So instead of envy or feeling, "Why have they got this, and why haven't I got that?", it's delighting in the delight of others. That's how <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">muditā</a> is usually translated, but I feel it's a little bit too narrow of a translation. So really this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">muditā</a>, this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">spiritual joy</a> encompasses everything of what I've just said.</span>

##### The being is deeply nourished through joy
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1231 Joy (talk) > ^2-1" data-href="1231 Joy (talk)#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (3) · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Maybe <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> has a very significant and important place in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>. Maybe it really is something that we need to give <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to. There's deep <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a>. The being is deeply nourished through <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>. Very, very powerful and profound, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a> that comes from <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>.</span>

##### Joy is helpful in the practice of reconditioning of the mind and heart
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1231 Joy (talk) > ^2-2" data-href="1231 Joy (talk)#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Reconditioning" class="internal-link">Reconditioning</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2) · <a data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">Habit</a> (3) · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (6) · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11971/20071231-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-joy-11971.mp3#t=06:04" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">One of the things we're doing in practice, as well, is we're <a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a> the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> and the heart. So it may not sound that glamorous, but our minds, in a way, are run in loops. They run round and round in loops and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a>. A lot of those are not very joyful. You just have to sit a day in silence and witness some of those, see those loops, see those <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a>. They're not joyful or bringing of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>. And a big part of what we're doing in practice is we're <a data-href="reconditioning" class="internal-link">reconditioning</a> those loops. Just replacing these tired, old loops that are not helpful, replacing them with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>. When we give <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, it becomes so that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> moves towards becoming a <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a>. The <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> finds a groove in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, instead of a groove in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a>, in negativity, in difficulty.</span>

##### Joy is also purifying
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1231 Joy (talk) > ^2-3" data-href="1231 Joy (talk)#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Joy</a>, <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>, is also purifying. So this is quite an interesting one. May not at first be obvious. When we perhaps reflect or think, what does this mean, we hear about a 'path of purification,' 'this is a path of purification,' we tend to think, "What is purification going to look like and feel like? It's going to look like and feel like a lot of pretty nasty stuff coming up and out, and I kind of have to just sit through that and bear with it. And the more miserable it is, the better I'm scrubbing out the system." You know, _maybe_ there's some truth to that, but I don't know.</span>

##### The more joy we have just coming and going, the more we feel we have enough
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1231 Joy (talk) > ^2-4" data-href="1231 Joy (talk)#^2-4" class="internal-link">2-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (4) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">Now, we can assume, and this is, I think, quite common, that perhaps <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> is a bit superficial compared with the real heavy, dark stuff that we need to deal with. I come across that quite a lot, and certainly reflecting on my own past, really feel that I was very much in that view for quite some years. I really had to get in there, and if I was working deeply, that was when I was in contact with what was difficult. If I was in contact with what was difficult, that was a sign that, "Oh, this is really deep work. The real work is through going through the hard stuff, which is unhappy." So just to ask, all of us to ask ourselves: where is my assumption on that? What is my assumption on that? What do I assume about the <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a> of depth and <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>, or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a>?

<span class="paragraph">So all human beings are interested in <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>, and we assume that we're interested in <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>. But I also feel that it's actually quite rare for someone to be, I don't know what the word is, _ruthlessly_ interested in <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>. [laughs] You know, it's a cliché to say, we look in the wrong places for <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>. And we _do,_ and we all know that, but it's become meaningless. And we're bombarded with advertisements saying, either deliberately telling us or very unsubtly or subtly implying that you need this or you need that, or you need to do this or that, or look like this or that to be happy. That's the kind of message. We're bombarded with that. And so in <a data-href="spiritual circles" class="internal-link">spiritual circles</a>, or even self-help circles, whatever it is, it's a cliché to say we're looking in the wrong place. But it's actually quite rare, I think, for someone to really kind of take this bull by the horns and say, "Let me get to the bottom of this question of <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>. Let me not let go of it. Let me go right, keep hanging on, and not settle for anything kind of second best." And it may be, I think it _is_ actually, it may be, that a full inquiry into <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>, into <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, turns out to be the same thing as an inquiry into <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Freedom" data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">freedom from suffering</a> - that to follow one question to its end is to follow the other question to its end. So it's like two sides of the same coin in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>.</span>

But I just want to drop something in about another word, very briefly: fulfilment. There was a survey of parents. I can't remember where or when, but it tested in some way their <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> before being parents and after being parents. And pretty common, pretty strong result, that they were less happy once they were parents. [laughter] But fortunately there was a little sophistication on the part of the psychologists. They had another question, rating their sense of fulfilment, and that was often much higher.</span>

<span class="paragraph">What I'm trying to say is, it's a complex picture here, and not to grab too much on one thing. If I think about teaching sometimes, you know, the truth is oftentimes it's very challenging. It's very hard. There's a lot about it that's difficult and tiring and all the rest of it. And yet, I would say, I would never - I mean, sometimes it's totally joyful, and it's a real <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> to share the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>; mostly it is. But I can, without hesitation, always say that it's deeply fulfilling. It's something profoundly fulfilling, with all the difficulties. Before I was a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Dharma teacher</a>, I was a musician, and in the later years a composer. The artistic process, if one really cares about creating something, really cares about what it is one's expressing, a lot of frustration in that process, a lot of the nitty-gritty and the sort of really trying to get it right. Is that a joyful process? I don't know. Is it fulfilling? Yes. So just to paint a bit of a bigger picture.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And when we talk about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, there's such a huge range, and all the way from someone literally feeling like they're going to burst in ecstasy - that _does_ happen, and there are people in this hall I know who have come to me and said something like that more than once.

A lot of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> is not that remarkable. I really want to include that tonight.

<span class="paragraph"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Joy</a> can relativize a lot. The presence of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> can relativize a lot of other things in our life. We talk a lot about <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a>, and say, "Let go, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">just let go</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">just let go</a>."

Of course they're going to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a>. When we have, when we feel nourished, when we feel we have enough, it's much easier to let go. There's a story the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> once - you know, because they lived on alms, just receiving whatever they received for food that day. The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> went on alms round one day in a village, and he was next to another monk from a different tradition, and that monk got fed and the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> didn't get fed. And this other monk kind of turned to the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> and said, "Huh, now what are you going to do?", something like that. [laughter] "Big <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>!" [laughter] And the story goes there was just a pile of straw there, and the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> jumped onto the straw, crossed his legs, and sank into <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a>. Just before he sank, he said, =="Feeders on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> are we."== [laughter] And he was fine!</span>

<span class="paragraph">So I just want to say, I'm aware listening to this that it can actually be difficult to hear.

And especially when we hear about that range and we feel like, "Gosh, no idea about ..." For some people, that _does_ come, and for others it feels like totally alien to their range of <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>. So it can be difficult to hear, and I really appreciate that. It can bring up for us an <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> of the absence of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> in our life. Again, like I said the other night, can there be just a backing off of the measuring, and just a listening to what's possible?

##### The absence of aversion, the absence of pushing away and wanting to get rid of, brings joy

<span class="paragraph">If one could do that, and one had a connection, one was connected to that with presence, one was interested, sustained an interest, and one was accepting, completely allowing of that sadness, of that unpleasantness, and one was steady with those three things: ==connection, interest, acceptance== - C-I-A, if the CIA is there. [laughs] Maybe it's a stupid thing to say, but I would almost bet, I would almost wager that just slowly, gradually, if one can sustain that kind of relationship, it would turn into <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>. Probably just a very, very quiet <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>. It's through the relationship. It's through, it's dependent on our relationship that sadness arises and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a> arises. It's dependent on our relationship that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> arises. So this really is an invitation to experiment with this. Even as I'm talking, if you feel like, "Oof, I don't know," try this. The absence of <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>, the absence of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">wanting to get rid of</a>, brings <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Oftentimes when we hear the teachings, and when we might be hearing about this, it's quite common to have the attitude of, "Yeah, but it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a>. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Joy</a>'s <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a>." But I don't think that's enough. I'm not sure if that's enough. So of course it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a>, but I'm not sure that just kind of being afraid to develop it because, "Well, I don't want to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a> to it because, you know, it'll all end in tears" - I'm not sure that's enough.</span>

<span class="paragraph">There's a poem by <a data-href="William Blake" class="internal-link">William Blake</a>. I think it's sort of like this: =="He who tries to hold to a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> does the winged life destroy. But he who kisses a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> as it flies lives to see eternity's sunrise."== And so often what we hear in teachings - and it's a very important part of the teachings - is actually just let it all come and let it all go. ==<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Unhappiness</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, whatever it is, just don't <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a>.

<span class="paragraph">So yes, it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanent</a>, but we can also <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>.

We're just into the <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a> of it, and that's totally fine. And other times, we're very interested in cultivating the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, and we're deliberately in a mode of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a> something, nurturing something.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">It is impossible for anyone, even a <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>, to have <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> all the time.

[laughter] It's impossible to actually sustain. It's a condition and it doesn't sustain all the time. But it can be more frequent, and it can deepen, and we can learn to sustain it. This is a little bit of a different approach to the teachings. We can actually learn to sustain <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>. We can practise <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>. We can learn that. And we need to understand kind of how to do that.

##### Joy is a skill which can be gradually developed

<span class="paragraph">The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> used this word a lot, 'skill.' He used the word 'skill' a lot, which is not, for some people it's not a very attractive word, but there's something extremely just compassionate and pragmatic about it. If we said 'the art of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>,' it's a bit like, "Well, I'm not really an artist. I don't really have that." But a skill is something that we can all learn. Wherever we feel we are, we can develop more of a skill at something. And something which even might seem impossible can become just, through the gradual development of a skill, more and more possible for us.</span>

<span class="paragraph">I remember when I must have been about six or seven or something, and every year we had my cousins in Italy, and we used to drive, the whole family in the car, three days, which was interesting, across Europe to Italy, through France and Switzerland. And somewhere, I don't remember where it was, we stopped once, and there was a sort of go-kart track, ostensibly for kids, but it had traffic lights, and sort of complex road junctions, and the cars had gears and all this stuff. And I was however old, 6 or 7. My younger brother just looked right at it and leapt into the thing, full-on accelerator, and zoomed off, happy as Lewis Hamilton or whatever. And I was completely just overwhelmed, and just completely, I just froze. It seemed so complicated, and so, like, how do I even navigate this? And of course now driving is just, well, you don't even think about it. You just drive and have a complicated conversation with somebody. Just over time, it's a skill that develops. And I even remember when I was learning to drive, I was 16 or 17, also feeling overwhelmed. It's just a skill. It's just a skill, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, in a way, is the same.</span>

<span class="paragraph">One of my teachers, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Thanissaro Bhikkhu" data-href="Thanissaro Bhikkhu" class="internal-link">Ajaan Geoff</a>, talks about skilful attachment, and it's actually maybe worth, in a way, getting attached to what brings <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>. We talk about non-attachment and <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a>; maybe grabbing hold of what brings <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>. And later, we can let go of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> too. But it will only be because we're <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a> for something better. So he uses an analogy of a ladder, climbing a ladder. ==You don't let go of one rung until you've grabbed hold of the other one. There's something that's helping our <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a>, that's moving us on.== That may not be an <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a> that resonates very comfortably with a lot of people, because the notion of a ladder and holding on, it seems goal-oriented. We could get really into that; I won't tonight. What are the views about that? Is there a place for that view in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>, _as well_ as this other approach? They don't have to be mutually exclusive. There's also room for another approach of "Let it all come, let it all go.

<span class="paragraph">So what feeds it; what also eats away at <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>? Some of it's really obvious: worry. Worry is something we really have to learn in practice - it's a gradual learning - we learn how to work with worry, in a way, draining it of its <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>. There are some things in life, you know, there's such a cultural agreement about worrying about certain things, like money, for instance. Everyone - and it's understandable; I don't want to dismiss it or play it down, but it's almost like everyone is agreeing that we need to worry about money and investments, and have you got the right interest rate and portfolio and all this stuff. And it can be that one needs to actually be really firm with oneself about worry, and particularly things like money worry. Just, "I'm actually not going to do that. I'm really going to just cut it off. I'm going to practise <a data-href="generosity" class="internal-link">generosity</a>, something that's going against that grain," because it has such an inner momentum and such a cultural momentum, and once we're swept up in that, it will eat away the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>. I'm not saying that's easy, but sometimes it's like a kind of firmness with ourself is really important.</span>

Envy, greed, or the opposite of this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">sympathetic joy</a> - sort of someone else achieves something or does something really well, and we say, "Yeah, good," but we're sort of a little bit putting them down.

And can we just notice they're happening, and then just put the other movement in? Celebrate, take delight in the achievements of others and the success of others.</span>

##### Story: composer for an orchestral piece

<span class="paragraph">So, judging. Ten years, it must have been at least ten years ago when I was a composer. I had this piece performed in America. I was present at all the rehearsal processes with the orchestra, and such a sort of intense process of making sure everything was right, and every little note was exactly balanced with - you know, the oboe was balanced with the flute, and not too loud, and you got the exact rhythm right, and all this. And really, really intense, precise <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to detail, wanting it to be just right and just exactly what I had in <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">The concert came, and sitting, listening to the concert with the same attitude of, you know, "Oh, okay, that was wrong, and that wasn't quite balanced."

<span class="paragraph">Then a few days later, I went to visit some other friends who were musicians in New York.

It was like hours and hours. I think it was all day. And we went, and it was in a huge library. Different sort of acts would come on, and Arabic <a data-href="poetry" class="internal-link">poetry</a>. Of course we didn't understand Arabic at all, whatever. But the scene was families and kids and picnics and grandmas, and lots of noise, and just a whole big scene together. ==And I remember sitting there and sort of taking in the whole <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a> of the life unfolding. And of course what was very much absent was this critical, "Right. Wrong.

<span class="paragraph">One huge part in nurturing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> is not overlooking it.

We really need to recognize <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> and recognize what there is to appreciate.

So right here in the <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, and I think I spoke about this briefly in the opening talk, can we take care of our heart and our <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> by actually deliberately inclining the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> towards seeing the <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a> here? There's a lot of <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a> here. Seeing what there is to appreciate here, seeing the goodness here. How much goodness is here? Just at <a data-href="Gaia House" class="internal-link">Gaia House</a>, how much <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>?

It may not _look_ like that, but there's a lot of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a> behind what goes on here, through what goes on here. Can we incline the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a> to see that, deliberately?

##### Oftentimes, the mind inclines to the other way: fault-finding

<span class="paragraph">So sometimes to look around you when you're in the dining room, when you're just going about in the house, and just see: who else is here? Who's practising here? How lovely that we're here together practising, that we're supporting each other. If they weren't here, how much more difficult it would be to practise. Incline the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>. Oftentimes, too often, the <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a> of the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is the other way: fault-finding, what's irritating, what's wrong, what's the problem, what's difficult. Just, you need to incline the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>. It's going against our <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a>. It's going against our <a data-href="habit" class="internal-link">habit</a>, and we need to just, as I said, make new <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a>.

<span class="paragraph">The other day, I was just playing around with this. I was coming from somewhere, and I can't remember what it was, but I was a little bit irritated at something. I was driving, and I just said, "Okay, let me play with this." And driving along the road, and going one way, and of course the cars on the other side going the other way. I just reflected: how lovely that the other cars don't deliberately swerve into my car. [laughter] And I was, in a way, I was just being silly with it, but it actually really worked! It was quite interesting. I was really appreciating the fact that I can walk out there, I can drive out there, and of course bad things happen, and of course there are nasty people out there, of course. But actually, pretty much, on the whole, people are not that bad! [laughter] You can play with this stuff. There's a real element of play and experimentation, activity in practice, like shaking things up, and you can have fun with it.</span>

[gestures a huge size] But actually it's all full of positive news, lovely things that people are doing, whereas you flick through another newspaper, you put the news at ten on, and it's kind of, "Pheugh!", you know?

<span class="paragraph">A friend, actually he died recently, but a friend I had was a psychotherapist, and he worked with many different kinds of clients. One group he worked with was addicts of different kinds, people with different kinds of addictions. And one of the ways he would work with addicts in particular, one of the pieces that he would do with them, was he would ask them to make an inventory of things they were grateful for. They would come every week, and he would say, "Here's a piece of paper. Come back and write [I've forgotten what it was] ten things or something that you're grateful for." Almost without exception the reaction was, "_Pff_! I'm not doing that. That's stupid!" And yet, often they _would_ do it, and would report, "Wow, what a difference that made!" And it's just this inclining the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> towards what we have to be grateful for. ==Huge is the power of gratitude.== And not just for addicts, obviously. [audio cuts out briefly at 46:21] And a lot of it is about having a buddy and touching base with them, I think every day even, and just saying to them one thing that you're grateful for that day, one thing that touched your heart, one thing that was appreciative. And what a difference it makes!</span>

<span class="paragraph">One thing that becomes really significant in this is <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> itself. ==The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> said, a very significant quote, "Whatever one frequently dwells upon, that will become the inclination of the heart, the inclination of the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>."== To really reflect on the implications of that. If we dwell on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, pay <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, it becomes the inclination of the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>. So when there is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> (and the whole spectrum of what I'm talking about; please remember that - very undramatic, unremarkable-seeming, to the whole range of you're peeling yourself off the ceiling), how does it feel in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>? It's really, really significant. How does it feel in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>? ==So <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> actually does have a vibration in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, has a resonance there, reverberation. And if we can tune into that and just hold that in our attentiveness== (remember, even if it's nothing particularly strong), just have a look, see what's there in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>. How does the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> feel? But particularly, how does the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a> feel? And just tune into that vibration. It's a way that builds <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>. And through that, we become more and more familiar with that, more and more familiar with <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>. It becomes more and more accessible to us. And it deepens. It goes on a journey of deepening.</span>

##### Experiment how joy can feel like

<span class="paragraph">It's interesting, when there's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> there, to whatever degree, what feeds it and what doesn't. And I know for myself and many retreatants have come to me and reported, "There's so much <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> I feel like dancing." And oftentimes people _do._ Sometimes very early in the morning, no one else is up, and yogis are dancing down the corridor. If you get up early, you open your door, and you think you're on the set of _Strictly Come Dancing_ or whatever. [laughter] I'm exaggerating! But a person may really feel like, one tunes into it in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, and it actually feels like it wants to express. Or one's in the fields, and one just feels like wheeling and turning in the fields, and it's there and it wants to come out. Again, experiment with this if it's there and it feels strong. Move. See what that's like. What does that do to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>? And then there's also the experiment with just really being still with it and letting it kind of grow, letting it build inside. ==So all this, there's a lot of experimentation with all of it. But the <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to how it feels is really important.==</span>

##### Piti is the physical aspect of spiritual joy, not based on sense pleasure
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1231 Joy (talk) > ^10-3" data-href="1231 Joy (talk)#^10-3" class="internal-link">10-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">Mudita</a> · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> · <a data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">Piti</a> · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> (4) · <a data-href="Wonder" class="internal-link">Wonder</a> (3) · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a>_</span>

<span class="paragraph">(checks time) Yikes. Okay. So this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">spiritual joy</a>, what the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> called, and sometimes this physical aspect of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> is called _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Piti" data-href="Piti" class="internal-link">pīti</a>,_ and it can come also out of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a>. It's a pleasure that's not based on the senses. It's not based on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasure</a>. This is quite a significant point. It's not that we're interested in _closing_ the senses, but there is I think in practice, as it matures, a maturing of the relationship with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasure</a>. ==And so, rather than being hungry for it and sort of reliant on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasure</a>, we can be open to the pleasure through the senses, but it's actually a sense of <a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a> or mystery through the senses that we're tuning into more and more, rather than the aspect of it being pleasant or unpleasant==, lovely taste or lovely this or that. There's something that's available through the senses different than pleasure, different than <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasure</a>, that's actually deeper and more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a>, that has to do with <a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a>. We see something, the rain - maybe rain's not that pleasant; ==there's a <a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a> in it. Not dependent on pleasant or unpleasant; dependent on something else.==</span>

##### We can develop piti by attending to it
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1231 Joy (talk) > ^10-4" data-href="1231 Joy (talk)#^10-4" class="internal-link">10-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">Happiness</a> (4) · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> · <a data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">Samadhi</a> · <a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2)_</span>

<span class="paragraph">We can develop this physical feeling of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> - and again, this is talking about long-term practice now - by giving <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to it. It can seem like it comes out of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">concentration</a> sometimes, and it does. That's true. But it also comes out of, or what it _really_ comes out of, is non-entanglement. When we're not entangled with what's going on, when there's openness, that allows <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, allows <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>. And it can be, it can come to the point where one really feels one has a choice with this. So something difficult goes on - I remember about a month after 9/11, and living in America, and the US Army invaded Afghanistan, and I felt really sad, saddened by that. But I had just been <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a> a while ago, and there was a lot of access to this <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>. ==It was just interesting to notice that I could actually just decide to be sad or happy. Don't have to be a victim; there's some choice. Not _always_ one would have this choice. Training the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> and the power of training the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>. This _is_ available.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">I'm not sure about time, but are we still okay-ish? Yeah? I talked the other night about the <a data-href="three characteristics" class="internal-link">three characteristics</a> - contemplating <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a>, contemplating <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">unsatisfactoriness</a>, and contemplating things being <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Anatta" data-href="Anatta" class="internal-link">not-self</a>. And the more we contemplate that, the more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> it brings. We can see this. So they're not depressing. There's a <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a>. If we really inquire into <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, we realize that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> and <a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a> - <a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a> being an aspect of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, one of the faces of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> - it's kind of inversely, so to speak, related to how much <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">selfing</a> there is going on. The more self-concern, the more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a>, the less the capacity for <a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a>. So to really see this, that there's something in <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a> of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-view</a>, releasing that, <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a> of the identification that allows <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, allows <a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a> in particular.</span>

<span class="paragraph">There's that story of the frog that lives in the ocean, and he visits a frog that lives in a puddle. The frog in the puddle wants to say, you know, "Look at my puddle! It's pretty neat, isn't it?" And the ocean frog says, "Yeah ..." [laughter] And the puddle frog says, "Where do you live?" And he says, "Well, _pff_, you'd have to kind of come and check it out. I can't really explain."^[Coleman Barks, a translator of Rumi's works, first heard the story of the ocean frog from a teacher named Bawa Mahaiyaddeen, and further traces the story's origin not to Rumi but to a Taoist text by Chuang Tzu. See Coleman Barks, tr., _Rumi: Soul Fury: Rumi and Shams Tabriz on Friendship_ (New York: HarperOne, 2014), 7-8.] And it's a little bit like that. It's something that we mature into in a very natural and organic way as <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a> deepens.</span>

##### Often it's not the fact that I don't have the thing, but I believe I need it

<span class="paragraph">So <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a> of things and our dependency on things can sound bleak, but I really don't think it is. How much <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">unhappiness</a> is there in the world because one _believes_ I need something to be happy? It's not the fact that I don't have it; it's the fact that I _believe_ that I need it. In itself, it may not have anything to do with it. Very often, for example, money or relationship - there's so much hype about <a data-href="romantic love" class="internal-link">romantic love</a> <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">in our culture</a>, and so a person who doesn't have that very often feels, "I need that."

The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> of <a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a>, the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> of <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>. One of my teachers, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Thanissaro Bhikkhu" data-href="Thanissaro Bhikkhu" class="internal-link">Ajaan Geoff</a>, he was very fond of saying, "The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> was someone who did not let go. He did not let go in his search for the highest <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>." He actually clung to that, where most of the rest of us would let go at some point, and say "Oh, okay, I'll settle for this." He actually did not let go in his search for a deathless <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>. And also, as my same teacher, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Thanissaro Bhikkhu" data-href="Thanissaro Bhikkhu" class="internal-link">Ajaan Geoff</a>, says, "All the <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> that we <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> in life - we're going to die. How good can it be if it all ends in <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a>?" Is it possible to find a <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> beyond the things of life, a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> beyond the things of life? And sometimes the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> just boggles with that: "Or what, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Death" data-href="Death" class="internal-link">after death</a>, or what? What does it mean?" But how good can it be? However good it gets, it's going to end. It's going to be wiped out by <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a>. What would it be to take the inquiry into <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> _that_ deeply?</span>

##### Know and inquire into the whole range of joy

<span class="paragraph">So in a way, how tenacious, how ruthless, with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>, of course with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>, how honest, how thorough might we be in questioning the kinds of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> and the kinds of <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> there are? Because as I said, there's a huge range of it. There is, of course, <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasure</a>. There's <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> in being somebody important in the eyes of others, in praise. There's <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> in winning something, in competing. Just knowing the whole range. ==Really letting ourselves experiment and taste the whole range. Keeping that inquiry alive==, so that we know, and it's not what a teacher says, or the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> says, or an advertisement says, or this says or that says; we know in ourselves, in our hearts, about the kinds of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a> and what feels the best. It's not coming from 'should.' We know it in the heart. We know it in the life. We know it in the cells.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And what I really want to say is that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, like all aspects of the <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>, is an inquiry, and not to feel like it's impossible. It's a skill and an inquiry, and it's available, and it has a whole range to it that we can explore. We can learn what it is that nourishes that. This _is, is, is_ available to us.</span>
