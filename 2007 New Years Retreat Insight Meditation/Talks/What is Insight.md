##### This talk is about putting things in place
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1229 What is Insight > ^1-2" data-href="1229 What is Insight#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (4) · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11972/20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=00:02" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So the theme I would like to explore this evening is <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>. Just to go into what that means. What is <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>? What does that mean when we talk about <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>, when we talk about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">insight meditation</a>? Very much what I want to do in this talk is give an overview, very much of an overview, so big, big picture. I want to offer some of the avenues of possibility for how <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> deepens, and what that process is, can be - some of the possibilities. And to really give, what I want to do is to give a <a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a>. So it's very much about just kind of putting things in place.</span>

##### Different personality types react differently to conceptual frameworks
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1229 What is Insight > ^1-3" data-href="1229 What is Insight#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Personality types" class="internal-link">Personality types</a> (2) · <a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a> · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11972/20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=00:57" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Right from the start, I'm aware that there are, you could say, different <a data-href="personality types" class="internal-link">personality types</a>, in terms of how people learn. And so for some people, having an overview, having a <a data-href="Conceptual framework" class="internal-link">Conceptual framework</a> of how things fit together, and kind of what goes where, and how it all works together, they feel inside themselves that that's really necessary, and without that, they feel just totally disoriented on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>. Other people, other <a data-href="personality types" class="internal-link">personality types</a> or learning types, whatever, are actually confused when you start talking about an overview. So it's a tricky situation. [laughs] But this talk is an overview talk. And so I hope you can bear with that, if it's not your style.</span>

##### Talking about the deep end of the path can feel daunting
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1229 What is Insight > ^1-4" data-href="1229 What is Insight#^1-4" class="internal-link">1-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> (3) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Personality types" class="internal-link">Personality types</a> · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11972/20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=01:50" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">I also want to cover a lot of territory tonight, so got about an hour. [laughs] Just go right from kind of the beginnings of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>, the most basic sort of ideas of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>, right all the way to the end, to the final kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a>. And that, too, I'm also aware, again, of <a data-href="personality types" class="internal-link">personality types</a> here, and just how people respond to that. But please, do use this talk to get your bearings, in a sense, and have a sense of where you're navigating. But I'm well aware that some of what I talk about towards the end of the talk will be, as I said, about the sort of deep end of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>, and as such, will be not yet in the realm of probably most people's <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> in this room. It _is_ in the realm of some people's <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>; I know that. And just, what does the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> do when it hears that kind of stuff? Do we feel inspired? Do we feel daunted? Does the measuring, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind" data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">comparing mind</a> come up? "Oh god, I'll never get there. I'm hopeless. I can't _da-da-da-da-da."_ And we compare where we feel we are to whatever we're hearing about. So just to, as I'm talking tonight, just to please be aware of how you're listening, what you're bringing to the listening.</span>

##### General definition of insight: that which brings lessening of suffering
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1229 What is Insight > ^1-5" data-href="1229 What is Insight#^1-5" class="internal-link">1-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (12) · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (7) · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> (2) · <a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11972/20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=03:15" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Okay. <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> - this word, '<a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>': very, very general kind of definition we could give is, what is <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>? Any seeing or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> that brings the dissolution or the dissolving or a decrease in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dissatisfaction</a>, in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dis-ease</a>, in what we call <a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a>. So any seeing or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> that brings just an ease, some easing or completely dissolving of <a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a> - that's what we call <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>. Now, that can happen intellectually, but if it's just an intellectual <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>, and it doesn't lead to this easing, this lessening of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, it doesn't actually count or qualify as an <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>. So that applies - this "What is an <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>?," that which brings the lessening of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> - it applies to any situation, and any <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> whatsoever. ==Any situation, any <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, you can apply <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> to, <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> is relevant.== And the range is extreme - on one level, we could say, from the most mundane sort of everyday <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a> that don't even feel like they have a lot to do with <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> or whatever, to the most subtle, and the most profound and - whatever you want to say - transcendent.</span>

<div class="admonition quote"><div class="title">❝</div><div class="content">
So any seeing or understanding that brings just an ease, some easing or completely dissolving of dukkha - that's what we call "insight." Now, that can happen intellectually, but if it's just intellectual understanding, and it doesn't lead to this easing, this lessening of suffering, it doesn't actually count or qualify as an insight.<br/>

##### Example: talking to someone in an accusing way
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1229 What is Insight > ^2-1" data-href="1229 What is Insight#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (2) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11972/20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=04:46" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So an example of something that we could call more mundane or whatever, but very, very important, would be, I notice, you notice, we notice that when I have a difficulty with someone else, in relationship, whether I know that person or not, when I talk to them and express the difficulty I'm having, and I talk in an accusing way - "You _da-da-da-da-da_," and I tell that person how they are, usually there's an increase in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. Doesn't usually help. Occasionally it might, but usually it doesn't help to talk to a person that way. So just pulling any old basic example out of the hat. The <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> there is, "Okay, if I want to actually address this and bring about a calming of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in the situation, well, I need to not talk accusingly. I need to just refrain from trying to tell a person how they are." Just very, very basic, very, very simple - turns out to be quite difficult for a lot of us. But still, it's there. [5:52]</span>

##### 3 kinds of insights
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1229 What is Insight > ^2-2" data-href="1229 What is Insight#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (2) · <a data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">Ways of looking</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11972/20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=05:52" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">One of my teachers had a way of kind of conceptualizing of <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>, and talked about a possible <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of looking</a> at it. Three kinds of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a>: **(1)** the **personal**, **(2)** the **universal**, and **(3)** the **ultimate**. There are three kinds, and in a way, they're separate. In a way, they're not so separate.</span>

---
##### Personal insight into one's own habits of body, speech and mind
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1229 What is Insight > ^2-3" data-href="1229 What is Insight#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> (4) · <a data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">Habit</a> (4) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11972/20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=06:17" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">**(1)** What does **<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">personal insight</a>** mean? What does it mean to have <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> on a personal level? This means knowing, inquiring into and knowing one's own <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">particular patterns</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">tendencies</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a> of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, of speech, of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>. And again, this could be anything. So I have a friend, and in the context of her relationship, actually, with her husband, she notices - and this, I think she said this has been going on quite a while - that when her husband expresses a need, just a simple need like, "Oh, I'd like a cup of tea as well," or whatever, sometimes she doesn't even hear it. [laughter] It's not actually as big a problem as that might sound. It's just a little kind of niggle in their relationship. So they're both practitioners, and quite - to see that, to know that, is <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>. There's this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">particular pattern</a>. There's this particular tendency. And then, just to know that. So okay, that's an <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> into, in this case, a personal situation.</span>

---
##### Be really alive in your inquiry into your personal tendencies
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1229 What is Insight > ^2-4" data-href="1229 What is Insight#^2-4" class="internal-link">2-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">Habit</a> (2) · <a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">Dukkha</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11972/20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=07:30" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Or one might see, "In a situation of disagreement with another, my tendency is always to assume that I'm wrong and the other person is right, that I don't know. Or often to assume that." Or the other way around: "To assume I'm always right. I always know what's best. And they're always wrong. People don't see as clearly as I do." So all kinds of examples possible here. But the general thrust to really be alive in our inquiry into our personal <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">tendencies</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Habit" data-href="Habit" class="internal-link">habits</a>, our personal kind of make-up. Not with any judgment. It's not about judging. It's just about, going back to the beginning, what I said, <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> is about what frees us from <a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a>, frees us from <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dissatisfaction</a>, what helps - basically, what helps.</span>

---
##### Be aware of both personal weaknesses and strenghts
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1229 What is Insight > ^2-5" data-href="1229 What is Insight#^2-5" class="internal-link">2-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">Insight</a> · <a data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">Metta</a> · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">Steadiness</a> · <a data-href="Psychological maturity" class="internal-link">Psychological maturity</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/11972/20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=08:24" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">personal insight</a> also includes: what are my particular weaknesses? What are my particular strengths? Now, this is an interesting one, because oftentimes, for many of us, we're more aware of our weaknesses than our strengths: "Oh, I can't do that. I haven't got that together." And then we hear teachings or whatever about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, and <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a>, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">calmness</a>, and we think, "Well, I haven't got that, I haven't got that, I haven't got." And we're aware of the things that we don't have, our weaknesses. But are we also aware of our strengths? This is quite some, you could say, some <a data-href="psychological maturity" class="internal-link">psychological maturity</a>, to just know, "What do I need to work on? And what's actually pretty good with me?"</span>

<span class="paragraph">So again, many examples here. A person could be - and I'm not saying they have to be one or the other here - but a person could have a lot of access to their emotional lives. They know what they're feeling. They're in touch with that. They're able to express that. They feel the fullness, the beauty, the richness of that. And I'm not saying it follows from that at all, but they could have a particular weakness of, say, while that's there with the emotional life, not being so clear in situations - being, maybe, _too_ led by their emotions. (I'm really not saying those two go together.) Or the other way around: a person can be very clear, very analytical, and actually not have so much access to the depth and the richness of the life of the emotions. Just to know: what's the weakness, what's the strength, what needs some work? What's a strength? Do we know, do we acknowledge and appreciate our strengths? Really, really important. [10:01]</span>

##### Are the personal stories we tell ourselves helpful or unhelpful?

<span class="paragraph">So this, the realm of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">personal insight</a>, <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> into our <a data-href="personhood" class="internal-link">personhood</a>, our personality, so to speak, also includes the whole realm of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">our story</a> - so the story that we tell ourselves, the <a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a> that we tell ourselves and others about ourselves, about our life, about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">our journey</a>. So this is a very, very significant area. It can be - and I'm sure you know, just hearing <a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a>, or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fantasy" data-href="Fantasy" class="internal-link">mythological stories</a>, how beautiful <a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a> can be, how touching, how opening, how, actually, revealing of <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> they can be. <a data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">Stories</a> can be very, very beautiful. They can be helpful, absolutely they can be helpful. And they can be unhelpful. And so this inquiry, this <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>, this inquiry into our own story needs to ask this question: the <a data-href="stories" class="internal-link">stories</a> that I'm telling myself about myself, about my life - are they helpful, or are they unhelpful?

<span class="paragraph">It may well be that telling myself <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">a certain story</a> of my upbringing, of my childhood, of my journey, that through the telling of that story, I actually embrace aspects of myself, I open to aspects of myself that I otherwise might shut out. And the story's helping to open that. It's <a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a>. It's reclaiming something. But it can also be, or it can be at a later time, that we get stuck in a story, stuck in telling ourselves a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Stories" data-href="Stories" class="internal-link">narrative</a> or something about how we are, about where we've come from, etc. We get stuck and over-identified with that. This is a very difficult area, not easy to kind of navigate this and balance this and inquire into this. It's something that's actually, I think, important for all of us. I don't think anyone is exempt from this, this inquiry. ==Is the story helpful? And if so, how? And is it not helpful? And if so, how? And is it possible to actually tell myself a different story, to rewrite my story? And actually, yes, that is possible.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">We can talk, in the process of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>, as we walk <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>, wherever we are on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>, wherever we are, we can talk about <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a> arising. We say, "I _had_ an <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>," or "I _got_ an <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>. I _got_ something." And so, one very common approach to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a> is just to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a> the <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a>, just to be steady in one's <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to, one's presence to the <a data-href="present moment" class="internal-link">present moment</a>, and just trust that <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a>. And of course the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> goes, and we bring it back, and it goes, and we bring it back. Something can potentially happen through just devoting oneself to <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a>, to presence, to being here fully. And in the climate of that <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a>, even if it doesn't feel like great <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a>, perfect <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> - whatever that is - even if it doesn't feel like that, "Oh! Some <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>." Again, over the whole range, could be very, very simple, to do with anything, mundane, whatever.

##### "Insights arising" vs "using insights"

<span class="paragraph">So there's, we can say, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a> _arising_, and then another mode, which is what I would call _using_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a> or _consolidating_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">insights</a>. I'll try and explain what I mean by this. Sometimes in our practice, whether <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a> or off <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a>, we see something. Could be anything. I see the importance to imbue my communications with <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>. I see the importance of <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a> of judgmentalism, whatever it is. We see that, and it feels really clear. Or we see <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a>, and it feels really clear: "I see it. Everything's changing." And we see it crystal clear: "Aha!" Sometimes, it's done there. It's finished, done, that's it, you can retire that <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> and just live off its interest in the inner bank. ==Usually, though, it takes some acting on. You actually need to consolidate it.==</span>

##### To consolidate the insight needs us to act on it

<span class="paragraph">So we have this great clarity, whether it's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">on retreat</a> or whatever it is. I see the importance of being more kind to myself - whatever it is. And then, a little time goes by, and that <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> fades. We lose touch with that <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a>. We feel like we're back where we were. Very important: to consolidate, to deepen the <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>, actually needs, very often, us to _act_ on it. So even when the sense of it, the <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a> has changed, one asks oneself, "I don't feel it right now. But I remember having that <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>. What if I acted now? What if I chose now in my life as if I knew that was true, because I know what I saw there was more true than all this, whatever seems real now? I know that what I saw about the importance of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> or <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a> or whatever it is - I know that was true. I don't feel it now. What if I took a risk and just acted on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Devotion" data-href="Devotion" class="internal-link">faith</a>, made a choice, made choices that lived out that <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>?" In other words, how we are with people and things, with ourselves, etc.</span>

##### Insight is like a muscle, if we don't use it it will atrophy

<span class="paragraph">Very often, we have an insight, but it actually leaves us kind of sitting on a fence. And we can flop back down into the familiar, and the known, and the momentum of our habits from the past, or we can just nudge ourselves and flop down into the new, into a life lived from the place of that insight. That may look dramatically different. It may look dramatically different. What if one had really deep insight into, say, the power of love, the importance of love, the importance of generosity, and then just said, "Right, I'm really going to live that out"? It could be something very, very undramatic. Insight is a bit like a muscle. If we don't use it, it will atrophy. It will atrophy and fade. [26:27] We need to kind of keep it alive, to consolidate it.</span>

##### Another way to consolidate the insight is to use it as a mode of seeing

<span class="paragraph">So there's this, as I said, insight arising, just arising out of mindfulness. And there's also this acting on, using and consolidating. But there's another way that we can use and consolidate an insight. And that's, rather, using insight as a kind of mode of seeing. Remember, what I'm doing tonight is I'm just creating conceptual frameworks. I'm hoping this is helpful. A mode of seeing. I'll explain what I mean by that. What would it be - say, impermanence - to, rather than just wait for a sense of impermanence and the ricochets of that, the reverberations of that, what would it be to actually look at one's experience, just being interested in impermanence? Put that on as a lens, a way of seeing, as a practice. So this is moving beyond what we might call simple mindfulness or simple presence or being, and actually deliberately taking up a certain mode of seeing, a certain way of looking at experience, for a period of time - a sitting, or half a sitting, or a day, or you know, a retreat, or whatever it is, or a year.</span>

<span class="paragraph">I'll talk more about this, but we can talk then about insight as a kind of result, just sitting, being here, and just present, and just open, and there pops the insight. Can talk about insight as a result. And we can talk about insight as - I can't really find the words - a process of using insight. I'll go into it a bit more. But both of these are important. And again, it's interesting, just in the realm of maybe personality differences, etc., where we tend to go with that. So some people always want to just _be_, and just let things arise, and some people are always kind of probing and trying to look differently, or a tendency either way. Both are important, and I would say, maybe not just one way. Maybe not just one way.</span>

<span class="paragraph">But with this '<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">modes of seeing</a>' - and I'm going to go, as I said, more into it right now - we can think, if you hear about that, "Okay, putting on a different lens.

I'm not really together enough, got all these <a data-href="emotions" class="internal-link">emotions</a> going on, not ready for that." Or, "I just want to be. I just want to be."

##### Whenever there is dukkha, the unawakened mind does something unnecessary to itself

<span class="paragraph">What that means is, whenever there is any <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dissatisfaction</a> at all, any <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dis-ease</a>, any discomfort, any <a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a>, basically, any <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, any at all, can ask oneself a question: how am I contributing to this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>? How am I perhaps even sustaining it? At first that might sound like an odd question, because some sufferings that we're in, "This has nothing to do with me. I'm an innocent victim of this illness, of this situation, of this political situation, whatever it is." And it's not to ignore the importance of all that. But it's a safe assumption that, until we're completely awakened, whenever there is <a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a>, whenever there's even the subtlest <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dis-ease</a>, discomfort, that the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samadhi" data-href="Samadhi" class="internal-link">unawakened mind</a> does something or some things to add to it unnecessarily. It's actually compounding <a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a>, compounding <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dissatisfaction</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Again, whole range of examples, but one is something like grumbling. So we're in a situation, we're annoyed with someone or something. Dharmically speaking, we have two options, really. One is, can I find a way of working with this that actually I let go? The situation remains, and I <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">just let go</a>. I've let go inside. Or, can I do something to address the situation? Can I bring a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a>, a skilfulness of communication, a care of communication to this person that I'm upset with? And can I solve the situation that way, or do something, make some changes in the world that are skilful and appropriate? So either I let go or I do something. Unfortunately, oftentimes, we find ourselves just, neither this nor that, and just sitting there grumbling to people who are sort of willing to hear. Grumbling is not helpful. It's actually leading to more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. It's a very obvious example, in a way, and a crass example, but it's important to see this. What am I doing that's actually compounding <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, adding a layer of unnecessary <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> there?</span>

<span class="paragraph">Again, the story that I'm telling myself about the situation, about myself, whatever, is that increasing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> in some way?

##### Be aware of subtle kind of delusions of awareness

<span class="paragraph">Now, sometimes, as I'm sure you'll recognize as I've just said that, sometimes we know we're doing this stuff. We actually know. We know that we're grumbling and it's not helping. It's not _that_ deep an <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>. But somehow we just keep doing it. This is the interesting thing about <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>. What is it that's going to make the change? There's no judgment in this question, because as I said, until one is completely awakened, you can pretty much safely assume that the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> will be adding something to a situation that feels difficult, adding some unnecessary <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> to it - guaranteed. Some of it is going to be pretty gross and fairly easy to uncover. Others, it's extremely subtle - so to the most subtle kind of intentions and conceptions, delusions of <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>.</span>

<span class="paragraph">**(1) Impermanence**, the first one, I don't know if you would agree, but I would say that to most human beings over the age of - what, I don't know, four, or five? I'm not sure - impermanence is actually pretty obvious. It's a pretty obvious fact of our life. Remember, if we're interested in insight, it's got to make a difference. It's got to make a difference to how we relate and how we live. So yes, impermanence is obvious. But are we seeing it in a way that makes a difference? Using this mode of seeing - actually just coming out of that very lovely mode of just being mindful. I maybe skipped over that too quickly. Something very beautiful, very precious, and extremely important about just giving attention, just coming back, just being here, just being mindful, devoting oneself to that. A real preciousness and beauty in that way of being, way of practising, and trusting that out of that, the insights will come. I really want to stress that.</span>

<span class="paragraph"><a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a> - there are many ways of working with it, so oftentimes, what gets stressed is very, very microscopic noticing of <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a>, moment to moment to moment, just seeing change, change, change, very, very fast. Or one can just go through one's day. And you can do that here, so there's an invitation: what would it be to get up tomorrow morning, and just say, "This day, I'm really going to focus in on change"? You take up - the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s words - you take up your theme. And one sees the change in the visual forms. Look: visual form, changing. It's just changing. All through the day, changing visual form, all through the day, changing emotional climate, all through the day. Do I go to bed in the same mood as I got up? Has it stayed the same all day? All through the day, changing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a>, changing sounds.

<span class="paragraph">So sometimes, and particularly with the impermanence contemplation, you read in the commentaries - not actually originally what the Buddha said, but you read in the commentaries that if one contemplates impermanence, one will start getting really freaked out, and really upset, and really agitated, and disgusted with life, and horrified, and very afraid, etc. I don't think that's how insight works. I think, going back to right what I said at the beginning, the mark of insight is that it brings a sense of freedom. It brings of sense of joy. So I'm talking about modes of seeing that we can pick up and use, that lead to a sense of freedom. [40:18] If they lead to a sense of agitation or confusion existentially, or all the rest of it, torment - wrong! Put it away! Do something else. So if we contemplate impermanence, to ask oneself: am I contemplating it in a way that's actually helpful, that's leading to freedom, to that sense? Okay, so there's impermanence. There's the first characteristic, the first mode of seeing.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Another aspect of this <a data-href="dukkha" class="internal-link">dukkha</a> <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> or mode of seeing is actually learning - and we'll probably talk about this tomorrow morning - learning to uncouple, to relax the <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> or the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">grasping</a> that we have to our <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, and to things that come up.

<span class="paragraph">**(3)** Third one is this **not-self**. So I'm really not going to go into this in a big way, but just to say, that's also a mode of seeing. And with practice, there's the possibility: instead of identifying with everything that comes up, identify with my body sensations, identify with my emotions, "They're me," or "They're mine," identify with my thoughts, "They're me," or "They're mine," one learns to practise letting go, letting go of identification, regarding things as not-self. Again, it's a lens that one puts on, this not-self. It's not me, not mine. And in that, there's a letting go, a very beautiful letting go. It's not at all about disconnection, or dissociation, or numbing out, or anything like that. It's practising a mode of seeing, a certain lens. Everything that comes up, can we practise with that way?</span>

<span class="paragraph">Earlier today, I feel like I'm also getting ill in some manner. And there was a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pain" data-href="Pain" class="internal-link">headache</a>, and I was sitting. And this goes back to this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">push and pull</a> thing. I just want to drop this in there as a little titbit. What happens - the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pain" data-href="Pain" class="internal-link">headache</a> comes up. Natural, or you could say, normal reaction of <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a> is to want to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">push it away</a>. Want to get rid of this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pain" data-href="Pain" class="internal-link">headache</a>, quite intense, unpleasant. I've seen this before, but found that if I work with just relaxing the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a>, just opening, just allowing, relaxing the <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>, <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> came. <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> came. The <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a> was actually blocking a sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>, of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, of warmth, of openness. So again, one could take that up, and use that as a way to practise <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">mettā</a>. I just sit here, and I <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Letting go" data-href="Letting go" class="internal-link">just let go</a> of <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>, and the heart - again, you can see this; you can experiment with this in your practice, over the years, really - lets go of <a data-href="aversion" class="internal-link">aversion</a>, and the warmth comes. The heart opens. More <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> comes. [50:00] So all these <a data-href="three characteristics" class="internal-link">three characteristics</a>, we see, if we practise them as <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">modes of seeing</a>, they absolutely lead to a sense of less <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. The <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a> just drains out.

<span class="paragraph">So let's backtrack a little bit.

<span class="paragraph">So what one sees is that the more entanglement, the more the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">push and pull</a>, the more the fighting with <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, the more prominent that <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> is. You can see this when there's a lot of story, a lot of entanglement, how big that thing seems in <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>, whatever it is. Let go a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, and the thing fades. For example, a <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a> in the knee, you can see it. Or <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a> of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>: <a data-href="letting go" class="internal-link">letting go</a> of identification actually leads to a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fading</a> of the <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>. The more that's there, the more <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a> is there, the more the <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> is there. Less it's there, less the <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> is there. This is completely counterintuitive, totally and utterly counterintuitive. We tend to believe in a world that's out there, that exists independent of how I relate to it and look at it.</span>

##### There is no _one_ amount of craving which reveals how the world is

<span class="paragraph">One could ask - okay, so I see, the more I <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">push and pull</a>, the more entangled I am, the more prominent the world appears. The less, the less. And as it gets less and less, less and less prominent the world appears. And when there's no pushing/pulling at all, no <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> arises. And one might ask, "Well, which amount of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">pushing and pulling</a> reveals the real way the world is?" Can't actually find it. The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> said the <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a> of things is that they dependently arise. So we can develop - as I said at the beginning - avenues, avenues of possibility on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>. One is to develop these <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">modes of seeing</a>. They actually develop from those <a data-href="three characteristics" class="internal-link">three characteristics</a> into other ones. And you can pick them up and just go further, go deeper. And it's all available for us.</span>

<span class="paragraph">One eventually - if we talk about what's sort of the final <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a>, so to speak, one sees more and more that all things, including <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, <a data-href="consciousness" class="internal-link">consciousness</a>, or <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, or whatever you want to call it, including things like space and like time, ==absolutely everything that we take for granted, is actually built and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Fabrication" data-href="Fabrication" class="internal-link">fabricated</a> by my relationship to it, by the way I'm looking at it.

<span class="paragraph">There was a seeker called <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kaccayana" data-href="Kaccayana" class="internal-link">Kaccāyana</a>. And he approached the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> one time, and he said, "What is this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a>? And what's the right <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Ways of looking" data-href="Ways of looking" class="internal-link">way of seeing</a> things?" And the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> said ordinary beings - in other words, unawakened beings - think dualistically. They conceive in terms of dualisms. They conceive that their self and the things around their self either exist or don't exist. They say "it is" or "it is not." They think dualistically in terms of "it is" and "it is not." So things and situations are really real, or really not real. Because of that, there's <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a>. Because of that fundamental <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Avijja" data-href="Avijja" class="internal-link">delusion</a>, there's <a data-href="clinging" class="internal-link">clinging</a>, and then there's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. It's out of that that there's <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>, and the whole realm of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dis-ease</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">dissatisfaction</a>, the whole realm of what's called <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Samsara" data-href="Samsara" class="internal-link">saṃsāra</a>. But he said, for those with <a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a> into _how -_ stressing that word _how -_ <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Phenomenon" data-href="Phenomenon" class="internal-link">phenomena</a> arise, to _how_ they sustain, and to _how_ they cease (that is, this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dependent Origination" data-href="Dependent Origination" class="internal-link">dependent arising</a> I'm talking about), there is no "is," and there is no "is not." He said - a quote from the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>: =="That things exist, O <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Kaccayana" data-href="Kaccayana" class="internal-link">Kaccāyana</a>, is one extreme.

<span class="paragraph">So I'm not sure how that sounds. It probably sounds very different ways to different people. It's really, really, really not <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nihilism" data-href="Nihilism" class="internal-link">nihilistic</a>. So it can be easy to hear that teaching and feel it's very destructive, very <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nihilism" data-href="Nihilism" class="internal-link">nihilistic</a>. It's really not. ==The deeper we go into this - and it's a very gradual thing, it's a very gradual process - the deeper we go into it, the more <a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a> is liberated, the more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Happiness" data-href="Happiness" class="internal-link">joy</a>, the more peace, the more <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> and <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> are liberated.== And even that is actually a real possibility for us. It's totally a real possibility for us on this path. It's the promise of this path that it can deliver.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Okay. That's it. [laughs] So going back to what I said at the beginning: big overview, did it in just an hour, okay? Big overview, right from very, very basic, right all the way - how is it to hear all that? Just wanted to paint a little bit of a roadmap, and just see how that is. This is the map, some possibilities of the map. Can I just ...? Maybe it's helpful. Maybe not. Maybe it gets bearings, and maybe not.</span>
