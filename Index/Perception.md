> No perception, no mind. They go together. To have a mind, you need to have a perception. If there's no world, there's no perception and no mind. The mind is inextricably linked up with what it perceives, which is the universe. Mind is not separate from the world. It feels separate. Self feels separate from others, from the world, from the universe. Mind feels separate. This is the great delusion. Not separate. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Non-separation as corrolary to the mind having perceptions" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Non-separation as corrolary to the mind having perceptions" class="internal-link">Non-separation as corrolary to the mind having perceptions</a>_</span>

> So what we notice is, if we change the view, the perception changes. The irritability goes from the situation. How we see the situation and how we see a person depends on what the mind is bringing to it - mettā, compassion, irritability, what I want, whatever it is. And the mind's always bringing something. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Changing the perception can make the irritability go away from the situation" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Changing the perception can make the irritability go away from the situation" class="internal-link">Changing the perception can make the irritability go away from the situation</a>_</span>

> But we begin to see: the appearance of something depends on the grasping. So there is no thing, there is no real thing that is independent of grasping, of clinging, of what the mind is doing with it. No thing, no problem. If a thing isn't real, it can't be a real problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > The appearance of something depends on the grasping" data-href="Love and Emptiness#The appearance of something depends on the grasping" class="internal-link">The appearance of something depends on the grasping</a>_</span>

> There's a kind of grasping that goes on with attention. But we can also see that we can be paying attention to something, and then when we let go of a lot of grasping, that thing that we're paying attention to actually begins to blur and to fade... Grasping is part of perception... No grasping, no perception. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob attention is kind of like prongs" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob attention is kind of like prongs" class="internal-link">Rob: attention is kind of like prongs</a>_</span>

> My take on it, as well, is that a person can be awakened to some degree, and there's basically a momentum of saṅkhāras, of karmic momentum, to basically perceive things and things existing really. And that momentum for the duration of their life is enough to keep the world appearing for them. And then, theoretically, when they die, it all kind of dissolves into whatever it does. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob Maybe only Buddhas can see emptiness and not bump into things" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob Maybe only Buddhas can see emptiness and not bump into things" class="internal-link">Rob: Maybe only Buddhas can see emptiness and not bump into things</a>_</span>

> So this practice that we've been doing this week, with directing kindness towards things, and sometimes the things fade - one actually sees that, through the lack of kindness or the lack of acceptance, a perception is actually getting built, it's getting fabricated or compounded, to use the Buddha's words, constructed in the moment. Without the mind doing something, that perception cannot be there. So something, whatever's going on, is just a perception. It's just fabricated. It's empty, in other words. It's empty. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Practice seeing things as just perceptions" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Practice seeing things as just perceptions" class="internal-link">Practice: seeing things as just perceptions</a>_</span>

> That principle is something that applies to all consciousnesses - not even just human beings; all consciousnesses. Whenever there's a consciousness, the appearance of things to that consciousness depends on the push and the pull, the relationship with. And that's universal.
