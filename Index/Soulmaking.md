> In a way, I'm offering these particular teachings now, offering them so that there's the possibility that you can practise, and practise in a way that you don't end up regretting, that you don't end up regretting not supporting yourself fully, or allowing yourself or enabling yourself fully to move in the direction or be moved in the direction of what _you_ want with respect to [[Soulmaking|Soulmaking Dharma]], and also what you want with respect to <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a> in life, the expression and the living of soul in life, _your_ soul in _your_ life. We must call that Soulmaking Dharma; it's not something separate. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2 > So practice in a way that you dont end up regretting" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#So practice in a way that you don't end up regretting" class="internal-link">So practice in a way that you don&#x27;t end up regretting</a>_</span>

> Beautiful as the <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> of that week can be, or some of the experiences on that week can be, and touching, might it be that something more steady - courses, classes, groups, etc. - actually provide maybe not _more_ support, but a different kind of support, and a necessary kind of support for making a real, more long-term difference in terms of <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a> and soulmaking and what soul needs?

> Oftentimes it's the 'making' that people don't relate to, the word 'making.' Of course, if you understand the whole track of exploration of <a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a> and <a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a> ('fabrication' is just another word for 'making'), and how that deepens, and how it opens out, and the understanding it opens out, then the word 'making' is almost an indispensable word in 'soulmaking.' But for a lot of people, it's very puzzling, because you'd usually think of the word 'soul,' or have a sense of soul, or use that in a very reified way: it wouldn't be something that we _make_. It would be something that _is_, or we discover, or that just is a level of being or whatever. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > A teacher said I dont really relate to the word soul" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#A teacher said I don't really relate to the word 'soul'" class="internal-link">A teacher said: &quot;I don&#x27;t really relate to the word &#x27;soul&#x27;&quot;</a>_</span>
