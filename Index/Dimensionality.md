> [E]veryone uses the word self: I, you, self, etc. And everyone experiences selves. Everyone experiences selves - their own self or selves, and the selves of others. It's just the same, or rather it's similar with the notion of divinity. We're talking about experience, okay? Just as 'self' is a word that we use, an experience, so is 'divinity' - or rather, 'divinity' is a whole range of experiences, a whole range of dimensions of experiences, if you like, that will become evident, that will appear in one's experience, _if_ we do not block, dismiss, or rule it out. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > Divinity is a whole range of experiences" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Divinity is a whole range of experiences" class="internal-link">&quot;Divinity&quot; is a whole range of experiences</a>_</span>

> [E]ros, wanting more, it deepens and creates/discovers more to the image, gives more imaginal dimensions, imaginal complexity, imaginal facets and faces to this beloved other, and in that, the idea, the logos, also, of this other expands. That eros-psyche-logos, that soulmaking dynamic, then comes back, because the object then is more beautiful, more deep, more rich, more juicy, more enticing, more complex. It offers me more. It offers more for the psyche, so to speak, to move into, to expand, but also for the eros to find attractive and to want more of. So there's this way that it kind of, potentially infinitely, in a way, just expands. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4 > Eros psyche logos they all help each other" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros psyche logos they all help each other" class="internal-link">Eros, psyche, logos, they all help each other</a>_</span>

> We have all kinds of reasons and social taboos and cultural conditionings and whatnot, and contractions of being, and psychology - it's harder to have that, to recognize the beauty and the dimensionality, and to have an erotic relationship with oneself. So one kind of externalizes it by just making it image. Don't worry if it's not imaginal at first. It can very soon _become_ imaginal, more fully imaginal, with the eros there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Sometimes its easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when its externalized like that" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Sometimes it's easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it's externalized like that" class="internal-link">Sometimes it&#x27;s easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it&#x27;s externalized like that</a>_</span>

> The self needs to become image. It wants to become image. Soul wants to make things imaginal, to discover their imaginal dimensions. And it needs to imprint. It wants to express itself. It wants to connect with other souls. This is how soul grows. Soulmaking _is_ being impressed upon.

> So sometimes connecting with an image and recognizing, feeling, opening to its love for us, it's so tailored and so tailored to our being and our particularities, and so attuned to us and empowered by the dimensionality and the divinity and the beauty, etc., that, in a way, that kind of love, the love that images have for us, that profound and almost mysterious, mysteriously attuned love, it can heal the inner critic and that whole painful constellation almost more powerfully, I think, than anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > The love images have for us can heal the inner critic" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#The love images have for us can heal the inner critic" class="internal-link">The love images have for us can heal the inner critic</a>_</span>
