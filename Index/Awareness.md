> In that climate of compassion, with a little bit more broad awareness, it's like a lens of looking at the present moment, the present experience, through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering, in the moment. So we begin to see little sufferings, little ways that we're creating suffering. And organically somehow, because of the compassion practice, we can just unhook. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Looking at the present experience through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Looking at the present experience through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering" class="internal-link">Looking at the present experience, through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering</a>_</span>

> Dharma is one of these words that can have a lot of different meanings.

> And there's complete welcoming, complete acceptance. So what's being emphasized here is the love, the acceptance. Absolute, radical acceptance.

> [M]ake the mindfulness a bit bigger, meaning make the range of the awareness a bit bigger.

> When we get too tight, what happens? We actually feel it in the body. So part of the art of meditation, part of the art of deepening _samādhi_, is to have this kind of background awareness of breadth of the body awareness, and be sensitive to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice > ad 2 tightness" data-href="The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#ad 2 tightness" class="internal-link">ad 2. tightness</a>_</span>

> And our life involves an incredible amount of uncertainty and change. That's the nature, that's the fabric of our existence. And they, like us, are subject to that. So just holding this lightly, this sense of _anicca_ that they are vulnerable to, holding that in the awareness very lightly, as one's doing the _mettā_, can either kick-start the _mettā_ when it feels like it's a little bit blocked or it can't really get off the ground... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > a Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#a Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life" class="internal-link">a) Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life</a>_</span>

> And putting the awareness, just gently keep putting it other places - belly, heart centre, etc. And the more you do that with that sensitivity, the more the energy, the more the awareness kind of rests there, takes its centre there.

> Buddha-nature, _dharmakāya_, emptiness, the Absolute, and other words (there are quite a few words that are used interchangeably), means something like the cosmic awareness that is inherently in me and in you and in everything, that knows the emptiness of all things, is not separate (as separating subjects and objects).

> We're talking about an energy body sense - expanding, moving, and feeling, sensing and imagining not just the space of the energy body in its usual size, but also the extended sense of the energy in the room, and how that's connected with and impacted by and filled by the energy of your body movements. It's more than just the space of awareness.

There's a bit of <a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a>, or even a lot of anxiety about looking silly or whatever it is, or sounding silly."
