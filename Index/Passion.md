> [N]either that chocolate cake investigation or the tea investigation, nor the deep investigation into dependent arising and emptiness that I explained, will be enough for understanding and opening out and giving nourishment and life, and structure and vision, and opening doors in the realm, in the direction, of the soul-passions or the subtle movements of eros. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > Nourishment life structure vision opening doors" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Nourishment life structure vision opening doors" class="internal-link">Nourishment, life, structure, vision, opening doors</a>_</span>

> And, conversely, the investigation of my soul-passions, and my desire in relation to that, and that kind of eros, whether it's really strong or much more subtle, won't be - it will actually tell me _something_ about dependent origination and emptiness, _something_, but not enough for the full monty there, the full depth of that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > Each of the three are different doors directions avenues" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Each of the three are different doors directions avenues" class="internal-link">Each of the three are different doors, directions, avenues</a>_</span>

> [T]hey can't postpone the soul-calling to include an exploration of eros fully, richly, deeply on the path. Can't postpone it. Not yet got all that more straight-ahead stuff figured out, but I can't postpone it either. Is that just the pull of delusion, the impatience of delusion? Not necessarily. There are some who actually don't do things in the order that a neat way of framing things might prefer.

> I cannot reduce a romantic love relationship or a marriage to _mettā_ . There's something more involved, or that needs to be involved.

> [A]s practitioners, we need to develop our sensitivity and the subtlety of our awareness to be able to notice mind states. If we're calling eros a mind state or a state of being, to develop the sensitivity to that without relying on the clues and cues of thoughts. Seeing how the energy body is affected, developing the sensitivity to that, to the textures of mind, and what we might call the space of mind, the subtle mental movements that are there even when there is no thought, or they're underneath or alongside thought. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2 > We need to develop the sensitivity to the texture of mind states and the space of mind" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#We need to develop the sensitivity to the texture of mind states and the space of mind" class="internal-link">We need to develop the sensitivity to the texture of mind states and the space of mind</a>_</span>
