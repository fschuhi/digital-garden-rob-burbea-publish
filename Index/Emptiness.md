> Seeing emptiness leads to love and compassion, because it's kind of done away with the reality of separation, with the reality of barriers, with the reality of real problems, real faults, with the investment we have in self-inflating or self-depreciation. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > The indicator for emptiness is love and freedom" data-href="Love and Emptiness#The indicator for emptiness is love and freedom" class="internal-link">The indicator for emptiness is love and freedom</a>_</span>

> There's a kind of grasping that goes on with attention. But we can also see that we can be paying attention to something, and then when we let go of a lot of grasping, that thing that we're paying attention to actually begins to blur and to fade... Grasping is part of perception... No grasping, no perception. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob attention is kind of like prongs" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob attention is kind of like prongs" class="internal-link">Rob: attention is kind of like prongs</a>_</span>

> So this practice that we've been doing this week, with directing kindness towards things, and sometimes the things fade - one actually sees that, through the lack of kindness or the lack of acceptance, a perception is actually getting built, it's getting fabricated or compounded, to use the Buddha's words, constructed in the moment. Without the mind doing something, that perception cannot be there. So something, whatever's going on, is just a perception. It's just fabricated. It's empty, in other words. It's empty. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Practice seeing things as just perceptions" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Practice seeing things as just perceptions" class="internal-link">Practice: seeing things as just perceptions</a>_</span>

> I was just being there, and the experience was getting more and more bright, more and more there, more and more present, more and more radiant. But if I keep letting go, it actually begins to fade. Experience itself begins to blur and dissolve and fade and become less prominent in consciousness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > When you dont stop there experience begins to fade" data-href="What is Insight#When you don't stop there experience begins to fade" class="internal-link">When you don&#x27;t stop there, experience begins to fade</a>_</span>

> It's pointing to seeing this: the more I cling in any way, the more prominent experience is in consciousness.

> I find nothing but perceptions, and they are inseparable, and in a way, it's seeing - it's a way that this impermanence can lead to an understanding of emptiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Those perceptions are not separate from the universe from the world" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Those perceptions are not separate from the universe from the world" class="internal-link">Those perceptions are not separate from the universe, from the world</a>_</span>

> Without belief in the self, there can't really be fear. Where is the fear going to take root? It's around self. When we begin to understand, deeply and in the heart, this emptiness of self, we realize there's actually nothing real here to protect, to defend, to worry about, and fear gets released at a very deep level in our lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > We want to understand something about what the self is and how it is in a way that brings freedom into our life" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We want to understand something about what the self is and how it is in a way that brings freedom into our life" class="internal-link">We want to understand something about what the self is, and how it is, in a way that brings freedom into our life</a>_</span>

> So you can play with kind of going into that emptiness, but not too much, so you still keep them around a bit. You kind of see that they're empty, but you also don't go too far into that - you can kind of pull them back and forth on this sliding scale of emptiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > 2 You can play with how formed you make someone" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#2 You can play with how formed you make someone" class="internal-link">(2) You can play with how formed you make someone</a>_</span>

> So you kind of make them somewhat empty, but not completely empty, so you've still got a sense of somewhere you can direct the _mettā_ towards. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > 2 You can play with how formed you make someone" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#2 You can play with how formed you make someone" class="internal-link">(2) You can play with how formed you make someone</a>_</span>

> What certain situations need is very relative, conventional language. We need to talk about our emotions; we need to express what we feel to each other; we need to respect that. I need to respect my emotions and your emotions at that level. So in that moment, that's what's helpful, that way of looking. But I'm saying a mature practice is able to move between picking that up, putting it down, picking up other ways of seeing - emptiness, _anattā_, etc. - and putting them down, not getting stuck in one or the other. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Maturity in practice comes from being able to move between different ways of seeing" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Maturity in practice comes from being able to move between different ways of seeing" class="internal-link">Maturity in practice comes from being able to move between different ways of seeing</a>_</span>

> Difficult things are held in place, basically, by aversion, by grasping, by identification, by all these things we're talking about letting go of. So as you let go of them, they tend to fade. Happiness, at one level, or peace, or joy, is also held in place by grasping, to an extent. But it's a more subtle kind of grasping. What one finds is that if one lets go of the grasping towards happiness, the happiness actually deepens. It becomes more refined. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > When we let go were actually taking away some of what is building an experience and it begins to fade" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#When we let go we're actually taking away some of what is building an experience and it begins to fade" class="internal-link">When we let go, we&#x27;re actually taking away some of what is building an experience, and it begins to fade</a>_</span>
