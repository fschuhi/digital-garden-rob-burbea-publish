> Big ideas can open up the whole sense of existence - the questioning, the perception, everything. That opening up won't happen just by 'being with,' or just by being with my feelings, if I'm 'being with' with the same unquestioned ways of looking, unquestioned conceptual framework, etc., unquestioned metaphysics, really. We somehow need to question and to put in new ideas. Somehow. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Questioning Awakening > Is a wholly different relationship with fundamental ideas possible" data-href="Questioning Awakening#Is a wholly different relationship with fundamental ideas possible" class="internal-link">Is a wholly different relationship with fundamental ideas possible?</a>_</span>

> Can I have a conceptual framework, can I form, can I open to a conceptual framework and a fantasy that, actually, romantic love becomes part of the path, and not just in those kind of simplistic terms? The concepts, if I try and stretch too small a set of concepts over the range of things that we deeply care about, the whole structure will snap. It's not adequate. It cannot support it. It cannot nourish those areas that we really care about, _if_ we really care about them. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > When I stretch a limited conceptual framework over things I care deeply about the whole structure will snap" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#When I stretch a limited conceptual framework over things I care deeply about the whole structure will snap" class="internal-link">When I stretch a limited conceptual framework over things I care deeply about, the whole structure will snap</a>_</span>

> [A]re there ways of conceiving, conceptual frameworks, relationships and investigations, that open otherwise closed doors for us?

> (A) we can't avoid conceptuality, and (B), actually conceptuality is necessary and part of the erotic movement.

> I was contrasting _poiesis_ and _logos_, but actually when I use the word 'logos' in the way _we're_ using it, we're not making a truth claim, other than that everything is empty, and even _that_, actually, you let go of at a certain point.

> What would it be to listen or read _for_ and _from_ the whole conceptual framework? I'm listening _for_, or I'm reading _for_, to get a sense of, what is the whole conceptual framework.
