> And there's complete welcoming, complete acceptance. So what's being emphasized here is the love, the acceptance. Absolute, radical acceptance. Not, as in a usual vipassanā practice or awareness practice, the precision, the clarity: "What exactly is going on? Can I see it moment to moment to moment?" &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Emphasis was on complete acceptance" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Emphasis was on complete acceptance" class="internal-link">Emphasis was on complete acceptance</a>_</span>

> There's nowhere outside of acceptance. There's nowhere outside of love. So if we feel resistance, if we feel non-acceptance, if we feel judging, if we feel numb - whatever it is, the love, the space of love, can just be bigger, bigger than that, and see that, too, and embrace that, too, and bathe that, too, in the kindness, in the complete welcoming. And this welcoming has to be, this total welcoming has to be as genuine as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Relaxing back into a space of metta" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Relaxing back into a space of metta" class="internal-link">Relaxing back into a space of metta</a>_</span>

> [W]hen I say, "If I'm loving myself, what am I?", one level of looking at it in terms of anattā is, I am just these experiences and my relationship with them. If that becomes one of more acceptance for all that, then it's a kind of self-love, absolutely. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob Anatta practice leads to more acceptance as a kind of self-love" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob Anatta practice leads to more acceptance as a kind of self-love" class="internal-link">Rob: Anatta practice leads to more acceptance, as a kind of self-love</a>_</span>

> So this practice that we've been doing this week, with directing kindness towards things, and sometimes the things fade - one actually sees that, through the lack of kindness or the lack of acceptance, a perception is actually getting built, it's getting fabricated or compounded, to use the Buddha's words, constructed in the moment. Without the mind doing something, that perception cannot be there. So something, whatever's going on, is just a perception. It's just fabricated. It's empty, in other words. It's empty. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Practice seeing things as just perceptions" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Practice seeing things as just perceptions" class="internal-link">Practice: seeing things as just perceptions</a>_</span>

> A wrong kind of self-attention feeds, builds the ego and builds the self-sense, whereas an attention that's full of compassion, full of tenderness, full of acceptance and care, full of insight into questioning, "How is it that this suffering has come about?" - that kind of direction of the attention towards self does not build the ego, will not build the ego, will actually soften things, will actually allow things to become looser and more spacious. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > Compassion to self does not build the ego" data-href="Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Compassion to self does not build the ego" class="internal-link">Compassion to self does not build the ego</a>_</span>
