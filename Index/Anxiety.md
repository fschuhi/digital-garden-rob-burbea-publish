> When anything comes up - whatever it is, anxiety or anything at all - there's conditioning from the past. As you say, this comes from the past. But that past conditioning is _not enough_ for it to arise in the present. A thing cannot arise in the present without me doing something as well in the present. And you _can't_ change the past, so to speak, but what we can do is understand, "What is it that I'm putting _in_ in the present which is sustaining or even allowing this thing to arise?" &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > Play with a sense of welcoming rather than wrapping fear in love" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#Play with a sense of welcoming rather than wrapping fear in love" class="internal-link">Play with a sense of welcoming, rather than wrapping fear in love</a>_</span>

> The mindfulness expands to include that: "Oh, okay. There's self-consciousness going on as well. There's a bit of <a data-href="anxiety" class="internal-link">anxiety</a>, or even a lot of anxiety about looking silly or whatever it is, or sounding silly." Can there be a bit more space in the consciousness? Because anxiety will contract the space of the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>. Sometimes just creating a bit more space can help. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > There might be self-consciousness arising" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#There might be self-consciousness arising" class="internal-link">There might be self-consciousness arising</a>_</span>
