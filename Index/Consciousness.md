> Human consciousness is programmed incredibly strongly to go to that default mode. What we begin to see in practice is that default way of seeing is not the reality. If we throw out what I would call the deeper senses of oneness, of an infinite love, whatever you want to call it, if we throw that out too quickly, we just go back to the default, and in a way, we're not challenging that default mode enough. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > But dont be in a hurry as the power of those kinds of perceptions transforms heart and mind" data-href="Love and Emptiness#But don't be in a hurry as the power of those kinds of perceptions transforms heart and mind" class="internal-link">But don&#x27;t be in a hurry, as the power of those kinds of perceptions transforms heart and mind</a>_</span>

> It's not that we're always going to stay in one state or another. It's something about being human, the amazing range of human consciousness. It's staggering, the capacity of the range of human consciousness to move along that whole spectrum. And somehow in that, and in accepting that movement, that's where our humanity is and our humility is. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > A continuum of love" data-href="Love and Emptiness#A continuum of love" class="internal-link">A continuum of love</a>_</span>

> So it's just whatever's in consciousness, whatever's prominent, there the mettā goes. And also quite quick to see what the relationship with things is. With practice, it just becomes very evident: there's some slight aversion here. And it's clear, and then the mettā comes in or the compassion or whatever. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob Both sensible and youll get very quick at doing it either way" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob Both sensible and you'll get very quick at doing it either way" class="internal-link">Rob: Both sensible, and you&#x27;ll get very quick at doing it either way</a>_</span>

> That principle is something that applies to all consciousnesses - not even just human beings; all consciousnesses. Whenever there's a consciousness, the appearance of things to that consciousness depends on the push and the pull, the relationship with. And that's universal. That universality, seeing that, understanding that, brings equanimity, as I said, but brings very deep compassion, because it's got very deep wisdom with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > The true nature of all things is immeasurable" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#The true nature of all things is immeasurable" class="internal-link">The true nature of all things is immeasurable</a>_</span>

> What if I saw everything as unsatisfactory? Just things come into consciousness, any experience, anything at all - just regard it as unsatisfactory. It's not a loathing or an aversion. Just saying, "Ah! It can't satisfy me."

> I was just being there, and the experience was getting more and more bright, more and more there, more and more present, more and more radiant. But if I keep letting go, it actually begins to fade.

> And it seems at first that there was a person _here_ and a person _there_, and the love is moving towards them. It can deepen. And it's almost like the sense of the person begins to _blur_ a bit. And there is just the sense of two hearts, and a flow, a radiation, between the two hearts. And even that can deepen. And can become, at times, a sense of a kind of communion of hearts.

> The very nature of consciousness itself is that it's always creating an object and shaping, colouring - 'fabricating' is the Buddha's word - fabricating an object.

> The problem is something _we_ bring into it through our relationship with it. In itself, any experience is empty of problem. It's so important, that level of insight. So absolutely crucial.
