> How is it that my well of joy, my reservoir of inner happiness, can be deepened in life? And so looking into: how does the being open to wonder?

> And our life involves an incredible amount of uncertainty and change. That's the nature, that's the fabric of our existence. And they, like us, are subject to that. So just holding this lightly, this sense of _anicca_ that they are vulnerable to, holding that in the awareness very lightly, as one's doing the _mettā_, can either kick-start the _mettā_ when it feels like it's a little bit blocked or it can't really get off the ground... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > a Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#a Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life" class="internal-link">a) Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life</a>_</span>
