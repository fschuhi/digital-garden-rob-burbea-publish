> [T]here are some who can't wait. They have to include and learn as they go along, through different ways of looking, different practices, trial and error (with the help, hopefully, of the teachers), but to discern between these different movements: what's _papañca_?

> "Notice the love with the imaginal figures." This is really important. Imaginal figures always involve love. Sometimes it's really not obvious at all. Sometimes it can _look_ like the opposite, but there is love there. And there are many different kinds of love, many flavours, characters, expressions of love. This is to be noticed in imaginal practice. And it's both ways. The love is both ways. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4 > Eros is already in imaginal practice because imaginal figures always involve love" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros is already in imaginal practice because imaginal figures always involve love" class="internal-link">Eros is already in imaginal practice, because imaginal figures always involve love</a>_</span>

> [E]ros, wanting more, it deepens and creates/discovers more to the image, gives more imaginal dimensions, imaginal complexity, imaginal facets and faces to this beloved other, and in that, the idea, the logos, also, of this other expands. That eros-psyche-logos, that soulmaking dynamic, then comes back, because the object then is more beautiful, more deep, more rich, more juicy, more enticing, more complex. It offers me more. It offers more for the psyche, so to speak, to move into, to expand, but also for the eros to find attractive and to want more of. So there's this way that it kind of, potentially infinitely, in a way, just expands. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4 > Eros psyche logos they all help each other" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros psyche logos they all help each other" class="internal-link">Eros, psyche, logos, they all help each other</a>_</span>

> [W]hen we talk about the _imaginal_ Middle Way, we're not talking about simply a dissolution, a melting of the self, a dissolving, a disappearing, a fading of self or other objects of the imagination. To be an object of the imagination, it must be formed in some way. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > We are free to entertain any sense of self" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#We are free to entertain any sense of self" class="internal-link">We are free to entertain any sense of self</a>_</span>

> We have all kinds of reasons and social taboos and cultural conditionings and whatnot, and contractions of being, and psychology - it's harder to have that, to recognize the beauty and the dimensionality, and to have an erotic relationship with oneself. So one kind of externalizes it by just making it image. Don't worry if it's not imaginal at first. It can very soon _become_ imaginal, more fully imaginal, with the eros there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Sometimes its easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when its externalized like that" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Sometimes it's easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it's externalized like that" class="internal-link">Sometimes it&#x27;s easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it&#x27;s externalized like that</a>_</span>
