> So this practice that we've been doing this week, with directing kindness towards things, and sometimes the things fade - one actually sees that, through the lack of kindness or the lack of acceptance, a perception is actually getting built, it's getting fabricated or compounded, to use the Buddha's words, constructed in the moment. Without the mind doing something, that perception cannot be there. So something, whatever's going on, is just a perception. It's just fabricated. It's empty, in other words. It's empty. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Practice seeing things as just perceptions" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Practice seeing things as just perceptions" class="internal-link">Practice: seeing things as just perceptions</a>_</span>

> The very nature of consciousness itself is that it's always creating an object and shaping, colouring - 'fabricating' is the Buddha's word - fabricating an object.

> This self-sense that seems so real, this object-sense that seems so real, this thing before me, this thing in my mind, this emotion, whatever it is, seems so real - it's a dependent arising.

> Not just that it is not me and it is not mine, but it is, in itself, empty. It's an illusory appearance, to borrow the Buddha's terminology. It's a fabrication. It's a concoction. It's a construction - a construction dependent on the way of looking. If I look in a certain way, the world appears, and it appears very solid. If I look in other ways, it appears, but it appears much less solid. And if I look in certain ways, certain ways of looking, if I pay attention in certain ways of looking, it does not appear. This thing that was troubling me, this thing that I loved, this thing that was neutral, fades. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Not just that is not me but it is empty" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Not just that is not me but it is empty" class="internal-link">Not just that is not me, but it is empty</a>_</span>

> Everyone seems to talk as if these things are real - bare sensations, or if I'm in a certain culture, the atomic process of mind moments and experiences. Is that the ultimate reality? Or is that just a certain level of less fabrication? So I keep this framework of ways of looking and fabrication, and I just see. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Bare sensations etc is not ultimate reality" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Bare sensations etc is not ultimate reality" class="internal-link">Bare sensations etc. is not ultimate reality</a>_</span>

> And always in Dharma inquiry, always, there's something really fundamental to see: there's a principle that how we view something - always we see that how we view something affects the perception of that 'something.' The ideas that I have, the preconceptions, the conceptions, the relationship with the 'something' that I'm investigating, the area of inquiry, affects my perception of that 'something,' and affects the related experiences that unfold, that can unfold, or that will unfold. All that's to do with dependent arising. The view, the way of looking, affects. It shapes the perception, fabrication. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > 3 Opening a direction of investigation" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#3 Opening a direction of investigation" class="internal-link">3.

> One of the immense strengths of the Buddha's teaching and Dharma teaching is that he kind of gives us a set of concepts, and in a way, they become ways of looking. That's what these concepts are; they become ways of looking. But they serve to simplify. So Dharma concepts serve to simplify, simplify because they fabricate less. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Dharma concepts aim towards less papanca" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Dharma concepts aim towards less papanca" class="internal-link">Dharma concepts aim towards less papanca</a>_</span>

> So there's a spectrum of fabrication, and different ways of looking fabricate more or less, all the way to extremely gross and solid and oppressive, to much, much less fabricated, less fabricated, less fabricated, etc., down into not fabricating at all. What's fabricated there, as I said, is _dukkha_, is dis-ease and suffering, but also the sense of self, the sense of object, the sense of world, the sense of time - all of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > 3 Fabrication" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#3 Fabrication" class="internal-link">(3) Fabrication</a>_</span>

> Without me _doing_ something, usually unconsciously, it cannot arise as that emotion. It cannot get fabricated. It cannot get constructed. So in the Buddha's words, we "see a hindrance as a hindrance,"^[Cf. the Buddha's statement at DN 22: "One dwells seeing phenomena as phenomena in terms of the five hindrances" _(dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati pañcasu nīvaraṇesu)_] and not necessarily as an emotion. We recognize what's there. It's a 'fabrication,' or in other language, it's actually 'empty.' &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Over time it becomes almost undeniable that an emotion is an fabrication" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Over time it becomes almost undeniable that an emotion is an fabrication" class="internal-link">Over time it becomes almost undeniable that an emotion is an fabrication</a>_</span>

> [T]he view of catharsis, the view of, "Yes, something is purifying here. I may not even know what, but I sit through it as a purification," and then I have a whole stance with that and relationship with it - or the view that "It's _not_ that. They're fabrications, and I need to get interested in the fabrication." They're both there. But as we practise certainly _jhānas_ more and more, we begin to "see a hindrance as a hindrance" more and more, as the Buddha might say. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > I can see an emotion as empty or see it as real Im not parking in either one" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#I can see an emotion as empty or see it as real I'm not parking in either one" class="internal-link">I can see an emotion as empty or see it as real, I&#x27;m not parking in either one</a>_</span>

> Oftentimes it's the 'making' that people don't relate to, the word 'making.' Of course, if you understand the whole track of exploration of <a data-href="ways of looking" class="internal-link">ways of looking</a> and <a data-href="fabrication" class="internal-link">fabrication</a> ('fabrication' is just another word for 'making'), and how that deepens, and how it opens out, and the understanding it opens out, then the word 'making' is almost an indispensable word in 'soulmaking.' But for a lot of people, it's very puzzling, because you'd usually think of the word 'soul,' or have a sense of soul, or use that in a very reified way: it wouldn't be something that we _make_. It would be something that _is_, or we discover, or that just is a level of being or whatever. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > A teacher said I dont really relate to the word soul" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#A teacher said I don't really relate to the word 'soul'" class="internal-link">A teacher said: &quot;I don&#x27;t really relate to the word &#x27;soul&#x27;&quot;</a>_</span>
