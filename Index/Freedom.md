> This right now, this sound, this sight, these body sensations, it's all in the context of .. the vast unknown of death.

> But there are ways of understanding anattā that go even beyond the notion of impermanence, a whole other depth. If that's accessible, then that's great; if it's not, it's fine.

> In that climate of compassion, with a little bit more broad awareness, it's like a lens of looking at the present moment, the present experience, through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering, in the moment. So we begin to see little sufferings, little ways that we're creating suffering. And organically somehow, because of the compassion practice, we can just unhook. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Looking at the present experience through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Looking at the present experience through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering" class="internal-link">Looking at the present experience, through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering</a>_</span>

> So I'm talking about modes of seeing that we can pick up and use, that lead to a sense of freedom. If they lead to a sense of agitation or confusion, existentially or all the rest of it, torment - wrong! Put it away!

> So part of what 'practise' means is playing with ways of looking, shaking things up, saying, "Let me look at this another way.

> Why did the Buddha go on and on and on and on about clinging? Clinging brings suffering. Clinging closes the heart. Releasing clinging brings freedom; it also brings love. And we can notice this so we're crystal clear about it, and there's just no arguing about it. It's very, very clear to us. We feel it in the heart and in the body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > f feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#f feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre" class="internal-link">f) feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre</a>_</span>

> At a very deep level, when we begin to undermine that belief in the independent existence of things, then our whole sense of reality is opened up. It's almost as if suffering can't land anywhere; we can't land anywhere to struggle with anything. Or we believe that less and less, put it that way. And then comes more and more a sense of freedom, and love comes. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > The whole nature of perception begins to be unravelled" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#The whole nature of perception begins to be unravelled" class="internal-link">The whole nature of perception begins to be unravelled</a>_</span>

> And there are plenty of bodhisattvas in this world, living out a life of compassion, both in the first world and the second world and the third world and - all of it. And one can seek out these people and be around them. There are a lot of remarkable beings out there. And just to let that rub off.

> The actual route to the freedom, whether it fits in the neat confines of our image of some technique or not, that's totally irrelevant. The route doesn't matter, the freedom matters. And the principle is almost always the same for the Buddha: wholesome nourishment, investigation. And of course, in a life of practice, one has different approaches at different times. Of course one does. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > The route doesnt matter the freedom matters" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#The route doesn't matter the freedom matters" class="internal-link">The route doesn&#x27;t matter, the freedom matters</a>_</span>

> And these become very charged concepts: 'what is,' 'things as they are.' But again, that's never, never, never the goal of the path. It's a beautiful way of practising. It's a beautiful way of being - _cannot_ be the goal of the path. The goal of the path is an understanding, a very deep understanding, that brings freedom with it. It brings freedom. It's something gone beyond this 'what is' and these notions. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > In mindfulness practice the assumption is often that mindfulness is neutral - things as they are" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#In mindfulness practice the assumption is often that mindfulness is neutral - things as they are" class="internal-link">In mindfulness practice, the assumption is often that mindfulness is neutral - &quot;things as they are&quot;</a>_</span>
