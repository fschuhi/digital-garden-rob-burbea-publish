> [W]hen we talk about the _imaginal_ Middle Way, we're not talking about simply a dissolution, a melting of the self, a dissolving, a disappearing, a fading of self or other objects of the imagination. To be an object of the imagination, it must be formed in some way. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > We are free to entertain any sense of self" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#We are free to entertain any sense of self" class="internal-link">We are free to entertain any sense of self</a>_</span>

> [W]e're dancing on the breadth of this boulevard of the imaginal Middle Way with respect to reification, how much, how little at different times.
