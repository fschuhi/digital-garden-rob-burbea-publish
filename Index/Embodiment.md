> Now, okay, so here's a certain personality, a certain kind of style of expression. Certainly it's not to imply that the only way to stand firm is in a quiet and serene way. I don't want to imply that at all. But if this is the kind of iconic moment we're drawing on or we're focusing on for this part of this exercise, then that's actually part of the <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, that it is quiet and serene. So maybe you can get a sense of that, of what would it be to sense into that whole, the whole <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Gestalt Psychology" data-href="Gestalt Psychology" class="internal-link">gestalt</a>, the whole configuration of that whole moment, that whole image, that whole time, that icon, that iconic moment, and then see how that wants to be mirrored or refracted or expressed with the body [[Embodiment|movement, gesture, voice]], or what wants to manifest or express in response to that or from that as a seed. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Embodying reflecting refracting" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Embodying reflecting refracting" class="internal-link">Embodying, reflecting, refracting</a>_</span>

> This is what we want. We want the body and the <a data-href="soul" class="internal-link">soul</a> integrated together. We want the possibility of soul to manifest, express, flow through and flow from all aspects of the being, including the [[Embodiment|body movement]], the body sense, the gesturing, the voice, the language, all of it. We want soul to be able to come through there as soul wants to come through there, so that we _can_ follow our <a data-href="telos" class="internal-link">telos</a>, we _can_ discharge our <a data-href="duty" class="internal-link">duty</a>, we _can_ carry that out, we _can_ have a fuller sense of ourselves, sense ourselves with soul, sense our life with soul, our work, our duty, our relationships, our being, the aspects of our being.

> Can we exercise and open up the channels of our being, the movements we make, the body, the [[Embodiment|sense of the body]], the sense of the emotions, the gestures, the voice, so that, at times, at least, we, too, are dwelling, vijahāra, in the diamond, the indestructible, the eternal heart essence of the body, speech, and mind of all Buddhas, all Tathāgatas, all those who go to and come from this transcendent truth, this transcendent reality, this reality that is both transcendent and immanent?... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4 > Open up so that we too are dwelling there" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Open up so that we too are dwelling there" class="internal-link">Open up so that we, too, are dwelling there</a>_</span>
