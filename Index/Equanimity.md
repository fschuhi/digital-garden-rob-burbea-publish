> So [[equanimity]], it's a word that the [[Buddha]] used a lot, it's very common and it's in all those dreadful Buddhist lists of things, it appears quite a lot. But in our common everyday usage it's actually not very common. So it's not very typical that you're walking down the street and you meet your friend and you ask, "How are you doing?" and he says/she says, "I'm very equanimous today." And even for people who've been practising for a while, we may [[wonder]], What does it mean? What does this word mean, _equanimity_? Have I ever even had any? And we may have been practising for a while and have a vague sense what it means, and also quite some ambivalence in our relationship towards it. It's not a particularly sexy sounding word. _([[1228 Equanimity (talk)#1-2|1-2]])_

> So the [[Buddha]] uses it in a couple of different ways and what I want to focus on tonight is the most common way that he used it. Which is to really mean something like a [[steadiness]], a steadiness of the mind, of the heart, in the face of, in relationship to, _all_ conditions, inner and outer, _all_ experiences. There's a kind of stability, a kind of unshakeability to the mind, to the heart. (...) So ... what is _not_ [[equanimity]]: something happens in our [[experience]] and it completely grips us and we basically keel over inwardly or even outwardly, we keel over. _([[1228 Equanimity (talk)#1-3|1-3]])_

> So when the [[Buddha]] was talking about this [[equanimity]], he said, "equanimity in relation to what?" Yeah, everything, all experiences - but in particular to what he called the '[[eight worldly conditions]]'. (...) life presents us with these opposites, it's inevitable. How much do we wobble when there's that movement between praise and blame and the rest of it? How much do we wobble inside? How much do we keel over? How much is our state of mind dependent on where things stand with those polarities? Just to reflect on that, how central just those four pairs are to our sense of well-being and okayness. _([[1228 Equanimity (talk)#2-1|2-1]])_

> [W]hen we hear about this [[equanimity]], part of the reason that it's almost like a bit unattractive to us is that it can sound a bit like a sort of disconnection or not caring. So there's something called the '[[near enemy]]' of equanimity which is a quality that ... looks like equanimity but it's actually not. The near enemy is indifference. (...) The difference is that with equanimity the heart is still open, the heart is still open, it's not a state of disconnection. We're not shut down, we're not cold, removed. Equanimity is not a dull state or a kind of greyness, everything's just grey, the colours have gone out of life. _([[1228 Equanimity (talk)#2-2|2-2]])_

> Sometimes also the reason we are not so attracted to the idea of [[equanimity]] is that we have come to feel and believe that our sense of some juice in life, of juiciness, is wrapped up in drama - in the drama of [[the self]], the drama of getting or getting rid of, of some difficulty or this or that - and when that drama dies down a bit, we're a little bit unsure if what will remain will be a bit grey or a bit boring. It's hard to imagine that maybe equanimity, true equanimity, actually has a quality of juiciness in it. _([[1228 Equanimity (talk)#2-2|2-2]])_

> [[Spaciousness]] and [[equanimity]] really go together. So equanimity basically is a state of mind, it's a state of mind, a state of [[steadiness]] of mind and heart, a state of spaciousness. _([[1228 Equanimity (talk)#2-3|2-3]])_

> [O]ur state of mind is not either random or solely event-based. ... we can actually [[Cultivation|cultivate]] this quality of [[equanimity]]. We can really nourish it, nurture it. ... at least one half of [[Dharma|the path]] is very active in terms of cultivating these kind of qualities, these states of mind, these qualities like equanimity, very much active. And the other part, we could say, is just about letting things be, quite a passive sense of just presence, just allowing. _([[1228 Equanimity (talk)#2-4|2-4]])_

> So, you know, if we're at home or even here and we get up in the morning and say, "I don't know, I'm kind of tired today, maybe I won't sit." Or, "Actually I feel fantastic, I don't need to sit today." Or, "I'm a little sad and I don't really, you know.." Or whatever it is. Just the actual act of showing up, "I'm going to sit every day, I'm going to practise every day." _Just that_ is a statement of [[steadiness]]. Somehow these small steps of steadiness they sort of percolate down in the being and that quality of [[equanimity]] becomes.. the bedrock of the being. _([[1228 Equanimity (talk)#4-2|4-2]])_

> So probably a less common way that's talked about, way that [[equanimity]] gets built, gets nourished, gets cultivated, is actually related to the whole quality of [[happiness]]. So if we reflect a little I think we can see that we are so wobbly with all these things, with all these conditions, often because we don't yet have a reservoir of happiness inside that's not dependent on outer conditions. (...) as we develop that, our equanimity becomes more unshakable, we become less wobbly. _([[1228 Equanimity (talk)#5-3|5-3]])_

> So [[Metta|kindness]], [[compassion]], service, this movement outwards.. for some people this can be quite significant in the [[cultivation]] of [[equanimity]] (...) So we heal ourselves as much by giving [[attention]] to ourselves and what's difficult in ourselves, as much as by developing what is lovely, as much as putting the attention outwards in a beautiful way and caring for others. _([[1228 Equanimity (talk)#6-3|6-3]])_

> So, just the basic practice of showing up on the cushion, for the [[Meditation|walking meditation]], the [[Steadiness|calmness]], the [[Samadhi|collectedness]], itself that brings a steadiness; the contemplation of [[impermanence]]; the building of the [[happiness]] inside, the [[metta]], [[compassion]], [[mudita]], spiritual joy, building this happiness - all this feeds [[equanimity]]._ ([[1228 Equanimity (talk)#9-3|9-3]])_

> So there's a Tibetan teacher and someone asked him, "What's [[equanimity]]?" and he said, "Equanimity is being equally near all things." Which is a very beautiful way of putting it, 'being equally near all things'. (...) No pressure on self to be more, better, different, less. No pressure on the world, no pressure on things - inner, outer. No pressure. (...) _But,_ to be equally near all things means that I'm not [[Aversion|pushing away]] what I don't like - what's difficult and unpleasant - and I'm not pulling towards me what's pleasant. [[Craving|The push and the pull]] ... have died down through [[mindfulness]] or deliberately letting them die down. _([[1228 Equanimity (talk)#11-3|11-3]])_

> When there's no [[Craving|push-pull]], when the push-pull has become very quiet. No objects, no problem. No objects, no problem. In a way that's a whole other perhaps level of meaning because we usually take [[equanimity]] to mean when something difficult or fantastic is going on then we're steady with it. But as it goes really into the depth, ... it takes on a whole different meaning, there's _nothing happening_, there's nothing really to be equanimous _about_... Deep equanimity has a real [[beauty]] in it, has a real beauty in it. (...) This level of equanimity really has a profound beauty in it. Something that really touches the being very deeply. It's also deeply [[Cultivation|nourishing]], deeply nourishing. _([[1228 Equanimity (talk)#12-2|12-2]])_

> We begin to understand, what we could say, the _[[immeasurability]]_ of all things; the immeasurability of all things. How a thing is, how strong it is, how intense it is, how much of a big deal it is, how it is, depends on [[Craving|the push and the pull]], how much of a push and a pull there is. In itself it's nothing, it's not any way. So the only way a thing really is is immeasurable. All things, so-called 'inner', so-called 'outer'. We begin to know this. And the knowing moves from a sort of intellectual level down into the heart, into the body, into the cells. And, in a way, that's the most, the deepest kind of [[Cultivation|nourishment]] of [[equanimity]]. Because then ... we don't believe so much in the inherent power of things or the inherent 'way things are'. We don't believe so much in the necessity of them making us wobble, making us keel over. We taste something about the immeasurability of things and there's a real [[freedom]] in that. _([[1228 Equanimity (talk)#12-5|12-5]])_

> I can not remember his word for it, but the [[pain]] of the contemplative, I think he called it in a [[sutta]] somewhere in the [[Pali Canon|Pāli Canon]] about [[equanimity]]. He does not say, in regard to the meditator, the contemplative, who hears about other people [[awakening]], who wants awakening but is not there yet, he does not say, "Just relax. Let go. Do not [[desire]]. Drop it. Too much [[passion]]." He does not say that. He said, "Yeah, that is how it is until you realize. What you need to do is keep going until you realize, and then your passion will be quenched." So it is oftentimes quite a different message that we are getting, or interpretation that we are putting on the teachings. _([[0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#3-5|3-5]])_

> As the practice of [[compassion]] deepens - so we're working with this balance, and we're [[healing]], we're sensitive to [[Dukkha|suffering]], and we're radiating out the healing - as it deepens, sometimes there's a possibility it deepens to, in a way, a third aspect. Not just the empathizing and the giving out, but a third aspect of what I would call '[[spaciousness]],' or '[[equanimity]]' comes in, or a kind of 'holding' comes in. Sometimes it can be there really is a sense of space [that] opens up in the practice of compassion. And it's almost as if that space - the space of compassion, or could call it the space of [[awareness]], or just the space of the universe, whatever you want to call it - somehow feels like it effortlessly and organically holds whatever suffering arises. _([[0201 The Practice of Compassion#8-4|8-4]])_

> [T]o be in the world with [[compassion]], acting out of compassion is the best way to live. There's just no doubt about it. And we don't know what will happen. This is where the [[equanimity]] comes in - we actually are not completely in control of what will happen. Again, it's an [[Dependent Origination|infinite web of conditions]]. It's not just in our control. Somehow, as compassion deepens, the equanimity comes more and more into the practice. _([[0201 The Practice of Compassion#16-7|16-7]])_

> So we say, "All right, maybe not [[mindfulness]]. What about that other word, '[[equanimity]]'? I've heard about that one. That must be the thing that's right there in the middle, at the perfect point. It even sounds like it, _equa_-, equa-something." But again, a deep practice of equanimity, notice the same thing: the [[perception]] of the object begins to change. It changes with the degree of equanimity. And there's a similar kind of [[Emptiness|fading]] with equanimity. Things make less impression on [[consciousness]] when there's a lot of [[love]] or a lot of equanimity. So we can definitely see this on the cushion and with this practice that we're doing now. You can see it with [[Embodiment|body sensations]], with painful body sensations, with [[emotions]], with whatever, absolutely. See it on the cushion in a very clear way. Can also see it off the cushion. This applies to our life too. Some situations where they're so pressing or we just can't stop thinking about them, when there's a lot of equanimity, a lot of [[Metta|mettā]], I barely register, barely register the situation, or the importance of it anyway. _([[0204 Love and Emptiness#6-1|6-1]])_
