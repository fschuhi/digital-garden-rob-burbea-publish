> What if I saw everything as unsatisfactory? Just things come into consciousness, any experience, anything at all - just regard it as unsatisfactory. It's not a loathing or an aversion. Just saying, "Ah! It can't satisfy me." What happens is there's a letting go. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Seeing things as unsatisfactory" data-href="What is Insight#Seeing things as unsatisfactory" class="internal-link">Seeing things as unsatisfactory</a>_</span>

> It's "not me, not mine." And in that, there's a letting go, a very beautiful letting go. It's not at all about disconnection, dissociation, or numbing out, or anything like that. It's practicing a mode of seeing, a certain lens. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Seeing things as not-self" data-href="What is Insight#Seeing things as not-self" class="internal-link">Seeing things as not-self</a>_</span>

> I was just being there, and the experience was getting more and more bright, more and more there, more and more present, more and more radiant. But if I keep letting go, it actually begins to fade. Experience itself begins to blur and dissolve and fade and become less prominent in consciousness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > When you dont stop there experience begins to fade" data-href="What is Insight#When you don't stop there experience begins to fade" class="internal-link">When you don&#x27;t stop there, experience begins to fade</a>_</span>

> I think it's really the whole range of that. But certainly the allowing the spaciousness, the letting go, is very significant. You can be letting go of a lot of aversion in that. Aversion has a lot to do with tiredness. When there's aversion around, it's just very tiring. So letting go, being spacious, actually allows that to just let go. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice > Be willing to experiment with the whole range of it" data-href="The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Be willing to experiment with the whole range of it" class="internal-link">Be willing to experiment with the whole range of it</a>_</span>

> Difficult things are held in place, basically, by aversion, by grasping, by identification, by all these things we're talking about letting go of. So as you let go of them, they tend to fade. Happiness, at one level, or peace, or joy, is also held in place by grasping, to an extent. But it's a more subtle kind of grasping. What one finds is that if one lets go of the grasping towards happiness, the happiness actually deepens. It becomes more refined. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > When we let go were actually taking away some of what is building an experience and it begins to fade" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#When we let go we're actually taking away some of what is building an experience and it begins to fade" class="internal-link">When we let go, we&#x27;re actually taking away some of what is building an experience, and it begins to fade</a>_</span>
