> [T]here are some who can't wait. They have to include and learn as they go along, through different ways of looking, different practices, trial and error (with the help, hopefully, of the teachers), but to discern between these different movements: what's _papañca_? What's imaginal practice? It's possible. It's absolutely possible. But in a way, parallel tracks are running concurrently. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > There are some who cannot wait" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#There are some who cannot wait" class="internal-link">There are some who cannot wait</a>_</span>

> So over time, there's this kind of sifting away, filtering away of the more _papañcizing_ element of the mind. And it becomes: "It's just the hindrance." It might still be quite strong; I'm really quite restless in the body, but there's no story attached to it. There's no lostness. What was usually _papañca_ becomes more just, "I'm just dealing with a hindrance now." &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Over time self-view manifest less as papanca and more as pure hindrance" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Over time self-view manifest less as papanca and more as pure hindrance" class="internal-link">Over time, self-view manifest less as papanca and more as pure hindrance</a>_</span>
