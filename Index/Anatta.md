#IndexEntry #Buddhology

Buddhists affirm that there is thinking and other mental events, but no thinker: if we think of the “person” as a string of beads, there is a succession of beads (momentary mental events) but no string.

What we conceptually separate as “entities” are only eddies in a constantly flowing and integrated field of events. That is, the world of multiple “real” (independent, self-contained) entities is an illusion but not what is really there—the eddies in the flow of events are not unreal but are simply not isolated entities, unconnected to the rest of the flow. The alleged discrete entities are the “discriminations” that Buddhists deny are real.

Nathan 02.09.21: It's not necessary that anatta is true. It is a lens which skillfully applied helps to a seeing that frees. (was question from Sadge: how could consciousness _not_ be myself?) => see [[Anattā.pdf]]

I form a thingness around a "thing".

Usefulness is defined in relation to dukkha (i.e. the release of it, freedom). Useful in relation to the path, to the goal.
"true/untrue" not useful
dukkha = absence of freedom
