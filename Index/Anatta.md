#IndexEntry #Buddhology

Buddhists affirm that there is thinking and other mental events, but no thinker: if we think of the “person” as a string of beads, there is a succession of beads (momentary mental events) but no string.

What we conceptually separate as “entities” are only eddies in a constantly flowing and integrated field of events. That is, the world of multiple “real” (independent, self-contained) entities is an illusion but not what is really there—the eddies in the flow of events are not unreal but are simply not isolated entities, unconnected to the rest of the flow. The alleged discrete entities are the “discriminations” that Buddhists deny are real.

Nathan 02.09.21: It's not necessary that anatta is true. It is a lens which skillfully applied helps to a seeing that frees. (was question from Sadge: how could consciousness _not_ be myself?) => see <a data-href="Anattā.pdf" class="internal-link">Anattā.pdf</a>

I form a thingness around a "thing".

Usefulness is defined in relation to dukkha (i.e. the release of it, freedom). Useful in relation to the path, to the goal.
"true/untrue" not useful
dukkha = absence of freedom

> But there are ways of understanding anattā that go even beyond the notion of impermanence, a whole other depth. If that's accessible, then that's great; if it's not, it's fine.

> [W]hen I say, "If I'm loving myself, what am I?", one level of looking at it in terms of anattā is, I am just these experiences and my relationship with them.

> What certain situations need is very relative, conventional language. We need to talk about our emotions; we need to express what we feel to each other; we need to respect that. I need to respect my emotions and your emotions at that level. So in that moment, that's what's helpful, that way of looking. But I'm saying a mature practice is able to move between picking that up, putting it down, picking up other ways of seeing - emptiness, _anattā_, etc. - and putting them down, not getting stuck in one or the other. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Maturity in practice comes from being able to move between different ways of seeing" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Maturity in practice comes from being able to move between different ways of seeing" class="internal-link">Maturity in practice comes from being able to move between different ways of seeing</a>_</span>
