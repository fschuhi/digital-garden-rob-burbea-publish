> So it's just whatever's in consciousness, whatever's prominent, there the mettā goes. And also quite quick to see what the relationship with things is. With practice, it just becomes very evident: there's some slight aversion here. And it's clear, and then the mettā comes in or the compassion or whatever. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > Rob Both sensible and youll get very quick at doing it either way" data-href="Love and Emptiness#Rob Both sensible and you'll get very quick at doing it either way" class="internal-link">Rob: Both sensible, and you&#x27;ll get very quick at doing it either way</a>_</span>

> But sometimes it can be just the sense of contraction is a sense of suffering. And one notices that when there's pushing or pulling or aversion, there's suffering there. As I relax that, the suffering goes. And being actually sensitive to the suffering and the release of suffering is really key in the deepening of equanimity. So there's a real sensitivity to suffering and its release, and suffering and its release, and suffering and its release, as the process deepens... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Rob feeling the suffering is important because theres a lot insight in this approach" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Rob feeling the suffering is important because there's a lot insight in this approach" class="internal-link">Rob: feeling the suffering is important because there&#x27;s a lot insight in this approach</a>_</span>

> What if I saw everything as unsatisfactory? Just things come into consciousness, any experience, anything at all - just regard it as unsatisfactory. It's not a loathing or an aversion. Just saying, "Ah! It can't satisfy me." What happens is there's a letting go. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Seeing things as unsatisfactory" data-href="What is Insight#Seeing things as unsatisfactory" class="internal-link">Seeing things as unsatisfactory</a>_</span>

> I think it's really the whole range of that. But certainly the allowing the spaciousness, the letting go, is very significant. You can be letting go of a lot of aversion in that. Aversion has a lot to do with tiredness. When there's aversion around, it's just very tiring. So letting go, being spacious, actually allows that to just let go. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice > Be willing to experiment with the whole range of it" data-href="The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Be willing to experiment with the whole range of it" class="internal-link">Be willing to experiment with the whole range of it</a>_</span>

> So there's the body, the thoughts, and the texture, the climate of the mind, and correspondingly, the aversion to that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Inner texture of the mind shrinks when theres fear around" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Inner texture of the mind shrinks when there's fear around" class="internal-link">Inner texture of the mind shrinks when there&#x27;s fear around</a>_</span>

> By 'clinging,' I mean pushing away what we don't like, over-identifying with things, trying to hold on to things, to grasp at things - all that is clinging. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > We can develop our capacity to become sensitive to when theres clinging around" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We can develop our capacity to become sensitive to when there's clinging around" class="internal-link">We can develop our capacity to become sensitive to when there&#x27;s clinging around</a>_</span>

> Difficult things are held in place, basically, by aversion, by grasping, by identification, by all these things we're talking about letting go of. So as you let go of them, they tend to fade. Happiness, at one level, or peace, or joy, is also held in place by grasping, to an extent. But it's a more subtle kind of grasping. What one finds is that if one lets go of the grasping towards happiness, the happiness actually deepens. It becomes more refined. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > When we let go were actually taking away some of what is building an experience and it begins to fade" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#When we let go we're actually taking away some of what is building an experience and it begins to fade" class="internal-link">When we let go, we&#x27;re actually taking away some of what is building an experience, and it begins to fade</a>_</span>

> We can actually learn to relax the grasping and see the suffering go out. It doesn't feed suffering. Equanimity and love, in their depths, are non-grasping - there isn't a pushing away or a pulling towards. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > In its depth the nature of love is non-grasping" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#In its depth the nature of love is non-grasping" class="internal-link">In its depth, the nature of love is non-grasping</a>_</span>

> [T]he more welcoming there is, basically the less aversion, the less pushing away and pulling towards (we say "less pushing and pulling"; that's less grasping), and what we notice is that the world, the world of experience, appears less. And if there's really very little grasping, it can be that very little appears at all. It just kind of dissolves, dissolves, dissolves. So it's really to see that. And to conclude from that, there's something about grasping that's actually building experience. I don't know that one can explain it any more than that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > The less grasping the less appears at all" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#The less grasping the less appears at all" class="internal-link">The less grasping, the less appears at all</a>_</span>

> [C]raving, grasping, aversion, it tends to solidify the perception of that object that we're clinging to. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4 > Clinging leads to a solidification and stagnation of perception and vice versa" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Clinging leads to a solidification and stagnation of perception and vice versa" class="internal-link">Clinging leads to a solidification and stagnation of perception, and vice versa</a>_</span>

> But what that means is that eros, in its capacity to open perception and see also image as image, is very different than grasping, aversion, clinging, craving. It has the opposite effect. It doesn't solidify. It doesn't stagnate. Actually, it _liberates_ the object. Its effect is to liberate the perception, in a certain sense. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4 > Soulmaking is thus the opposite of stagnating or solidifying the perception it liberates it" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Soulmaking is thus the opposite of stagnating or solidifying the perception it liberates it" class="internal-link">Soulmaking is thus the opposite of stagnating or solidifying the perception, it liberates it</a>_</span>

<span class="counts"><a data-href="2019 Practising the Jhanas" class="internal-link">2019 Practising the Jhanas</a></span>
> When restlessness comes up, we have aversion to the restlessness. It's unpleasant, the very sense of restlessness. And that aversion to the restlessness feeds the whole thing. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > The relationship to restlessness can feed or quieten it" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#The relationship to restlessness can feed or quieten it" class="internal-link">The relationship to restlessness can feed or quieten it</a>_</span>

> I say, well, just try. Sometimes I say, "Okay, just turn down the aversion." You say, "What do you mean, 'turn down'? I don't know how to do it." Just try. Just try to turn down the aversion, because turning down the aversion can then just directly give rise to happiness, give rise to _sukha_. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > iii Turn down any aversion in the mind which helps sukha to arise" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#iii Turn down any aversion in the mind which helps sukha to arise" class="internal-link">(iii) Turn down any aversion in the mind, which helps sukha to arise</a>_</span>

> Instead of the automatic, natural aversion to the hindrances, I'm actually saying, "Come, come, I'll take this." But it has heart in it. It has this, "I'm willing to take this suffering right now. I'm opening myself to the suffering for the sake of the release from suffering of someone else, somewhere." So it's a kind of, you could say, 'magical thinking' - it doesn't matter - using your imagination, whatever. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Exchanging happiness of self and other" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Exchanging happiness of self and other" class="internal-link">Exchanging happiness of self and other</a>_</span>

> [T]here's something in the way I'm seeing this and relating to this actually really lovely thing, and I'm somehow spinning it with a negative - I'm seeing it through a negative lens. This is incredibly common, and it's what we might call, like, a really deep, deep, almost base-level _kilesa,_ defilement, of aversion in the mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Cup half-full half-empty on a really subtle level seeing through a negative lens" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Cup half-full half-empty on a really subtle level seeing through a negative lens" class="internal-link">Cup half-full, half-empty on a really subtle level, seeing through a negative lens</a>_</span>
