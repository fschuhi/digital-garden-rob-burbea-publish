> [E]ros, wanting more, it deepens and creates/discovers more to the image, gives more imaginal dimensions, imaginal complexity, imaginal facets and faces to this beloved other, and in that, the idea, the logos, also, of this other expands.

> We have all kinds of reasons and social taboos and cultural conditionings and whatnot, and contractions of being, and psychology - it's harder to have that, to recognize the beauty and the dimensionality, and to have an erotic relationship with oneself. So one kind of externalizes it by just making it image. Don't worry if it's not imaginal at first. It can very soon _become_ imaginal, more fully imaginal, with the eros there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Sometimes its easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when its externalized like that" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Sometimes it's easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it's externalized like that" class="internal-link">Sometimes it&#x27;s easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it&#x27;s externalized like that</a>_</span>

> Sometimes you get an image which is not so much a narrative image as much as it has a kind of backstory. It has a kind of imaginal background.

> The self needs to become image. It wants to become image. Soul wants to make things imaginal, to discover their imaginal dimensions. And it needs to imprint. It wants to express itself.
