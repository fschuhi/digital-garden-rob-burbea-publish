> So this practice that we've been doing this week, with directing kindness towards things, and sometimes the things fade - one actually sees that, through the lack of kindness or the lack of acceptance, a perception is actually getting built, it's getting fabricated or compounded, to use the Buddha's words, constructed in the moment. Without the mind doing something, that perception cannot be there. So something, whatever's going on, is just a perception. It's just fabricated. It's empty, in other words. It's empty. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Practice seeing things as just perceptions" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Practice seeing things as just perceptions" class="internal-link">Practice: seeing things as just perceptions</a>_</span>

> So we typically look in ways that actually lead to clinging, lead to suffering. That's what we do all the time. The Buddha said, "Can you learn to look in different ways that bring release?" Release of the clinging brings release from suffering, and that brings love. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Alternative practice ways of looking that bring release" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Alternative practice ways of looking that bring release" class="internal-link">Alternative: practice ways of looking that bring release</a>_</span>

> [L]ove and fear have this kind of inverse relationship. Originally, the Buddha offered the _mettā_ practice to a group of monks who were really, really afraid in the forest. That was his initial offering as an antidote and as a response to fear. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Fear is an aversion that blocks love" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Fear is an aversion that blocks love" class="internal-link">Fear is an aversion that blocks love</a>_</span>

> Why did the Buddha go on and on and on and on about clinging? Clinging brings suffering. Clinging closes the heart. Releasing clinging brings freedom; it also brings love. And we can notice this so we're crystal clear about it, and there's just no arguing about it. It's very, very clear to us. We feel it in the heart and in the body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > f feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#f feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre" class="internal-link">f) feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre</a>_</span>

> The very nature of consciousness itself is that it's always creating an object and shaping, colouring - 'fabricating' is the Buddha's word - fabricating an object. As such, there is no place to stand where you see a thing as it is _independently of the way I'm looking at it_. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > There is no moment of consciousness that is not shaping or creating or colouring or fabricating an experience" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#There is no moment of consciousness that is not shaping or creating or colouring or fabricating an experience" class="internal-link">There is no moment of consciousness that is not shaping or creating or colouring or fabricating an experience</a>_</span>

> So when the Buddha uses the words "things as they are," what he means, what he meant, was "things as they are" - it's _dependent_, dependent co-arising.

> Not just that it is not me and it is not mine, but it is, in itself, empty. It's an illusory appearance, to borrow the Buddha's terminology. It's a fabrication. It's a concoction. It's a construction - a construction dependent on the way of looking. If I look in a certain way, the world appears, and it appears very solid. If I look in other ways, it appears, but it appears much less solid. And if I look in certain ways, certain ways of looking, if I pay attention in certain ways of looking, it does not appear.
