> Mind always has some mind state. So with [mindfulness](app://obsidian.md/mindfulness), there's always _some_ degree of something on the range from complete unconditioned bliss of loving-kindness to rage. The mind will be somewhere along that spectrum. It _has_ to be. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > But the mind is coloroud with anger metta romantic love" data-href="Love and Emptiness#But the mind is coloroud with anger metta romantic love" class="internal-link">But the mind is coloroud with anger, metta, romantic love</a>_</span>

> Put that on as a lens, a way of seeing, as a practice. So this is moving beyond what we might call "simple mindfulness" or "simple presence or being," and actually deliberately taking up a certain mode of seeing, a certain way of looking at experience, for a period of time... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Another way to consolidate the insight is to use it as a mode of seeing" data-href="What is Insight#Another way to consolidate the insight is to use it as a mode of seeing" class="internal-link">Another way to consolidate the insight is to use it as a mode of seeing</a>_</span>

> Something very beautiful, very precious, and extremely important about just giving attention, just coming back, just being here, just being mindful, devoting oneself to that - a preciousness and beauty in that way of being, way of practicing, and trusting that out of that, the insights will come. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Impermanence is an obvious fact but are we seeing it in a way that makes a difference" data-href="What is Insight#Impermanence is an obvious fact but are we seeing it in a way that makes a difference" class="internal-link">Impermanence is an obvious fact, but are we seeing it in a way that makes a difference?</a>_</span>

> Mindfulness, when there's mindfulness, attentiveness, presence, with curiosity and the curiosity of investigation, that can be there, and a kind of energy with that, that we're injecting some energy into that.

> What's almost always lacking with fear is confidence. We don't feel confident that we can actually be with the fear and accommodate it, and be okay with it. With practice, bringing mindfulness to all of it, we just see: it's just that, and it's accommodatable.

> Everyone seems to talk as if these things are real - bare sensations, or if I'm in a certain culture, the atomic process of mind moments and experiences. Is that the ultimate reality?

> The doors were presented one after another. The consequences, the avenues, were travelled in a kind of logical or inevitable order - one insight, one opening led to another, etc., all based on what we might call the 'phenomenological approach,' which is how I would base my approach to the Dharma.

> They're little seeds. And then without wisdom and mindfulness, those seeds become huge, huge trees, forests, jungles - jungles, better.
