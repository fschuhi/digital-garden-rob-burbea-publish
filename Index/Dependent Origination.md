> But mostly it's actually just a little drop, and then one goes out into that infinite web of conditions in the life. Maybe it's just a seed. It meets another condition, then it begins to sprout. Maybe it sprouts a little here, and then it gets watered. Maybe it meets the wrong conditions and it just gets covered over, you know? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > Maybe its just a seed" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#Maybe it's just a seed" class="internal-link">Maybe it&#x27;s just a seed</a>_</span>

> "I won't put the pole here; I'll keep going, keep the questioning alive," until one has totally understood this dependent arising and how anything at all - no matter how beautiful, how subtle, how refined, how seemingly ultimate - comes to be. And that doesn't mean dismissing everything as just conditions, and it's just all irrelevant. It doesn't mean that at all, because one also opens to the Unconditioned and the beauty of what that means as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and the Emptiness of Things > To understand fully the nature of perception is to be fully awakened" data-href="Love and the Emptiness of Things#To understand fully the nature of perception is to be fully awakened" class="internal-link">To understand fully the nature of perception is to be fully awakened</a>_</span>

> To realize the actual limits of one's actions and just to see: we are limited. Or even in other contexts, you have to see that here, one may be giving service or acting compassionately or trying to alleviate the suffering, and it's only one strand in a web of conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Compassion needs wisdom and faith in it" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Compassion needs wisdom and faith in it" class="internal-link">Compassion needs wisdom and faith in it</a>_</span>

> That's what wisdom or insight or _paññā_ means: we're understanding the causes and conditions that lead to suffering. And out of that very understanding is born compassion. That very understanding will bring with it compassion. So one could never go anywhere near loving-kindness practice or compassion practice, and just the deepening of the insight will bring compassion naturally, effortlessly, organically, because we're going into the causes and conditions and _understanding_ that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Compassion is borne out of the understanding of the causes and conditions of suffering" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Compassion is borne out of the understanding of the causes and conditions of suffering" class="internal-link">Compassion is borne out of the understanding of the causes and conditions of suffering</a>_</span>

> Axiomatic: there's nothing beyond this. What do you mean by _this_? What do you mean? Poke, question. What do you mean by _this_? Do you mean matter? Or do you mean appearances? Big difference in what is meant. If you mean matter, what is it that you mean by matter? {quote If you mean appearances, there's nothing beyond appearances, again, what exactly do you mean?

> This self-sense that seems so real, this object-sense that seems so real, this thing before me, this thing in my mind, this emotion, whatever it is, seems so real - it's a dependent arising.

> [N]either that chocolate cake investigation or the tea investigation, nor the deep investigation into dependent arising and emptiness that I explained, will be enough for understanding and opening out and giving nourishment and life, and structure and vision, and opening doors in the realm, in the direction, of the soul-passions or the subtle movements of eros. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > Nourishment life structure vision opening doors" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Nourishment life structure vision opening doors" class="internal-link">Nourishment, life, structure, vision, opening doors</a>_</span>

> And always in Dharma inquiry, always, there's something really fundamental to see: there's a principle that how we view something - always we see that how we view something affects the perception of that 'something.' The ideas that I have, the preconceptions, the conceptions, the relationship with the 'something' that I'm investigating, the area of inquiry, affects my perception of that 'something,' and affects the related experiences that unfold, that can unfold, or that will unfold.
