> We get stuck in certain [[Active listening|modes of listening]], certain modes of reading. And it takes a bit of work to push ourself out of that particular kind of groove or rut, basically, that we're in. [[Inertia]] in physics takes work to overcome. It takes force to overcome. _(<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1" data-href="0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#5-4" href="0301+Preliminaries+Regarding+Voice%2C+Movement%2C+and+Gesture+-+Part+1#5-4" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5-4</a>)_

> Again, there can be an <a data-href="inertia" href="inertia" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inertia</a> regarding what we hear, and what we read, and without even realizing it, we actually end up hearing and end up reading what we already think we know. I'm actually just chopping off, shaving off, just literally not hearing or seeing what doesn't actually fit into what I think I already know, and so I end up just reading something that's, in fact, quite different, or quite challenging to what I already know, but I think I've just read something that's completely confirmed it, or just has said what I already know in different words. _(<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1" data-href="0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#6-1" href="0301+Preliminaries+Regarding+Voice%2C+Movement%2C+and+Gesture+-+Part+1#6-1" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6-1</a>)_

> Even just now, up to now, we've thrown out this idea about <a data-href="inertia" href="inertia" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inertia</a>, and this question. It's like, actually taking on this question, this inquiry: where's the inertia for me in relation to [[Meditation|Dharma practice]], how and what I practise, in relationship to how and what I study or hear, or how I listen? Where's the inertia? And how does that inertia balance with a need for <a data-href="steadiness" href="steadiness" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steadiness</a>? I actually need to stay with something for a while. Then I can get too entrenched in something. So all this inquiry into inertia. Now, I would say that that inquiry into inertia, even though we're not really going into it at the moment [laughs] - again, I'm postponing it, or just mentioning it; I don't know if I'll ever get back to it - I would actually say that's _more_ important as a teaching, as an inquiry, structurally it's more important, at the meta-level it's more important than anything else that I might say in this set of talks about movement and gesture or anything else. _(<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1" data-href="0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#7-3" href="0301+Preliminaries+Regarding+Voice%2C+Movement%2C+and+Gesture+-+Part+1#7-3" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7-3</a>)_

> As usual, a little bit of [[Middle Way]] can go a long way, bringing some intelligence here, knowing one's patterns, recognizing the kinds of <a data-href="inertia" href="inertia" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inertia</a> one typically gets entrenched in, falls into. All that's really important. As usual, it's really about [[Insight|discernment]], intelligence, and applying that to one's practice. _(<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="0302 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2" data-href="0302 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#6-4" href="0302+Preliminaries+Regarding+Voice%2C+Movement%2C+and+Gesture+-+Part+2#6-4" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6-4</a>)_
