> So we typically look in ways that actually lead to clinging, lead to suffering. That's what we do all the time. The Buddha said, "Can you learn to look in different ways that bring release?"

> Why did the Buddha go on and on and on and on about clinging? Clinging brings suffering. Clinging closes the heart. Releasing clinging brings freedom; it also brings love. And we can notice this so we're crystal clear about it, and there's just no arguing about it. It's very, very clear to us. We feel it in the heart and in the body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > f feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#f feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre" class="internal-link">f) feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre</a>_</span>
