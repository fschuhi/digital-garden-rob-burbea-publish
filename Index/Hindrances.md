> And so, rather than being hungry for it and sort of reliant on sense pleasure, we can be open to the pleasure through the senses, but it's actually a sense of wonder or mystery through the senses that we're tuning into more and more, rather than the aspect of it being pleasant or unpleasant... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Joy (talk) > Piti is the physical aspect of spiritual joy not based on sense pleasure" data-href="Joy (talk)#Piti is the physical aspect of spiritual joy not based on sense pleasure" class="internal-link">Piti is the physical aspect of spiritual joy, not based on sense pleasure</a>_</span>

> When restlessness comes up, we have aversion to the restlessness. It's unpleasant, the very sense of restlessness.

> **Bring the attention back to myself, and actually notice and feel the _dukkha_ of that ill-will _here_ .** _It's in_ my _heart. There's a taste in my mouth. It's a flavour in my energy body and my consciousness. It's_ dukkha. It's painful. So I'm not trying to change the ill-will. I just come back, and I feel what's happening. Don't judge, just: "What does it feel like? Oh, it's _dukkha_." And feel the pain of it. I just have to let my consciousness touch the pain there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > a Ill-will i Metta to the one Im upset with ii to myself" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#a Ill-will i Metta to the one I'm upset with ii to myself" class="internal-link">(a) Ill-will, (i) Metta to the one I&#x27;m upset with (ii) to myself</a>_</span>

> Instead of the automatic, natural aversion to the hindrances, I'm actually saying, "Come, come, I'll take this." But it has heart in it. It has this, "I'm willing to take this suffering right now. I'm opening myself to the suffering for the sake of the release from suffering of someone else, somewhere." So it's a kind of, you could say, 'magical thinking' - it doesn't matter - using your imagination, whatever. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Exchanging happiness of self and other" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Exchanging happiness of self and other" class="internal-link">Exchanging happiness of self and other</a>_</span>

> I'm playing with and experimenting with all that, and I can use all my ingenuity and creativity in how I relate to hindrances or what might help. And at the same time, I have a firm resolve. I'm not just going to give up now. I'm not just going to get up and walk away, or just sit through it and say, "Oh, whatever. Who cares." There's this combination of working actively, of being creative and ingenious, and a firm resolve and patience, all together. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Im patient while Im working with the hindrances" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#I'm patient while I'm working with the hindrances" class="internal-link">I&#x27;m patient while I&#x27;m working with the hindrances</a>_</span>

> Hindrances - don't take them personally. They're a human thing. They're like facts of being human, and the arising of a hindrance doesn't mean anything about my capability as a meditator or my worthiness as a human being. That's really, really important. So, can I encourage that attitude? And that's part of where we want to move towards. That's part of the gift of _jhāna_ practice. We begin, after a while, to see: it's not personal. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > 3 Do not take the hindrances personally they are a fact of being human" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#3 Do not take the hindrances personally they are a fact of being human" class="internal-link">(3) Do not take the hindrances personally, they are a fact of being human</a>_</span>

> [T]his development of subtlety and refinement and discrimination - that also happens in regard to the hindrances. In terms of our overall trajectory, this recognition and working with the subtlety of the spectrum of the hindrance is also part of that whole development of subtlety. Yes, it's much nicer, attuning and discerning to subtle differences of _this_ kind of exquisite peacefulness versus _that_ kind of exquisite peacefulness, but in terms of developing the whole subtlety - which again, is so important for our emotional life and all the rest of it - that's important too. It's all subtlety. It's all discrimination. It's all attunement. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Development of subtelty and refinement and discrimination also happens in regard to the hindrances" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Development of subtelty and refinement and discrimination also happens in regard to the hindrances" class="internal-link">Development of subtelty and refinement and discrimination also happens in regard to the hindrances</a>_</span>

> So, over a long time of _jhāna_ practice, there is this movement of shaving away the gross, getting down to the hindrances, and then even more subtle. But they stay. They're part of the deal. And we need to be okay with that, really up for that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Over time self-view manifest less as papanca and more as pure hindrance" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Over time self-view manifest less as papanca and more as pure hindrance" class="internal-link">Over time, self-view manifest less as papanca and more as pure hindrance</a>_</span>
