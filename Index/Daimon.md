> So Corbin, of course, talked a lot about - actually I, before, talked about - "the angel out ahead."

> This angel, in the mystery of their being, in the mystery of this angelic constellation, this angelic relationship, this angel is both other and self. But it's [[Divinity|theophany]]. It's a face of the divine. It's an expression of the divine, which is different than an <a data-href="emptiness" class="internal-link">emptiness</a>. An emptiness is not a theophany.

So that infinite echoing and mirroring is of the angel into this person's life, and this person's life and this person's being as the infinite echoing and mirroring of the angel, and the angel also a mirror and an echo of the being, in a kind of two-way, back-and-forth echoing and mirroring each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3 > Words like angel soul image imply unfathomability" data-href="Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Words like 'angel' 'soul' 'image' imply unfathomability" class="internal-link">Words like &#x27;angel&#x27;, &#x27;soul&#x27;, &#x27;image&#x27; imply unfathomability</a>_</span>
