> So it's joy that comes from cultivation of the beautiful qualities of heart; joy that comes from appreciation, cultivating appreciation; joy that comes from opening, from connecting, from perceiving beauty, from developing our capacity to perceive beauty, from the deepening of our practice, joy in practice itself, joy in the Dharma, joy in the teachings, in hearing the teachings, in the Saṅgha, in the community of people who love to practise, who are interested in practising.

> So there's certainly a movement from formal practice that flows out into the life, but the other way round as well.

> And these become very charged concepts: 'what is,' 'things as they are.' But again, that's never, never, never the goal of the path. It's a beautiful way of practising. It's a beautiful way of being - _cannot_ be the goal of the path. The goal of the path is an understanding, a very deep understanding, that brings freedom with it. It brings freedom.

> There's something in opening to a state like that - whatever it is, infinite consciousness pervading the universe - these are all quite related states, very, very, potentially incredibly transforming for the long term.

> What I really want to explore is the assumptions underneath how we think of and conceive the Dharma, practice, the path, etc. The way we think and conceive of the Dharma, and the assumptions _underneath_ how we're thinking of and conceiving of practice, path, Dharma, are not often at the forefront of our minds.

The concepts, if I try and stretch too small a set of concepts over the range of things that we deeply care about, the whole structure will snap. It's not adequate. It cannot support it.

> We want _more_ than ease and peace - certainly, probably certainly, than either the kind of ease and peace that is just a matter of stress reduction, or coping with pain, painful sensations. Even we want more than the ease and peace of the most profound kind, the most comprehensive kind. So look. See. Even within the Dharma, isn't it more than ease you want? Isn't it more than _that_ that you're looking for? Yes, there's ease. There's the ease of suffering that we're after. And what? If you love the Dharma, it's not just that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > Human beings want more than easeand peace" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Human beings want more than easeand peace" class="internal-link">Human beings want more than easeand peace</a>_</span>

> And always in Dharma inquiry, always, there's something really fundamental to see: there's a principle that how we view something - always we see that how we view something affects the perception of that 'something.' The ideas that I have, the preconceptions, the conceptions, the relationship with the 'something' that I'm investigating, the area of inquiry, affects my perception of that 'something,' and affects the related experiences that unfold, that can unfold, or that will unfold. All that's to do with dependent arising. The view, the way of looking, affects.
