> So this is quite interesting. Sometimes also the reason we are not so attracted to the idea of equanimity is that we have come to feel and believe that our sense of some juice in life, of juiciness, is wrapped up in drama - in the drama of the self, the drama of getting or getting rid of, of some difficulty or this or that - and when that drama dies down a bit, we're a little bit unsure if what will remain will be a bit grey or a bit boring. It's hard to imagine that maybe equanimity, true equanimity, actually has a quality of juiciness in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > The near enemy is indifference and lack of juicyness in life" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#The near enemy is indifference and lack of juicyness in life" class="internal-link">The near enemy is indifference and lack of juicyness in life</a>_</span>

> The [sense of self](app://obsidian.md/The%20Self) is fixed, lasting, permanent, steady. And I look inside, and all I see is impermanence, so therefore no fixed self. It's not really real in the way that I thought it was. All I can say there _is_ is a continuum of mind moments, a continuum of experiences through time.
