> So, you know, the analogy of, there's the mountain, and there's the peak of the mountain, and that's where we're headed, but the step is right here, right now. And we can see where we're going, and pay attention to where we are right now. And it's both.

> There's a kind of grasping that goes on with attention.

> So part of the developing the art is deepening this sensitivity and subtlety of attention to effort levels.

> A wrong kind of self-attention feeds, builds the ego and builds the self-sense, whereas an attention that's full of compassion, full of tenderness, full of acceptance and care, full of insight into questioning, "How is it that this suffering has come about?" - that kind of direction of the attention towards self does not build the ego, will not build the ego, will actually soften things, will actually allow things to become looser and more spacious. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves > Compassion to self does not build the ego" data-href="Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Compassion to self does not build the ego" class="internal-link">Compassion to self does not build the ego</a>_</span>

> There's no sensation there in the knee any more. I'm staring right at it. It's not that I'm not paying attention. I'm certainly not distracted. It's faded. It's unfabricated. And I start to see, again: dependent on the way of looking is the construction of my experience, my perception, and what appears to me. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Even the pleasant vedana become neutral and even those neutral sensations disappear" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Even the pleasant vedana become neutral and even those neutral sensations disappear" class="internal-link">Even the pleasant vedana become neutral, and even those neutral sensations disappear</a>_</span>

> Not just that it is not me and it is not mine, but it is, in itself, empty. It's an illusory appearance, to borrow the Buddha's terminology. It's a fabrication. It's a concoction. It's a construction - a construction dependent on the way of looking. If I look in a certain way, the world appears, and it appears very solid. If I look in other ways, it appears, but it appears much less solid. And if I look in certain ways, certain ways of looking, if I pay attention in certain ways of looking, it does not appear. This thing that was troubling me, this thing that I loved, this thing that was neutral, fades. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > Not just that is not me but it is empty" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Not just that is not me but it is empty" class="internal-link">Not just that is not me, but it is empty</a>_</span>

> The mind kind of grasps - like a pair of calipers, it grasps at the object that we're paying attention to.

> I can't live without clinging, because clinging is a part of perceiving/experiencing anything. As I said, it's part of attention. And when I really let go of clinging very deeply, in that moment, appearances do not appear. There is no perception. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2 > I cannot live without clinging because it is a part of perceiving" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#I cannot live without clinging because it is a part of perceiving" class="internal-link">I cannot live without clinging because it is a part of perceiving</a>_</span>

> Certainly in our wider culture, it's like, "What do you _mean_ when you say 'vibration,' 'texture,' 'feeling,' 'energy'?"

> If you can get a sense, it's like the space feels relaxed. It's not heavy, intense attention. Intense attention has its place, and we'll talk about that - the energization of attention. But what I'm really talking about as we move around is a kind of open, easeful attention, and an open, easeful body, and they go together. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > During the day aim for a whole-body awareness that is quite relaxed and open" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#During the day aim for a whole-body awareness that is quite relaxed and open" class="internal-link">During the day, aim for a whole-body awareness that is quite relaxed and open</a>_</span>

It's a flavour in my energy body and my consciousness. It's_ dukkha. It's painful. So I'm not trying to change the ill-will. I just come back, and I feel what's happening. Don't judge, just: "What does it feel like? Oh, it's _dukkha_." And feel the pain of it.
