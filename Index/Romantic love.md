> Can I have a conceptual framework, can I form, can I open to a conceptual framework and a fantasy that, actually, romantic love becomes part of the path, and not just in those kind of simplistic terms? The concepts, if I try and stretch too small a set of concepts over the range of things that we deeply care about, the whole structure will snap. It's not adequate. It cannot support it. It cannot nourish those areas that we really care about, _if_ we really care about them. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > When I stretch a limited conceptual framework over things I care deeply about the whole structure will snap" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#When I stretch a limited conceptual framework over things I care deeply about the whole structure will snap" class="internal-link">When I stretch a limited conceptual framework over things I care deeply about, the whole structure will snap</a>_</span>
