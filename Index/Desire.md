> And, conversely, the investigation of my soul-passions, and my desire in relation to that, and that kind of eros, whether it's really strong or much more subtle, won't be - it will actually tell me _something_ about dependent origination and emptiness, _something_, but not enough for the full monty there, the full depth of that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3 > Each of the three are different doors directions avenues" data-href="The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Each of the three are different doors directions avenues" class="internal-link">Each of the three are different doors, directions, avenues</a>_</span>

> [E]ros, a desire, a movement of the psyche, of the being, that opens, deepens, leads to soulfulness, sacredness, soulmaking, sense of sacredness. Opens that out.

> And some people don't seem to have an interest or a desire, there's not much libido, if you like, towards awakening in general. They don't talk about it. They don't listen to talks that mention it. When it's talked about, they'll just lose interest. They'll actually say - I've heard many people say to me, "I'm just not interested." So that's interesting, too, to me. Why?

> Practising in that way, actually respecting the desire and, if you like, empowering it - without necessarily acting on it; we're talking about a meditation here - practising this way leads to an experience where the desire does not bring _dukkha._ Quite the opposite: it brings a kind of fulfilment and opening of the being. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > Practice allowing dukkha without acting on it" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Practice allowing dukkha without acting on it" class="internal-link">Practice: allowing dukkha, without acting on it</a>_</span>
