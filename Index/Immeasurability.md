> How a thing appears depends on my relationship to it. Whether it appears at all depends on my relationship to it. How a thing is, then, depends on the push and the pull, and is inherently immeasurable. There is no real way it is. It's immeasurable. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > More important than the experience is the understanding how things appearing depends on my relationship to them" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#More important than the experience is the understanding how things appearing depends on my relationship to them" class="internal-link">More important than the experience is the understanding how things appearing depends on my relationship to them</a>_</span>

> When the mind, when the heart, is small, restricted, that karma ripens - the memory of what we did, or what happened to us or whatever - ripens in that context of the restricted, the constricted heart. In the unrestricted heart, the immeasurable heart - so one that is either immeasurable through loving-kindness and compassion, or joy or equanimity, one of the _brahmavihāras_, immeasurable that way, or unrestricted through _samādhi_ or through insight - in the unrestricted heart, when that karma ripens, when it comes up, when the memory comes up or the effects from the past come up, memory or otherwise, it's in a very different context. And the Buddha said it will barely be noticed. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Ripening of karma from the past" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Ripening of karma from the past" class="internal-link">Ripening of karma from the past</a>_</span>
