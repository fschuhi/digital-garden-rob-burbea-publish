> So we see sorrow in someone, and somehow we also feel sorrow. This is, to me, a miraculous quality of the human heart - maybe some animals' as well; I don't know. The heart has a capacity to resonate, in a very beautiful way, with the sorrow that it encounters in the world. So that's a huge part of compassion. Maybe half of compassion is empathy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Compassion involves different qualities e g empathy" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Compassion involves different qualities e g empathy" class="internal-link">Compassion involves different qualities, e.g. empathy</a>_</span>

> [W]hen the [compassion](https://publish.obsidian.md/rob-burbea/Index/Compassion) has gone off into righteous anger or we feel that kind of anger come in, it's actually painful for us. So sometimes this might happen in the course of your practice, if you're giving compassion to the difficult person. To take a moment and just give the compassion to oneself, recognizing there's some pain there. If I'm involved in judgment, if I'm involved in blame, in anger, in all that, my heart is burning, my heart is [contracted](https://publish.obsidian.md/rob-burbea/Index/Contraction) and painful. Just to take a moment, and turn round, and feel that pain, and touch it with compassion to oneself, and then to go out again. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > When feeling the pain of anger coming in remember to give compassion to yourself" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#When feeling the pain of anger coming in remember to give compassion to yourself" class="internal-link">When feeling the pain of anger coming in, remember to give compassion to yourself</a>_</span>

> [Compassion](https://publish.obsidian.md/rob-burbea/Index/Compassion) is something that's actually energizing and healing, and moves towards the alleviation of suffering. Self-pity will just keep it cycling. It's disempowering. It actually _keeps_ suffering there. Compassion to self and other is empowering and not debilitating. So in the practice, you can see: when has pity crept in, and is there some way I can equalize things again? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Self-pity is disempowering" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Self-pity is disempowering" class="internal-link">Self-pity is disempowering</a>_</span>

> In that climate of compassion, with a little bit more broad awareness, it's like a lens of looking at the present moment, the present experience, through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering, in the moment. So we begin to see little sufferings, little ways that we're creating suffering. And organically somehow, because of the compassion practice, we can just unhook. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > Looking at the present experience through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#Looking at the present experience through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering" class="internal-link">Looking at the present experience, through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering</a>_</span>

> But the space is quite important. Just a space radiating compassion. Sometimes it can feel like you're just resting in that space, and there's very little doing, very little phrases. It's just sort of not doing much; it's just a space of compassion. That can be very helpful. Sometimes, again to emphasize, to be as much as possible in the body with it. So it's almost like the body becomes compassion. It's just radiating out compassion. You've become compassion... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Practice of Compassion > A space radiating compassion" data-href="The Practice of Compassion#A space radiating compassion" class="internal-link">A space radiating compassion</a>_</span>

> So what we notice is, if we change the view, the perception changes. The irritability goes from the situation.

> So it's just whatever's in consciousness, whatever's prominent, there the mettā goes. And also quite quick to see what the relationship with things is.

> That principle is something that applies to all consciousnesses - not even just human beings; all consciousnesses. Whenever there's a consciousness, the appearance of things to that consciousness depends on the push and the pull, the relationship with. And that's universal.
