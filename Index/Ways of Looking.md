> Human consciousness is programmed incredibly strongly to go to that default mode. What we begin to see in practice is that default way of seeing is not the reality. If we throw out what I would call the deeper senses of oneness, of an infinite love, whatever you want to call it, if we throw that out too quickly, we just go back to the default, and in a way, we're not challenging that default mode enough. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Love and Emptiness > But dont be in a hurry as the power of those kinds of perceptions transforms heart and mind" data-href="Love and Emptiness#But don't be in a hurry as the power of those kinds of perceptions transforms heart and mind" class="internal-link">But don&#x27;t be in a hurry, as the power of those kinds of perceptions transforms heart and mind</a>_</span>

> Put that on as a lens, a way of seeing, as a practice. So this is moving beyond what we might call "simple mindfulness" or "simple presence or being," and actually deliberately taking up a certain mode of seeing, a certain way of looking at experience, for a period of time... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="What is Insight > Another way to consolidate the insight is to use it as a mode of seeing" data-href="What is Insight#Another way to consolidate the insight is to use it as a mode of seeing" class="internal-link">Another way to consolidate the insight is to use it as a mode of seeing</a>_</span>

> So I'm talking about modes of seeing that we can pick up and use, that lead to a sense of freedom.

> So part of what 'practise' means is playing with ways of looking, shaking things up, saying, "Let me look at this another way.

> What certain situations need is very relative, conventional language. We need to talk about our emotions; we need to express what we feel to each other; we need to respect that. I need to respect my emotions and your emotions at that level. So in that moment, that's what's helpful, that way of looking. But I'm saying a mature practice is able to move between picking that up, putting it down, picking up other ways of seeing - emptiness, _anattÄ_, etc. - and putting them down, not getting stuck in one or the other. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion > Maturity in practice comes from being able to move between different ways of seeing" data-href="Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Maturity in practice comes from being able to move between different ways of seeing" class="internal-link">Maturity in practice comes from being able to move between different ways of seeing</a>_</span>

> Big ideas can open up the whole sense of existence - the questioning, the perception, everything. That opening up won't happen just by 'being with,' or just by being with my feelings, if I'm 'being with' with the same unquestioned ways of looking, unquestioned conceptual framework, etc., unquestioned metaphysics, really.

> This isn't a big, laborious thinking process. It's a way of looking. It's immediate. It's something that's permeating my very perceiving.

> There's no sensation there in the knee any more. I'm staring right at it. It's not that I'm not paying attention. I'm certainly not distracted. It's faded. It's unfabricated.

> Not just that it is not me and it is not mine, but it is, in itself, empty. It's an illusory appearance, to borrow the Buddha's terminology. It's a fabrication. It's a concoction. It's a construction - a construction dependent on the way of looking. If I look in a certain way, the world appears, and it appears very solid. If I look in other ways, it appears, but it appears much less solid. And if I look in certain ways, certain ways of looking, if I pay attention in certain ways of looking, it does not appear.
