### Quotes
**[[Love and Emptiness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Human consciousness is programmed incredibly strongly to go to that default mode. What we begin to see in practice is that default way of seeing is not the reality. If we throw out what I would call the deeper senses of oneness, of an infinite love, whatever you want to call it, if we throw that out too quickly, we just go back to the default, and in a way, we're not challenging that default mode enough. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#But don't be in a hurry as the power of those kinds of perceptions transforms heart and mind|But don't be in a hurry, as the power of those kinds of perceptions transforms heart and mind]]_</span>

**[[What is Insight]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> Put that on as a lens, a way of seeing, as a practice. So this is moving beyond what we might call "simple mindfulness" or "simple presence or being," and actually deliberately taking up a certain mode of seeing, a certain way of looking at experience, for a period of time... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Another way to consolidate the insight is to use it as a mode of seeing|Another way to consolidate the insight is to use it as a mode of seeing]]_</span>

> So you're actually using it in the moment as a way of feeling into freedom, of opening up into freedom. It's a way of seeing, a way of looking. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#You contemplate impermance in the right way it brings joy|You contemplate impermance in the right way, it brings joy]]_</span>

> So I'm talking about modes of seeing that we can pick up and use, that lead to a sense of freedom. If they lead to a sense of agitation or confusion, existentially or all the rest of it, torment - wrong! Put it away! Do something else. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Commentaries point towards a "dark night of the soul" but I don't think that's how insight works|Commentaries point towards a "dark night of the soul", but I don't think that's how insight works]]_</span>

**[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So part of what 'practise' means is playing with ways of looking, shaking things up, saying, "Let me look at this another way. Let me practise looking at this another way," until that other way, which brings freedom with it, which brings love with it... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#This individuality is bound up with everything else in the universe|This individuality is bound up with everything else in the universe]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> What certain situations need is very relative, conventional language. We need to talk about our emotions; we need to express what we feel to each other; we need to respect that. I need to respect my emotions and your emotions at that level. So in that moment, that's what's helpful, that way of looking. But I'm saying a mature practice is able to move between picking that up, putting it down, picking up other ways of seeing - emptiness, _anattā_, etc. - and putting them down, not getting stuck in one or the other. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Maturity in practice comes from being able to move between different ways of seeing|Maturity in practice comes from being able to move between different ways of seeing]]_</span>

**[[Love and the Emptiness of Things]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Vast sense of oneness - beautiful. Beautiful for consciousness to open up to, at times. But even that is actually empty. It's still a perception that's come into being through the way we are looking, through our relationship _with_. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Even oneness is a perception which comes into being through the way we are looking|Even oneness is a perception which comes into being through the way we are looking]]_</span>

**[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> There are many ways of seeing emptiness. But the point of a practice like what we've introduced this week is that one sees it over and over. One does this over and over until, more and more, the coin drops. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Contemplation of emptiness is very gradual|Contemplation of emptiness is very gradual]]_</span>

**[[Questioning Awakening]]**
<span class="counts">[[2014 November Solitary - Questioning Awakening]]</span>
> Is there not, in the way that you feel and relate to practice, a whole kind of mythos, a whole kind of ethos, a whole particular kind of beauty that you relate to, that speaks to you, that touches your soul? Wrapped up in that, a whole way of seeing existence? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Questioning Awakening#It's not just the reduction of suffering we are here for|It's not just the reduction of suffering we are here for]]_</span>

> Big ideas can open up the whole sense of existence - the questioning, the perception, everything. That opening up won't happen just by 'being with,' or just by being with my feelings, if I'm 'being with' with the same unquestioned ways of looking, unquestioned conceptual framework, etc., unquestioned metaphysics, really. We somehow need to question and to put in new ideas. Somehow. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Questioning Awakening#Is a wholly different relationship with fundamental ideas possible|Is a wholly different relationship with fundamental ideas possible?]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> But always at some moment, the mind, the being, is somewhere on that spectrum of how much clinging and what kinds of clinging are going on in the way of looking. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#There is always a way of looking with more or less clinging|There is always a way of looking, with more or less clinging]]_</span>

> This isn't a big, laborious thinking process. It's a way of looking. It's immediate. It's something that's permeating my very perceiving. It's a conception, for sure, but it's also a cutting or replacing of the usual unconscious conception, which is "this is me, this is mine." &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Anatta practice whatever comes up is not self not me not mine|Anatta practice: whatever comes up is not self, not me, not mine]]_</span>

> There's no sensation there in the knee any more. I'm staring right at it. It's not that I'm not paying attention. I'm certainly not distracted. It's faded. It's unfabricated. And I start to see, again: dependent on the way of looking is the construction of my experience, my perception, and what appears to me. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Even the pleasant vedana become neutral and even those neutral sensations disappear|Even the pleasant vedana become neutral, and even those neutral sensations disappear]]_</span>

> Not just that it is not me and it is not mine, but it is, in itself, empty. It's an illusory appearance, to borrow the Buddha's terminology. It's a fabrication. It's a concoction. It's a construction - a construction dependent on the way of looking. If I look in a certain way, the world appears, and it appears very solid. If I look in other ways, it appears, but it appears much less solid. And if I look in certain ways, certain ways of looking, if I pay attention in certain ways of looking, it does not appear. This thing that was troubling me, this thing that I loved, this thing that was neutral, fades. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Not just that is not me but it is empty|Not just that is not me, but it is empty]]_</span>

> [I]n whatever posture in practice, that just sees things, and the way of looking says, "Empty, empty, empty" - meaning I _know_; I don't have to have this shorthand whole thinking thing. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Practice "empty empty empty"|Practice: "empty, empty, empty"]]_</span>

> Everyone seems to talk as if these things are real - bare sensations, or if I'm in a certain culture, the atomic process of mind moments and experiences. Is that the ultimate reality? Or is that just a certain level of less fabrication? So I keep this framework of ways of looking and fabrication, and I just see. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Bare sensations etc is not ultimate reality|Bare sensations etc. is not ultimate reality]]_</span>

> I cannot have a full leaning on the insight of emptiness at the same time as I have the appearance of an object. It will fade to the degree that I lean on, that I allow the fullness of that knowing of its emptiness into the way of looking. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Only Buddhas can contemplate emptiness and appearance at the same time|Only Buddhas can contemplate emptiness and appearance at the same time]]_</span>

> This was an incredible skill of the Buddha, finding concepts that we can pick up and use as ways of looking, and if we approach it in that spirit, we begin to see that the very ways of looking lead to other ways of looking. The whole thing kind of dissolves itself and opens up a freedom of experience, but also a freedom of understanding, what comes with understanding. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#The links of dependent origination are not real either|The links of dependent origination are not real either]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> _[A]vijjā_ is clinging, this belief in the reality of something existing independently from the way of looking. It's a clinging. I need to refine my practice until I can actually play with the spectrum, actually move that clinging of delusion up and down on a spectrum, and see what happens. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#2 spectrum of fabrication emptiness|2. spectrum of fabrication (emptiness)]]_</span>

> [T]here are some who can't wait. They have to include and learn as they go along, through different ways of looking, different practices, trial and error (with the help, hopefully, of the teachers), but to discern between these different movements: what's _papañca_? What's imaginal practice? It's possible. It's absolutely possible. But in a way, parallel tracks are running concurrently. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#There are some who cannot wait|There are some who cannot wait]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> And always in Dharma inquiry, always, there's something really fundamental to see: there's a principle that how we view something - always we see that how we view something affects the perception of that 'something.' The ideas that I have, the preconceptions, the conceptions, the relationship with the 'something' that I'm investigating, the area of inquiry, affects my perception of that 'something,' and affects the related experiences that unfold, that can unfold, or that will unfold. All that's to do with dependent arising. The view, the way of looking, affects. It shapes the perception, fabrication. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#3 Opening a direction of investigation|3. Opening a direction of investigation]]_</span>

> One of the immense strengths of the Buddha's teaching and Dharma teaching is that he kind of gives us a set of concepts, and in a way, they become ways of looking. That's what these concepts are; they become ways of looking. But they serve to simplify. So Dharma concepts serve to simplify, simplify because they fabricate less. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Dharma concepts aim towards less papanca|Dharma concepts aim towards less papanca]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> So the whole kind of mishmash of conditioning factors in the perceiving makes the way of looking. And there's _always_ a way of looking. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#2 Ways of looking - including the relationship of what I'm perceiving|(2) Ways of looking - including the relationship of what I'm perceiving]]_</span>

> So there's a spectrum of fabrication, and different ways of looking fabricate more or less, all the way to extremely gross and solid and oppressive, to much, much less fabricated, less fabricated, less fabricated, etc., down into not fabricating at all. What's fabricated there, as I said, is _dukkha_, is dis-ease and suffering, but also the sense of self, the sense of object, the sense of world, the sense of time - all of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#3 Fabrication|(3) Fabrication]]_</span>

> Without the way of looking, and without being _fabricated_ by the way of looking, there is not the appearance of that thing. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#4 Emptiness|(4) Emptiness]]_</span>

> [W]e start with this notion of ways of looking, and we end up with this really radical, thorough insight that in the end there are only ways of looking. The ways of looking are empty, too, but all we have is a range of ways of looking, which we can expand. And those are not realities; those are ways of looking. Those ways of looking also don't inherently exist. But all we have, all we come to, the freedom that we come to, is there are just ways of looking. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Emptiness is a radical pervasive concept|Emptiness is a radical, pervasive concept]]_</span>

> So in the meaning of the word 'image,' it's not just an object. It includes the way of looking at that object... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#An imaginal figure has a kind of otherness and autonomy|An imaginal figure has a kind of otherness and autonomy]]_</span>

> What's soulmaking? It's anything, any activity or way of looking or way of being, that gives rise to a sense of soulfulness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#6 Soulmaking|(6) Soulmaking]]_</span>

> I'm referring to a mode of attending to the experience of body - a way of looking... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#8 Energy body|(8) Energy body]]_</span>

> But when I talk about logos, because it's wrapped up in perception, I'm not talking about something abstract. We _live_ a logos, or we live logoi. We live different ideas. Different concepts shape how we live, they inform how we live, but more fundamentally, they shape our way of looking. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#There is always a logos operating in the mind except during an experience of the Unfabricated|There is always a logos operating in the mind (except during an experience of the Unfabricated]]_</span>

**[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2020 Vajra Music]]</span>
> Oftentimes it's the 'making' that people don't relate to, the word 'making.' Of course, if you understand the whole track of exploration of [[ways of looking]] and [[fabrication]] ('fabrication' is just another word for 'making'), and how that deepens, and how it opens out, and the understanding it opens out, then the word 'making' is almost an indispensable word in 'soulmaking.' But for a lot of people, it's very puzzling, because you'd usually think of the word 'soul,' or have a sense of soul, or use that in a very reified way: it wouldn't be something that we _make_. It would be something that _is_, or we discover, or that just is a level of being or whatever. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#A teacher said "I don't really relate to the word 'soul'"|A teacher said: "I don't really relate to the word 'soul'"]]_</span>
