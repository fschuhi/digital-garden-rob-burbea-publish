> So sometimes it will feel like we're very much in the 'feeling the sorrow' side, where very much there's quite some sadness, or grief, or just being moved. And sometimes it can be very lovely, and there's a sweetness to it, there's a beauty to it; the heart is open and touched. And sometimes it feels like the balance is more, we're just feeling in, tuning into that energy that's going out - the lovely quality of healing, of light, the balm, the comforting. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > 2 Wanting to heal the suffering energy" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#2 Wanting to heal the suffering energy" class="internal-link">(2) Wanting to heal the suffering (energy)</a>_</span>

> So it's joy that comes from cultivation of the beautiful qualities of heart; joy that comes from appreciation, cultivating appreciation; joy that comes from opening, from connecting, from perceiving beauty, from developing our capacity to perceive beauty, from the deepening of our practice, joy in practice itself, joy in the Dharma, joy in the teachings, in hearing the teachings, in the Saṅgha, in the community of people who love to practise, who are interested in practising.

> You know, sometimes you want to be a bit more inner, and it's appropriate to be with one's own experience. But other times, open up. Can there be an appreciation of the beauty of what's going on here and the loveliness of everyone practising together, trying together, supporting each other, in the silence, in the schedule, and all that? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice > There are many things to appreciate" data-href="The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#There are many things to appreciate" class="internal-link">There are many things to appreciate</a>_</span>

More and more, as I said, this grows, the divinity of the object, of the erotic object. Eros opens the perception of beauty and divinity, and we can't help but love what appears to us deeply beautiful and divine. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4 > But its not possible to have eros without love" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#But it's not possible to have eros without love" class="internal-link">But it&#x27;s not possible to have eros without love</a>_</span>

> We have all kinds of reasons and social taboos and cultural conditionings and whatnot, and contractions of being, and psychology - it's harder to have that, to recognize the beauty and the dimensionality, and to have an erotic relationship with oneself. So one kind of externalizes it by just making it image. Don't worry if it's not imaginal at first. It can very soon _become_ imaginal, more fully imaginal, with the eros there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Daimon, Refracted > Sometimes its easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when its externalized like that" data-href="Daimon, Refracted#Sometimes it's easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it's externalized like that" class="internal-link">Sometimes it&#x27;s easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it&#x27;s externalized like that</a>_</span>
