There are always new horizons of awakening opening up. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > High bar in Theravada; for Rob its an endlessly expanding notion of awakening" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#High bar in Theravada; for Rob it's an endlessly expanding notion of awakening" class="internal-link">High bar in Theravada; for Rob it&#x27;s an endlessly expanding notion of awakening</a>_</span>
