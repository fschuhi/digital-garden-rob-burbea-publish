- theophany
- faces of the divine
- [[Henry Corbin]]

> And the angel, the <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, is other, _and_ it's self. It's both and neither. It's me and not me, and it's not me and _not_ not me. This angel, in the mystery of their being, in the mystery of this angelic constellation, this angelic relationship, this angel is both other and self. But it's [[Divinity|theophany]]. It's a face of the divine.

> An emptiness is not a theophany. An emptiness is usually construed as an essence, usually construed as a transcendent essence beyond all attributes. A theophany is a face, a presentation of, we could say, attributes, or is a being in itself, a person in itself, you could say.
