- theophany
- faces of the divine
- [[Henry Corbin]]

> And the angel, the <a data-href="image" class="internal-link">image</a>, is other, _and_ it's self. It's both and neither. It's me and not me, and it's not me and _not_ not me. This angel, in the mystery of their being, in the mystery of this angelic constellation, this angelic relationship, this angel is both other and self. But it's [[Divinity|theophany]]. It's a face of the divine.

> An emptiness is not a theophany. An emptiness is usually construed as an essence, usually construed as a transcendent essence beyond all attributes. A theophany is a face, a presentation of, we could say, attributes, or is a being in itself, a person in itself, you could say.

> [E]veryone uses the word self: I, you, self, etc. And everyone experiences selves. Everyone experiences selves - their own self or selves, and the selves of others. It's just the same, or rather it's similar with the notion of divinity. We're talking about experience, okay? Just as 'self' is a word that we use, an experience, so is 'divinity' - or rather, 'divinity' is a whole range of experiences, a whole range of dimensions of experiences, if you like, that will become evident, that will appear in one's experience, _if_ we do not block, dismiss, or rule it out. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3 > Divinity is a whole range of experiences" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Divinity is a whole range of experiences" class="internal-link">&quot;Divinity&quot; is a whole range of experiences</a>_</span>
