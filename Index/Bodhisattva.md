> Moving away from the kind of sense of consolation one gets from God or bodhisattva or whatever it is, away from that to _thy will_, and actually into the dark night of the soul, where one feels one isn't getting anything. There's something in that darkness, in that not getting. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane" class="internal-link">Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane</a>_</span>

> It's all empty. At one level, nothing happened. At another level, I'm right there. That's what allows a bodhisattva to be a bodhisattva, is that the emptiness and the compassion are together. Without that, forget about it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Birth of a Bodhisattva > The bodhisattva can make such a huge aspiration because theyre holding the compassion with the emptiness of it all" data-href="The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The bodhisattva can make such a huge aspiration because they're holding the compassion with the emptiness of it all" class="internal-link">The bodhisattva can make such a huge aspiration because they&#x27;re holding the compassion with the emptiness of it all</a>_</span>
