> So the mind, the heart, the being staying steady, staying balanced, unshakeable, whatever happens, whatever's going on, whatever is coming to the senses.

> So it has a certain feeling-tone, equanimity, to it, a certain peacefulness, a certain stillness, and it's the mind kind of tuning into that wavelength, that resonance, and just being there with it, noticing it, feeling it, opening to it, and enjoying it, enjoying it, that allows it to deepen, to settle in the being. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity in Compassion > 3 Equanimity deepens when the mind tunes into the feeling-tone of equanimity" data-href="Equanimity in Compassion#3 Equanimity deepens when the mind tunes into the feeling-tone of equanimity" class="internal-link">(3) Equanimity deepens when the mind tunes into the feeling-tone of equanimity</a>_</span>

> So this practice that we've been doing this week, with directing kindness towards things, and sometimes the things fade - one actually sees that, through the lack of kindness or the lack of acceptance, a perception is actually getting built, it's getting fabricated or compounded, to use the Buddha's words, constructed in the moment.
