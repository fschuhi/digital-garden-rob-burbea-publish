> Sacredness never resides in this or that object or thing; we sacralize. We make something or other sacred through our relationship with it. So there's the possibility of sacralizing sexuality, rather than just viewing eros or sexuality as a defilement, or as leading inevitably to defilement. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1 > 2 Opening to the recognition of the sacredness of eros itself" data-href="Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#2 Opening to the recognition of the sacredness of eros itself" class="internal-link">2.
