> We have to get the view right (the view is the platform), and the whole relationship right. So if I say something like that - "Oh, the Buddha said, '_Jhānas_ depend on happiness'" - that should set you thinking. Well, I see some of you writing it down.

> You won't access _jhānas_ unless you're willing to be malleable, and you play and you play, and get into trying different things.

> When I say '_jhāna_ practice,' I mean also working with the difficulties, the yucky stuff, the sludge, and slogging away through it, etc. I mean also, when I say '_jhāna_ practice,' the whole relationship with practice, the whole view of the self doing the practice, and trying to do the practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Orienting to This Jhana Retreat > We want firm clear simple intention for jhana practice" data-href="Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#We want firm clear simple intention for jhana practice" class="internal-link">We want firm, clear, simple intention for &quot;jhana practice&quot;</a>_</span>

> _Jhānas_ are a subset of _samādhi_, if you like. And _samādhi_ - it's actually quite hard to define, but it's something like a state of harmonious well-being of mind and body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="An Introduction to the Jhanas > Vocabulary jhanas are a subset of samadhi" data-href="An Introduction to the Jhanas#Vocabulary jhanas are a subset of samadhi" class="internal-link">Vocabulary: jhanas are a subset of samadhi</a>_</span>

> [M]aybe most people, really need to forget the whole question that goes on: "Do I have it now? Is this it? Am I in a _jhāna_, or am I out of a _jhāna_ ?"

> We need to sit in a _jhāna_ a long time. It's doing a lot of work on the cells, on the being, on the _citta_. It's fine to go through for two seconds on the way - that's all fine, but the real work happens when we really just get in and sit there for a long time, and really let that change our habits, our mental habits, and our energetic habits. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="An Introduction to the Jhanas > Mastery includes staying in a particular jhana in any posture; marinate in it" data-href="An Introduction to the Jhanas#Mastery includes staying in a particular jhana in any posture; marinate in it" class="internal-link">Mastery includes staying in a particular jhana in any posture; &quot;marinate&quot; in it</a>_</span>

> [I]f we go back to this idea that a _jhāna_ isn't really one thing - it's a territory. It's a realm. And like a lot of realms, it has different (as I said) flavours, aspects, regions, levels. And I can modulate, move between those different levels, and actually, eventually, also bring in other qualities to mix with it, like mixing cocktails. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="An Introduction to the Jhanas > Mastery also means that I can modulate" data-href="An Introduction to the Jhanas#Mastery also means that I can modulate" class="internal-link">Mastery also means that I can modulate</a>_</span>

> [T]he _jhānas_ - they're almost like dimensions of being, if you like. They're beautiful, amazing dimensions of being, treasures, treasure realms, enchanted realms. And they're there, and they're available for us. And this becomes a part of one's life, and a part of one's sense of what existence _is_ and what the cosmos includes. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="An Introduction to the Jhanas > Jhanas are amazing dimensions of being already there" data-href="An Introduction to the Jhanas#Jhanas are amazing dimensions of being already there" class="internal-link">Jhanas are amazing dimensions of being, already there</a>_</span>

> [T]hey're like radio stations. They're in the air anyway. So it begins to be, it's not like I'm huffing and puffing to make this _jhāna_ happen. It's like they're _there_.

> We want it to work on the being. We have to linger. We have to live there. We have to, as I said, marinate, absorb - not just _get_ absorbed, but almost absorb the _jhāna_ itself into our being, get to know it intimately, so that the cells, the mind, the habit patterns of mind, etc., and energy are affected. And in that way it makes a really long-term difference to one's life... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="An Introduction to the Jhanas > No achievement badges" data-href="An Introduction to the Jhanas#No achievement badges" class="internal-link">No achievement badges</a>_</span>

> Hindrances - don't take them personally. They're a human thing. They're like facts of being human, and the arising of a hindrance doesn't mean anything about my capability as a meditator or my worthiness as a human being. That's really, really important. So, can I encourage that attitude? And that's part of where we want to move towards. That's part of the gift of _jhāna_ practice.

I may not even know what, but I sit through it as a purification," and then I have a whole stance with that and relationship with it - or the view that "It's _not_ that. They're fabrications, and I need to get interested in the fabrication." They're both there. But as we practise certainly _jhānas_ more and more, we begin to "see a hindrance as a hindrance" more and more, as the Buddha might say. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > I can see an emotion as empty or see it as real Im not parking in either one" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#I can see an emotion as empty or see it as real I'm not parking in either one" class="internal-link">I can see an emotion as empty or see it as real, I&#x27;m not parking in either one</a>_</span>
