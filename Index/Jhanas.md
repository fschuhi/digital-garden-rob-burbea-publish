> We have to get the view right (the view is the platform), and the whole relationship right. So if I say something like that - "Oh, the Buddha said, '_Jhānas_ depend on happiness'" - that should set you thinking. Well, I see some of you writing it down. It's important. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Orienting to This Jhana Retreat > The view is the platform" data-href="Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#The view is the platform" class="internal-link">The view is the platform</a>_</span>

> Like so many things, _jhānas_ lead to malleability. Guess what? Malleability leads to _jhānas._ In other words, it's a condition for _jhānas_. So malleability now is the opposite of inertia. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Orienting to This Jhana Retreat > One of the fruits of jhanas is malleability of mind" data-href="Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#One of the fruits of jhanas is malleability of mind" class="internal-link">One of the fruits of jhanas is malleability of mind</a>_</span>

> You won't access _jhānas_ unless you're willing to be malleable, and you play and you play, and get into trying different things.

> When I say '_jhāna_ practice,' I mean also working with the difficulties, the yucky stuff, the sludge, and slogging away through it, etc. I mean also, when I say '_jhāna_ practice,' the whole relationship with practice, the whole view of the self doing the practice, and trying to do the practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Orienting to This Jhana Retreat > We want firm clear simple intention for jhana practice" data-href="Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#We want firm clear simple intention for jhana practice" class="internal-link">We want firm, clear, simple intention for &quot;jhana practice&quot;</a>_</span>

> [T]he breath needs to get subtle, the mind needs to get subtle. The journey of _samādhi_, the journey into _jhānas_, is a journey into increasing refinement and subtlety, and we could say it's more _that_ than it is into increasing ability to nail your mind to something and stay there all day, or whatever it is. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation > Samadhi is more about open-heartedness subtlety and refinement than focus" data-href="The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Samadhi is more about open-heartedness subtlety and refinement than focus" class="internal-link">Samadhi is more about open-heartedness, subtlety and refinement than focus</a>_</span>

> Once the _jhānas,_ and even all eight _jhānas,_ are maybe accessible and regular visitors or explorations, etc. - even once all that is kind of up and running and going and wonderful, the hindrances will still arise at times. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > With the abandoning of the hindrances there arises the first jhana" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#With the abandoning of the hindrances there arises the first jhana" class="internal-link">&quot;With the abandoning of the hindrances, there arises the first jhana&quot;</a>_</span>

> Are you in the _jhāna_ or are you out of the _jhāna_ ? It's an irrelevant question, 'in, out' - where's the intelligence here? The question is, what do I need to do at that point? What needs to happen? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Hindrances happen on a spectrum" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Hindrances happen on a spectrum" class="internal-link">Hindrances happen on a spectrum</a>_</span>

> So it's not _really_ that the _jhāna_ is quite there, but something of a doorway to that, something of a trail of that _jhāna_ is there, and you can pick it up and just kind of point the mind there and dive into it... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > The jhanas are there anways you can point the mind to a peaceful level" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#The jhanas are there anways you can point the mind to a peaceful level" class="internal-link">The jhanas are there anways, you can point the mind to a peaceful level</a>_</span>

> Hindrances - don't take them personally. They're a human thing. They're like facts of being human, and the arising of a hindrance doesn't mean anything about my capability as a meditator or my worthiness as a human being. That's really, really important. So, can I encourage that attitude? And that's part of where we want to move towards. That's part of the gift of _jhāna_ practice. We begin, after a while, to see: it's not personal. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > 3 Do not take the hindrances personally they are a fact of being human" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#3 Do not take the hindrances personally they are a fact of being human" class="internal-link">(3) Do not take the hindrances personally, they are a fact of being human</a>_</span>

> [T]he view of catharsis, the view of, "Yes, something is purifying here. I may not even know what, but I sit through it as a purification," and then I have a whole stance with that and relationship with it - or the view that "It's _not_ that. They're fabrications, and I need to get interested in the fabrication." They're both there. But as we practise certainly _jhānas_ more and more, we begin to "see a hindrance as a hindrance" more and more, as the Buddha might say. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > I can see an emotion as empty or see it as real Im not parking in either one" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#I can see an emotion as empty or see it as real I'm not parking in either one" class="internal-link">I can see an emotion as empty or see it as real, I&#x27;m not parking in either one</a>_</span>

> So, over a long time of _jhāna_ practice, there is this movement of shaving away the gross, getting down to the hindrances, and then even more subtle. But they stay. They're part of the deal. And we need to be okay with that, really up for that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances > Over time self-view manifest less as papanca and more as pure hindrance" data-href="A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Over time self-view manifest less as papanca and more as pure hindrance" class="internal-link">Over time, self-view manifest less as papanca and more as pure hindrance</a>_</span>
