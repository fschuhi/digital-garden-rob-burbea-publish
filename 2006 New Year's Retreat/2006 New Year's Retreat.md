<div class="admonition note"><div class="title">NOTE</div><div class="content">
Each retreat is a series of talks, grouped in their own folder. The "Table of Contents" pages like this one are named:<br/>
<br/>
[year] [name of series]<br/>
<br/>
where the [name of series] comes from the name on Dharmaseed (in UK spelling) and the year is the one of the first talk in the series.<br/>
<br/>
Pages like this one currently do at least:<br/>
- link to the Dharmaseed audio<br/>
- link to the talks (in the "Talks" section below)<br/>
<br/>
Some talks are already more complete, adding:<br/>
- retreats and other talks linked from the talks of the series<br/>
- links to practice guides<br/>
<br/>
In the near future, I'd like to see further elements on the TOC page:<br/>
- master index, i.e. all index entries (keywords) from all talks, collected in one list (like the ones below the "Index" header in the summaries)<br/>
- summary across all talks, i.e. an abstract of what the series is about<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### Talks
- ✔️ [[Equanimity (talk)]] - - contains **further info boxes** which explain how this Digital Garden works
