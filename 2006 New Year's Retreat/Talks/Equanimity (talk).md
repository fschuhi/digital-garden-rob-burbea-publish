[[Equanimity (talk) -|plain list]]

### Introducing equanimity
<span class="paragraph">_(introducing <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>)_</span>

---
##### Equanimity is neither a typical nor a particularly sexy sounding word
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^1-2" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^1-2" class="internal-link">1-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> (2) · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Wonder" class="internal-link">Wonder</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, it's a word that the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> used a lot, it's very common and it's in all those dreadful Buddhist lists of things, it appears quite a lot. But in our common everyday usage it's actually not very common. So it's not very typical that you're walking down the street and you meet your friend and you ask, "How are you doing?" and he says/she says, "I'm very equanimous today." And even for people who've been practising for a while, we may <a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a>, What does it mean? What does this word mean, _<a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>_? Have I ever even had any? And we may have been practising for a while and have a vague sense what it means, and also quite some ambivalence in our relationship towards it. It's not a particularly sexy sounding word.. I don't know. We're a bit unsure.. perhaps what we really feel about it.</span>

---
##### Steadiness (Penguin story)
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^1-3" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^1-3" class="internal-link">1-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">Steadiness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> uses it in a couple of different ways and what I want to focus on tonight is the most common way that he used it. Which is to really mean something like a <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a>, a <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness of the mind</a>, of the heart, in the face of, in relationship to, _all_ conditions, inner and outer, _all_ experiences. There's a kind of stability, a kind of unshakeability to the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, to the heart. So some.. actually it was years ago now.. I was at a party and got talking to a guy from Germany who was a meteorologist, and he specialized in the science of climate change. And he was telling me that he used to fly out to the polar ice caps and live there for a while taking measurements of the ice and this kind of thing. And they would have a base camp and they would fly out every day in helicopters to the different places where they took measurements and they would fly out over the ice and huge distances and in flying would often fly over massive flocks of penguins. And the helicopter would be coming and these penguins would hear this helicopter, the rotors, and they would look, and the helicopter would come nearer and they would look and it would come nearer and they would look, and they would look and it would go overhead, and they would look, and they would look. And the whole flock of penguins [mimes falling over backwards].. every day without fail.. of course because they have the blubber it doesn't hurt, so it's okay. So that's an example of what is _not_ <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. Something happens in our <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> and it completely grips us and we basically keel over inwardly or even outwardly, we keel over.</span>

##### Equanimity in relation to the eight worldly conditions
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^2-1" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^2-1" class="internal-link">2-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> (2) · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> (2) · <a data-href="Eight worldly conditions" class="internal-link">Eight worldly conditions</a> · <a data-href="Pain" class="internal-link">Pain</a> (3) · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">Jesus</a> · <a data-href="Mahatma Gandhi" class="internal-link">Mahatma Gandhi</a> · <a data-href="Mother Teresa" class="internal-link">Mother Teresa</a> · <a data-href="Nature" class="internal-link">Nature</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">Pleasantness</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12307/20061228-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity-12307.mp3#t=03:32" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So when the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> was talking about this <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, he said, "<a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> in relation to what?" Yeah, everything, all experiences - but in particular to what he called the '<a data-href="eight worldly conditions" class="internal-link">eight worldly conditions</a>'. These are: praise and blame, success and failure, gain (or profit) and loss, <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a>.. sorry, pleasure and <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a>. Praise-blame, success-failure, gain-loss, pleasure-<a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a> - so four pairs of opposites, basically. One polarity we like, we want, we like it when that comes to us, and one polarity we don't like. He said, and it's without question our <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, "whoever you are it's inevitable that you will encounter both sides of all four pairs, whoever you are." The <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> himself, <a data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">Jesus</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahatma Gandhi" data-href="Mahatma Gandhi" class="internal-link">Gandhi</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mother Teresa" data-href="Mother Teresa" class="internal-link">Mother Theresa</a>, whoever, and certainly any politicians; all of us, all of us, the <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a> of being, in a way, is that life presents us with these opposites, it's inevitable. How much do we wobble when there's that movement between praise and blame and the rest of it? How much do we wobble inside? How much do we keel over? How much is our state of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> dependent on where things stand with those polarities? Just to reflect on that, how central just those four pairs are to our sense of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">okayness</a>.</span>

##### The near enemy is indifference and lack of juicyness in life
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^2-2" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^2-2" class="internal-link">2-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> (9) · <a data-href="Near enemy" class="internal-link">Near enemy</a> (2) · <a data-href="Juiciness" class="internal-link">Juiciness</a> (2) · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12307/20061228-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity-12307.mp3#t=05:45" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So it's very important to say also that when we hear about this <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, part of the reason that it's almost like a bit unattractive to us is that it can sound a bit like a sort of disconnection or not caring. So there's something called the '<a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a>' of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> which is a quality that _looks_ and maybe.. it looks like <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> but it's actually not. The <a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a> is indifference. So sometimes we can mistake a state of indifference for true <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. The difference is that with <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> the heart is still open, the heart is still open, it's not a state of disconnection. We're not shut down, we're not cold, removed. <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> is not a dull state or a kind of greyness, everything's just grey, the colours have gone out of life. ==So this is quite interesting. Sometimes also the reason we are not so attracted to the idea of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> is that we have come to feel and believe that our sense of some juice in life, of <a data-href="juiciness" class="internal-link">juiciness</a>, is wrapped up in drama - in the drama of <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>, the drama of getting or getting rid of, of some difficulty or this or that - and when that drama dies down a bit, we're a little bit unsure if what will remain will be a bit grey or a bit boring. It's hard to imagine that maybe <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, true <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, actually has a quality of <a data-href="juiciness" class="internal-link">juiciness</a> in it.==</span>

---
##### Spaciousness and equanimity go together
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^2-3" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^2-3" class="internal-link">2-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">Steadiness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">Spaciousness</a> (5) · <a data-href="Awareness" class="internal-link">Awareness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> (2) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (3)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So it's a very.. it's something very alive, very alive. So, <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> with that quality of aliveness, another word might be something like <a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a>. There's a sense of <a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a> in the being, in <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, around what is going on, whether it's fantastic and exciting or whatever, whether it's difficult. That the being, the <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, has a sense of space, there is a sense of <a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a>. <a data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">Spaciousness</a> and <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> really go together. So <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> basically is a state of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, it's a state of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, a state of <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> and heart, a state of <a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a>.</span>

---
##### It's not just about letting go, it's also actively nurturing qualities like equanimity
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^2-4" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^2-4" class="internal-link">2-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (5) · <a data-href="Depression" class="internal-link">Depression</a> · <a data-href="Anger" class="internal-link">Anger</a> · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> (3) · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> (2) · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Sometimes in life, often in life, we don't understand very well how states of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> come about. It can seem that we go through our day, go through our life, and states of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> sort of descend upon us out of the blue in a pretty random way. We're feeling okay and then we're just miserable or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Depression" data-href="Depression" class="internal-link">depressed</a>, or some <a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a> comes, or upset or something, or just the sadness. Can seem all very random. Or, it can seem as if our state of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is completely event-based. Someone says, "You're fantastic," and we feel great. Someone says, "Actually you know.." whatever, some problem or other with ourselves, and what happens? Or there's a success or failure, whatever it is. Part of.. a huge part of the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>'s message was that our state of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> is not either random or solely event-based. That we can actually <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a> this quality of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. We can really <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourish</a> it, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nurture</a> it. So that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a> has.. at least one half of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a> is very active in terms of cultivating these kind of qualities, these states of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>, these qualities like <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, very much active. And the other part, we could say, is just about letting things be, quite a passive sense of just presence, just allowing.</span>

##### We sometimes have this fear of striving and ambition, when the measuring mind comes in
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^3-1" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^3-1" class="internal-link">3-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> (2) · <a data-href="Pain" class="internal-link">Pain</a> · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> · <a data-href="Fear" class="internal-link">Fear</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> (2) · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> (2)_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12307/20061228-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity-12307.mp3#t=10:16" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">Sometimes it's my <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> that we're quite tentative about this active side of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>. We quite like the idea of maybe just relaxing and allowing, but when we start talking about cultivating qualities it can bring up a certain uneasiness with us. And it's very understandable. Oftentimes we come to spiritual practice because of, in our lives, we feel the <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a> of striving, of ambition, of driven-ness, of always trying to manipulate everything. And so we come and we hear the teachings of just letting it be, just letting it be, just sitting with it, just being with it - and it's a relief. But this part of <a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a> is a huge part of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a>. So we have this <a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a> of striving and ambition, understandably, we trip up so often, we get entangled in our own sort of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind" data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">measuring mind</a>: "<a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> - okay!" [rolls up sleeves], you know, and where are we.. what do I score out of ten for <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> today? Am I moving forward or am I moving backwards? Am I making progress? The whole <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind" data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">measuring mind</a> comes in.</span>

---
##### With equanimity, there is a way to measure it
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^3-2" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^3-2" class="internal-link">3-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">Actually as far as <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> is concerned there is a way to measure, interestingly. So, it says, "If you can sit quietly after difficult news, if in financial downturns you remain perfectly calm, if you can see your neighbours travel to fantastic places without a twinge of jealousy, if you can happily eat whatever is put on your plate, if you can fall asleep after a day of running around without a drink or a pill, if you can always find contentment just where you are, you are probably a dog." Someone told me that was a quote of the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> but I haven't been able to find it in the texts.</span>

<div class="admonition warning"><div class="title">WARNING</div><div class="content">
Weird mention of "you are probably a dog" (really a Buddha quote?)<br/>

##### So hold the process very lightly
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^3-3" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^3-3" class="internal-link">3-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> (4) · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So the point is, if we are going to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nurture</a> qualities, can we actually hold that whole process very, very lightly, very lightly, not tie ourselves up in the knots of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind" data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">measuring mind</a> and all this. We do need to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a> qualities; we do need to look into what <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nurtures</a> these qualities. But can we just hold it very lightly.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Okay, so maybe <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> is a good idea. Next question, _how_.. how am I going to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a> it? How am I going to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourish</a> it? How am I going to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nurture</a> this quality? And there are actually many different avenues and pathways and ways that the quality of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> grows in us. First, and in a way the most simplest, most simple.. is just what we've been doing today, the <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> of being with the <a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a>. Not to overlook the very first, in a way, the very first stages of the practice.</span>

##### That movement of not being so pulled is the beginning of steadiness
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^4-1" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^4-1" class="internal-link">4-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">Meditation</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">Steadiness</a> (3)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">We're sitting on the cushion or doing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">walking meditation</a>, you know paying <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a> when we're walking: something happens. Okay, something's happened, we know something's happened and we just come back, and we just come back, and we just come back. That movement of not being so pulled or so caught up in the pull of what's going on, what seems so pressing, so calling, that very movement is the beginnings of that <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a>. You can see it, can't you? I'm not going to get caught up in this, in this, in this. And it slowly comes a <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a>, slowly, gradually and not linearly at all, but gradually in the being comes a <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a>. And of course this applies to our relationship with practice as well.</span>

---
##### Just the actual act of showing up is a statement of steadiness
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^4-2" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^4-2" class="internal-link">4-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">Steadiness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So, you know, if we're at home or even here and we get up in the morning and say, "I don't know, I'm kind of tired today, maybe I won't sit." Or, "Actually I feel fantastic, I don't need to sit today." Or, "I'm a little sad and I don't really, you know.." Or whatever it is. Just the actual act of showing up, "I'm going to sit every day, I'm going to practise every day." _Just that_ is a statement of <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a>. Somehow these small steps of <a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a> they sort of percolate down in the being and that quality of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> becomes.. almost finds its way into the.. if we could say, the bedrock of the being.</span>

##### (2) Impermanence
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^4-3" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^4-3" class="internal-link">4-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> · <a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a> (4) · <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> · <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> · <a data-href="Eight worldly conditions" class="internal-link">Eight worldly conditions</a> · <a data-href="Attention" class="internal-link">Attention</a>_</span>
<audio controls preload=metadata style=" width:300px;" controlslist="nodownload"><source src="https://dharmaseed.org/talks/12307/20061228-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-equanimity-12307.mp3#t=15:37" type="audio/mpeg">???</audio>
<span class="paragraph">So that's one very simple and straightforward way. Probably, I don't know, but probably the most common way that it's suggested that <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> gets built is the contemplation of <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a>. So huge emphasis on this from the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> and in <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma teachings</a>. Contemplating <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a>. Seeing that things change, things are not dependable. All these <a data-href="eight worldly conditions" class="internal-link">eight worldly conditions</a>, all experiences, all conditions <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">arise and pass</a>, they come and go, they do not last. Having.. I feel it's quite necessary not.. because we all could say, "Yeah, I know that, I know that. Of course." And we stop someone in the street and they say, "Yeah, yeah, sure." How deeply do we know it? And I feel that we need to perhaps very deliberately tune the <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> in to that fact, that existential fact of <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a>.</span>

##### Change can be seen on a microscoping level and on the everyday level
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^4-4" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^4-4" class="internal-link">4-4</a>**: _<a data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">Retreat</a> · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> · <a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a> (2) · <a data-href="Pain" class="internal-link">Pain</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So some of you have been practising for a while and this certainly isn't your first <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> and you know, when you've understood the basics or principles of <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> and presence, a possibility: all I'm interested in now, for a period, is <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a>, just want to see change, just want to see the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">rise and fall</a> of things, the disappearing of things. So one goes through the day noticing, one goes through the sitting, the walking, noticing change, change. What was here this morning is no longer here.. everything. So to see it.. in the teaching there's a great emphasis on seeing it on a very microscopic moment-to-moment level.. I'm not necessarily sure that that's any more powerful in terms of transformation to see it on the microscopic level than it is to see it just on the everyday level. The successes, the small successes and failures in one day, the small gains and losses, the pleasure and the <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a>, the come and go in a day.</span>

##### Anicca means impermanence and uncertainty
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^5-1" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^5-1" class="internal-link">5-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> (2) · <a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a> (4) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Death" class="internal-link">Death</a> · <a data-href="Nature" class="internal-link">Nature</a> · <a data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">Mind</a> · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">The Pali word, the language that the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> spoke, one of the languages the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> spoke, for <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a>, is _<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">anicca</a>_, a-n-i-c-c-a. And another meaning, another translation of that word is 'uncertain', uncertain. So it's <a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a> and uncertainty. To tune into this aspect of life. It's _incredibly_ uncertain where the next piece, or moment of praise and blame is going to come.. when and where and how it's going to be, praise and blame, success-failure. What will happen in the life of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, the next accident, the next illness; when <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a> comes. Conditions by their very <a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a> are uncertain. To tune the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> in to this level, this uncertainty of things. So we can <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">contemplate impermanence</a> on a very moment-to-moment level with sort of very keen <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> and this everyday level that I'm talking about, very.. every day just seeing the coming and going of these things that we get concerned with.</span>

##### This moment is in the context of vast time and the vast unknown of death
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^5-2" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^5-2" class="internal-link">5-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">Impermanence</a> · <a data-href="Thanissaro Bhikkhu" class="internal-link">Thanissaro Bhikkhu</a> · <a data-href="Infinity" class="internal-link">Infinity</a> (3) · <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Death" class="internal-link">Death</a> (3) · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> · <a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">For me what's a really powerful way of contemplating impermanence is actually to go to a whole other level.. level of, could say, vastness. So one of my teachers, Ajahn Thanissaro, used to say, "Contemplate infinity every day. Contemplate the infinite everyday." The astronomers and cosmologists tell us the universe is 14 billion years old, 14 billion. Very long time. And will last at least as long, if not longer. Just vast unimaginable time and vast unimaginable distances. And our lives are 60, 80 if you're lucky, 100 if you're really lucky, years. Tiny, tiny fragments. And in a way our lives are in the context of that vastness.. vastness of space, vastnesses of time. And to actually begin to look at your experience with this backdrop of a sense of vastness. So right now here we are: there's the visual sense, there's the words, the sound: this moment [clicks fingers a few times]. This moment is in the context of vast time, it's also in the context of our death. So this isn't morbid, this is something to free us up. This moment.. we don't know what came before our life. We don't know.. no matter who says what, we don't know what comes afterwards. This right now, this sound, this sight, these body sensations, it's all in the context of a vast.. the vast unknown of death. So in a way can we contemplate the infinite every day, can we contemplate death every day. Not morbid. Maybe a little scary at first but actually moving towards equanimity, moving towards freedom.</span>

##### When we have a trustworthy source of happiness, we become less wobbly

<span class="paragraph">So probably a less common way that's talked about, way that <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> gets built, gets nourished, gets cultivated, is actually related to the whole quality of <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>. So if we reflect a little I think we can see that we are so wobbly with all these things, with all these conditions, often because we don't yet have a reservoir of <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> inside that's not dependent on outer conditions. We don't really have a trustworthy source of <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> that's not dependent on outer conditions. When we have that, or as we develop that, let's put it that way, as we develop that, our <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> becomes more unshakable, we become less wobbly. And this again is something the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> put huge emphasis on in his teaching, huge emphasis.</span>

<span class="paragraph">And so the question again, Well where are we going to.. how are we going to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a> that kind of thing? Is that possible? And the <a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a> of course addresses this. Developing this quality of <a data-href="metta" class="internal-link">metta</a> that we'll talk about and we'll introduce as a <a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a> tomorrow, developing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, <a data-href="metta" class="internal-link">metta</a>, as a quality of the heart, ==really putting a lot of time, <a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a>, effort into cultivating a heart of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>. Then that's there in the heart, it's a quality that's a frequent guest in the heart. That makes a huge difference, because <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a> is a quality that brings <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>, it brings <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>. A heart of <a data-href="metta" class="internal-link">metta</a> is a happy heart.==</span>

<span class="paragraph">And that quality, our inner <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>, is not something that the world can take away. No one can say anything or do anything that will take it away from us. We take that quality with us to our deathbed. And if you believe in future lives and all that, we take it beyond.

<span class="paragraph">So <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>, <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, service, this movement outwards.. for some people this can be quite significant in the <a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a> of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>, for some people. Sometimes we're so caught up in _my_ problems, understandably. My problems, my situation, my difficulties. And then we engage in some service, some movement of <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a>, and sometimes for some people the sense of my problems just decreases. And even the sense of isolation in my problems decreases, can happen. And a person sometimes says, "Where did they go?" Can be very <a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a> these qualities - <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a>, <a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a> - extremely <a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a> to have that in the heart. So we heal ourselves as much by giving <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> to ourselves and what's difficult in ourselves, as much as by developing what is lovely, as much as putting the <a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a> outwards in a beautiful way and caring for others.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So I have a friend, a good friend, since high school we've known each other, and he doesn't meditate at all. And he was.. he lives in London and he was on the Tube going to work and in a little bit of a hurry and there were some tourists there visiting London, and they had a map as he got out of his station.. at his station.. and was hurrying to work. And they had a map and they were obviously confused about where to go. So he just took two minutes or whatever it was and just stood with them with the map and just explained, "it's here," you know, smallest gesture. And then he went on his way to work and he said, "but then the oddest thing happened, I noticed this <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> well up, just a little bit of <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>." And to me it was clearly related to that moment of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a>, that moment of the heart moving outward just in the smallest gesture. It's something that I hope that if we're meditating, and if we're interested in these questions, that we're really.. that that shouldn't be a surprise to us, it shouldn't be a surprise.</span>

And they were just there and stuck and I believed that I needed to dissolve them, get rid of them, explode them, change them, whatever, in order to be happy, in order to grow and move on. I wasn't even completely conscious that I was making that connection between 'I need to get rid of this, in order to be happy', but it was there very strongly under the surface: I cannot be happy until I've got rid of this, until I've dissolved this <a data-href="personality structure" class="internal-link">personality structure</a>.. _structures_ actually.

And then a really, really, really strong and profound <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>. And it made such a strong impression on me, to this day I won't forget it. It was so clear: <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> is dependent on what qualities are in the <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> and heart at the time. If there are lovely, beautiful qualities, that's where the <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> is.

Nothing had changed in terms of getting rid of these <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personality structure" data-href="Personality structure" class="internal-link">personality structures</a> or so-called, whatever, solidity of that. All that had changed was a <a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a>, a state of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a> had changed and then the <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> was there.

Where do we get this source of <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> inside that's not so dependent on who's saying what or what's happening to us from outside.</span>

##### Qualities like metta and equanimity develop a reservoir of happiness inside

<span class="paragraph">So this, this aspect, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> about what it is that leads to <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a>, that's a huge aspect of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a>. And what doesn't necessarily have to lead to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>: someone praises or blames.. someone blames us, there's a failure, a loss, <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a> even - does not have to lead to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a>. So these qualities that build this <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> that's less - slowly, gradually, again, not linearly, over time but very gradually, over the _years_ really I'm talking about, over the years - that build this <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> inside, that develop a reservoir of <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> inside, not so dependent on the outer conditions.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Loving-kindness, compassion, service. Another quality: mudita. Mudita, another Pali word, m-u-d-i-t-a, mudita. I'm going to translate it as spiritual joy, spiritual joy. Which means, a joy in life that's not so dependent, again, on what the self is getting, who's saying what about me or what I'm getting. A _spiritual_ joy, doesn't have so much to do with the self. So one aspect of spiritual joy, we could say, is wonder, wonder. That quality of just a human being wondering, marveling.. a human being in awe at life, at existence, at the universe.</span>

<span class="paragraph">How does <a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a> get fed? How does it get squashed? One way that it gets squashed is too much concern with <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>, too much concern with building up <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>, self-inflating, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-importance</a>, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-aggrandizement</a> or <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-obsession</a>, and even in the best possible motivations: so my process, my spiritual process, my therapeutic process. Can - _can_, I'm not saying it always does, but sometimes does - become just another manifestation of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-obsession</a>. When there's too much self-concern, too much <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="The Self" data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">self-obsession</a>, the <a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a> of the being gets shrunk, gets shrunk. Me and my concerns and my process and my status and all of that: too much of that and our <a data-href="receptivity" class="internal-link">receptivity</a>, our very <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>, gets shrunk and the <a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a> goes with it.</span>

##### The more our intentionality goes towards sense pleasure and security, the less the wonder
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^9-1" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^9-1" class="internal-link">9-1</a>**: _<a data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">Hindrances</a> · <a data-href="Wonder" class="internal-link">Wonder</a> (3) · <a data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">Mudita</a> (2) · <a data-href="Death" class="internal-link">Death</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So last night in the opening talk just talked briefly about, Where does our intentionality go? Why is it that we come with a thimble? And these are difficult questions and sometimes just hearing these questions doesn't.. you know it can be uncomfortable or even a bit sad if we truly reflect on this. Oftentimes our intentionality has just gone to being a bit more comfortable, things just being a bit more convenient, a bit more <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasure</a>, a bit more secure. Very normal, very human. The more we do that, the less the <a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a>. And it's so, almost insidious the way it happens. If there is this sense of <a data-href="mudita" class="internal-link">mudita</a>, of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">spiritual joy</a>, of <a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a>, then the ups and downs, this praise and blame and all that, they're kind of small change in life, small fry, the vicissitudes, the coming and going of all that - in relation to a sense of vastness, of mystery, it doesn't matter that much. Can be, _can_ be, that the sense of <a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a> goes so deep that even <a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a> is kind of okay because we have a sense that we've really drunk deeply from life, really lived, and not gone through this life and not lived.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Sometimes things seem very important to us and a little time goes by and they don't seem important at all. But to really notice that. And it may be a matter of days or months or years even. So if I think back on my life, how important it was to me when I was much younger playing football. I played football all the time and I was in teams and this and that and my <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> was so dependent on how well I played, or not, you know, if I didn't play well or scored a goal or whatever it was. It seems, you know.. where's it gone? A little while later, you know, I was going to one of these very academic institutions.. and sort of grinding people through and all the emphasis there was on how well one did academically. And then the sense of <a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a> gets attached to that kind of performance and then that goes.. you know, a few years later that didn't matter at all. If it _really_ mattered it would matter, full stop.</span>

<span class="paragraph">I was teaching a <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> somewhere else a little while ago and was in a group interview and a woman had been devoting I think two years of her life to <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> stuff. She'd been to India a lot and was traveling, basically going from one <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> to another, spending a lot of time managing <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a> and meditating. And the first thing she talked about was.. she wanted to talk about <a data-href="right speech" class="internal-link">right speech</a> and honesty and we engaged in a dialogue about her thoughts about <a data-href="right speech" class="internal-link">right speech</a> and how she was practising with that and her absolute <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Right speech" data-href="Right speech" class="internal-link">commitment to honesty</a> and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a> in her speech. And really so much integrity of application there and presence. It was beautiful. And then she said, "and there's another thing, I'm feeling kind of bad about myself, I'm feeling a bit worthless" and she said, "you know I've been basically just doing <a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a> stuff for two years, I'm not, I don't, you know, I don't have a job, I'm not making any money and I just think, you know, I'm not really doing anything valuable." And I just had to remind her, "look what you've just said. How rare that level of commitment to beautiful speech; and how _that_ compared with having some status of some job or making money." How we value.. just based on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">societal influences</a>. Don't underestimate the power of this, the power of what we're subject to in this culture - and it's actually a worldwide thing now.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So these worldly conditions are empty, empty, empty when we look at them. They are also, if we look, very dependent.. how we feel about them, how much they register.. is very dependent on our mindstate at the time, our mood at the time, our personal circumstances. So really stupid example but.. you have just bought a new...  what's a good car? Jaguar, Ferrari, whatever it is.. and you're driving it home and you get in a car crash and you're really annoyed. What happens if that same day you'd also.. it's a stupid example I know but just.. you'd also just proposed or been proposed to by the man/woman of your dreams and they'd said yes and you're just.. this fantastic thing has just happened and here you are driving your new car and then you have a crash. Different impact. Stupid example, I know, but. What happens if you hadn't been engaged that day but you had been fired from your job unexpectedly and _then_ you're driving. Double the impact. What happens if the person most precious in the world to you - your child, your spouse, whoever it is, your partner, your best friend - had just.. you'd just learnt that they had a terminal illness, a diagnosis of terminal cancer or something, and then you crash your car. ==Who cares, who cares. These things are completely dependent, completely relative on.. to our state of <a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a>. In themselves they don't have any power, they don't have any inherent power: praise-blame, success-failure, gain-loss, all the rest of it; don't have any power inherently to effect us even.==</span>

But meditatively speaking, if we look into this a bit more carefully, a bit more investigatively, what we notice is that - say there's <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a> in the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, you're sitting, there's a <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a> in the knee, a <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a> in the back - the degree of the <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a> is dependent on my reaction to it. The degree of the <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a> is dependent on my reaction to it. If I am aversive to that <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a>, and <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">push it away</a>, and want to get rid of it, want it to go away, it has the tendency to actually build the intensity of the <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a>. <a data-href="Pain" class="internal-link">Pain</a> and pleasure are [part of recording missing, probably says something like "dependent on my reaction to them. Very counter-intuitive."] It's quite remarkable. So again, if you've been practising for a while and you're quite comfortable with <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> and all that, just to begin to actually explore this. How is <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a> and pleasure dependent on the reaction? Dependent on the response to it? Very counter-intuitive. It's very profound <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">wisdom</a> to be discovered there. Am I making things.. am I making things with my reaction, am I making things?</span>

##### Putting no pressure on things lets the push and the pull die down
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^11-3" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^11-3" class="internal-link">11-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> (2) · <a data-href="The Self" class="internal-link">The Self</a> · <a data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">Mindfulness</a> (2) · <a data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">Aversion</a> · <a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So there's a Tibetan teacher and someone asked him, "What's <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>?" and he said, "<a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> is being equally near all things." Which is a very beautiful way of putting it, 'being equally near all things'. And again we might take that and we might practise with that. What would that mean? What would it mean, or to sit in practice, what would it mean to not put any pressure on <a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a>? Not put any pressure on things to be different, to be more, to be less. Not even worrying about how <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a> we are, there's just some presence there and the agenda is _no pressure_. No pressure on self to be more, better, different, less. No pressure on the world, no pressure on things - inner, outer. No pressure. What happens? So 'equally near all things', very beautiful this definition. At one level very beautiful. _But,_ to be equally near all things means that I'm not <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a> what I don't like - what's difficult and unpleasant - and I'm not pulling towards me what's pleasant. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">The push and the pull</a> have died down, have died down through <a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a> or deliberately letting them die down.</span>

<span class="paragraph">Something very remarkable can be seen here. As <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">the push and the pull</a>, as the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Reactivity" data-href="Reactivity" class="internal-link">reactivity to experience</a>, dies down, our <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a> actually begin to change, our <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Perception" data-href="Perception" class="internal-link">perceptions</a> of what is happening begin to change. <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">The push and the pull</a>.. our <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">push and pull</a> to <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> influences <a data-href="perception" class="internal-link">perception</a>. Sometimes, what can happen, is when the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">push and pull</a> dies down, <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> itself begins to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a>: <a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a>, pleasure, it all begins to <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a> and just kind of become.. either <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Emptiness" data-href="Emptiness" class="internal-link">fade</a> completely or just become very.. very sparse, there's almost nothing happening, just a little flickering of <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> in a space of <a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a>.. can do, can do.</span>

##### There is nothing really to be equanimous about
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^12-2" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^12-2" class="internal-link">12-2</a>**: _<a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a> (2) · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> (4) · <a data-href="Beauty" class="internal-link">Beauty</a> (4) · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> (2)_</span>
<span class="paragraph">And there's not.. there's really nothing happening, there are no objects even, per se. When there's no <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">push-pull</a>, when the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">push-pull</a> has become very quiet. No objects, no problem. No objects, no problem. In a way that's a whole other perhaps level of meaning because we usually take <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> to mean when something difficult or fantastic is going on then we're steady with it. But as it goes really into the depth, it's almost.. it takes on a whole different meaning, there's _nothing happening_, there's nothing really to be equanimous _about_.. in relation _to_. Deep <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> has a real <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a> in it, has a real <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a> in it. Even.. even relatively superficial <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> has some <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a> in it. This level of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> really has a profound <a data-href="beauty" class="internal-link">beauty</a> in it. Something that really touches the being very deeply. It's also deeply <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a>, deeply <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishing</a>.</span>

##### The dying down of the push and the pull brings long-term nourishment for the being, and it has love in it
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^12-3" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^12-3" class="internal-link">12-3</a>**: _<a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> · <a data-href="Reactivity" class="internal-link">Reactivity</a> · <a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a> (2) · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> · <a data-href="Love" class="internal-link">Love</a> (2) · <a data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">Nondualism</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">So, I think long-term to kind of be with our <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> and just relax the <a data-href="reactivity" class="internal-link">reactivity</a> and then be in that space where we're not so much struggling with what's going on, where we're not trying to fix everything or make everything different, and there's just this dying down of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">the push and the pull</a>: long-term <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a> for the being. And it has <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a> in it, that dying down of the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">push and pull</a> is automatically, naturally, organically imbued with a sense of <a data-href="love" class="internal-link">love</a>, of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Nondualism" data-href="Nondualism" class="internal-link">non-separation</a>.</span>

##### The experience actually is not the important thing. What's important though this is the understanding.

<span class="paragraph">So not at all - especially on the first night of a <a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a> when you hear something like that - not at all to set up <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>, "I want that, I'll grab that, nothing else matters.. where am I now, I'm, you know.. I'm nowhere near that." You know, not to set that up. The <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a> actually is not the important thing. What's important through this is the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>. Always, always, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> more important than the <a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a>. <a data-href="Experience" class="internal-link">Experience</a> very lovely, <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> much more important, much more transformative. And what's the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> from this when we move into a less reactive mode, less <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">push and pull</a>? What's the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>?</span>

##### The only way a thing really is is immeasurable
<span class="counts">**<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="1228 Equanimity (talk) > ^12-5" data-href="1228 Equanimity (talk)#^12-5" class="internal-link">12-5</a>**: _<a data-href="Immeasurability" class="internal-link">Immeasurability</a> (4) · <a data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">Craving</a> · <a data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">Embodiment</a> · <a data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">Cultivation</a> · <a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a> · <a data-href="Freedom" class="internal-link">Freedom</a>_</span>
<span class="paragraph">We begin to understand, what we could say, the _<a data-href="immeasurability" class="internal-link">immeasurability</a>_ of all things; the <a data-href="immeasurability" class="internal-link">immeasurability</a> of all things. How a thing is, how strong it is, how intense it is, how much of a big deal it is, how it is, depends on <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">the push and the pull</a>, how much of a push and a pull there is. In itself it's nothing, it's not any way. So the only way a thing really is is <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Immeasurability" data-href="Immeasurability" class="internal-link">immeasurable</a>. All things, so-called 'inner', so-called 'outer'. We begin to know this. And the knowing moves from a sort of intellectual level down into the heart, into the <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a>, into the cells. And, in a way, that's the most, the deepest kind of <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourishment</a> of <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a>. Because then things, that we usually.. we don't believe so much in the inherent power of things or the inherent 'way things are'. We don't believe so much in the necessity of them making us wobble, making us keel over. We taste something about the <a data-href="immeasurability" class="internal-link">immeasurability</a> of things and there's a real <a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a> in that.</span>

<span class="paragraph">So not to make too much out of any experiences but just that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a> and moving towards that <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a>.. it's very accessible for us, very accessible, very possible for all of us. So all these different.. we've just mentioned _some_ of the ways tonight.. that <a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a> gets nourished, gets nurtured in the being.</span>
