_(introducing <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>)_ ^1-1

So <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, it's a word that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> used a lot, it's very common and it's in all those dreadful Buddhist lists of things, it appears quite a lot. But in our common everyday usage it's actually not very common. So it's not very typical that you're walking down the street and you meet your friend and you ask, "How are you doing?" and he says/she says, "I'm very equanimous today." And even for people who've been practising for a while, we may <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a></span>, What does it mean? What does this word mean, _<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>_? Have I ever even had any? And we may have been practising for a while and have a vague sense what it means, and also quite some ambivalence in our relationship towards it. It's not a particularly sexy sounding word.. I don't know. We're a bit unsure.. perhaps what we really feel about it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > Equanimity is neither a typical nor a particularly sexy sounding word" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#Equanimity is neither a typical nor a particularly sexy sounding word" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-2

So the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> uses it in a couple of different ways and what I want to focus on tonight is the most common way that he used it. Which is to really mean something like a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span>, a <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Steadiness" data-href="Steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness of the mind</a></span>, of the heart, in the face of, in relationship to, _all_ conditions, inner and outer, _all_ experiences. There's a kind of stability, a kind of unshakeability to the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, to the heart. So some.. actually it was years ago now.. I was at a party and got talking to a guy from Germany who was a meteorologist, and he specialized in the science of climate change. And he was telling me that he used to fly out to the polar ice caps and live there for a while taking measurements of the ice and this kind of thing. And they would have a base camp and they would fly out every day in helicopters to the different places where they took measurements and they would fly out over the ice and huge distances and in flying would often fly over massive flocks of penguins. And the helicopter would be coming and these penguins would hear this helicopter, the rotors, and they would look, and the helicopter would come nearer and they would look and it would come nearer and they would look, and they would look and it would go overhead, and they would look, and they would look. And the whole flock of penguins [mimes falling over backwards].. every day without fail.. of course because they have the blubber it doesn't hurt, so it's okay. So that's an example of what is _not_ <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. Something happens in our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> and it completely grips us and we basically keel over inwardly or even outwardly, we keel over<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > Steadiness Penguin story" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#Steadiness Penguin story" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^1-3
###### 2-1
So when the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> was talking about this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, he said, "<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> in relation to what?" Yeah, everything, all experiences - but in particular to what he called the '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eight worldly conditions" class="internal-link">eight worldly conditions</a></span>'. These are: praise and blame, success and failure, gain (or profit) and loss, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>.. sorry, pleasure and <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>. Praise-blame, success-failure, gain-loss, pleasure-<span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> - so four pairs of opposites, basically. One polarity we like, we want, we like it when that comes to us, and one polarity we don't like. He said, and it's without question our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span>, "whoever you are it's inevitable that you will encounter both sides of all four pairs, whoever you are." The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> himself, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">Jesus</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mahatma Gandhi" data-href="Mahatma Gandhi" class="internal-link">Gandhi</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mother Teresa" data-href="Mother Teresa" class="internal-link">Mother Theresa</a></span>, whoever, and certainly any politicians; all of us, all of us, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="nature" class="internal-link">nature</a></span> of being, in a way, is that life presents us with these opposites, it's inevitable. How much do we wobble when there's that movement between praise and blame and the rest of it? How much do we wobble inside? How much do we keel over? How much is our state of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> dependent on where things stand with those polarities? Just to reflect on that, how central just those four pairs are to our sense of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">well-being</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Pleasantness" data-href="Pleasantness" class="internal-link">okayness</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > Equanimity in relation to the eight worldly conditions" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#Equanimity in relation to the eight worldly conditions" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-1

So it's very important to say also that when we hear about this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, part of the reason that it's almost like a bit unattractive to us is that it can sound a bit like a sort of disconnection or not caring. So there's something called the '<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a></span>' of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> which is a quality that _looks_ and maybe.. it looks like <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> but it's actually not. The <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="near enemy" class="internal-link">near enemy</a></span> is indifference. So sometimes we can mistake a state of indifference for true <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. The difference is that with <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> the heart is still open, the heart is still open, it's not a state of disconnection. We're not shut down, we're not cold, removed. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a></span> is not a dull state or a kind of greyness, everything's just grey, the colours have gone out of life. So this is quite interesting. Sometimes also the reason we are not so attracted to the idea of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> is that we have come to feel and believe that our sense of some juice in life, of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="juiciness" class="internal-link">juiciness</a></span>, is wrapped up in drama - in the drama of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>, the drama of getting or getting rid of, of some difficulty or this or that - and when that drama dies down a bit, we're a little bit unsure if what will remain will be a bit grey or a bit boring. It's hard to imagine that maybe <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, true <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, actually has a quality of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="juiciness" class="internal-link">juiciness</a></span> in it<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > The near enemy is indifference and lack of juicyness in life" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#The near enemy is indifference and lack of juicyness in life" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-2
###### 2-3
So it's a very.. it's something very alive, very alive. So, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> with that quality of aliveness, another word might be something like <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span>. There's a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span> in the being, in <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, around what is going on, whether it's fantastic and exciting or whatever, whether it's difficult. That the being, the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="awareness" class="internal-link">awareness</a></span>, has a sense of space, there is a sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span>. <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Spaciousness" class="internal-link">Spaciousness</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> really go together. So <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> basically is a state of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, it's a state of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, a state of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and heart, a state of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="spaciousness" class="internal-link">spaciousness</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > Spaciousness and equanimity go together" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#Spaciousness and equanimity go together" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-3
###### 2-4
Sometimes in life, often in life, we don't understand very well how states of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> come about. It can seem that we go through our day, go through our life, and states of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> sort of descend upon us out of the blue in a pretty random way. We're feeling okay and then we're just miserable or <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Depression" data-href="Depression" class="internal-link">depressed</a></span>, or some <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="anger" class="internal-link">anger</a></span> comes, or upset or something, or just the sadness. Can seem all very random. Or, it can seem as if our state of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is completely event-based. Someone says, "You're fantastic," and we feel great. Someone says, "Actually you know.." whatever, some problem or other with ourselves, and what happens? Or there's a success or failure, whatever it is. Part of.. a huge part of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span>'s message was that our state of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> is not either random or solely event-based. That we can actually <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a></span> this quality of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>. We can really <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourish</a></span> it, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nurture</a></span> it. So that <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> has.. at least one half of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span> is very active in terms of cultivating these kind of qualities, these states of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>, these qualities like <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, very much active. And the other part, we could say, is just about letting things be, quite a passive sense of just presence, just allowing<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > Its not just about letting go its also actively nurturing qualities like equanimity" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#It's not just about letting go it's also actively nurturing qualities like equanimity" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^2-4
###### 3-1
Sometimes it's my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> that we're quite tentative about this active side of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>. We quite like the idea of maybe just relaxing and allowing, but when we start talking about cultivating qualities it can bring up a certain uneasiness with us. And it's very understandable. Oftentimes we come to spiritual practice because of, in our lives, we feel the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> of striving, of ambition, of driven-ness, of always trying to manipulate everything. And so we come and we hear the teachings of just letting it be, just letting it be, just sitting with it, just being with it - and it's a relief. But this part of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a></span> is a huge part of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">the path</a></span>. So we have this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="fear" class="internal-link">fear</a></span> of striving and ambition, understandably, we trip up so often, we get entangled in our own sort of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind" data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">measuring mind</a></span>: "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> - okay!" [rolls up sleeves], you know, and where are we.. what do I score out of ten for <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> today? Am I moving forward or am I moving backwards? Am I making progress? The whole <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind" data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">measuring mind</a></span> comes in<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > We sometimes have this fear of striving and ambition when the measuring mind comes in" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#We sometimes have this fear of striving and ambition when the measuring mind comes in" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-1
###### 3-2
Actually as far as <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> is concerned there is a way to measure, interestingly. So, it says, "If you can sit quietly after difficult news, if in financial downturns you remain perfectly calm, if you can see your neighbours travel to fantastic places without a twinge of jealousy, if you can happily eat whatever is put on your plate, if you can fall asleep after a day of running around without a drink or a pill, if you can always find contentment just where you are, you are probably a dog." Someone told me that was a quote of the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> but I haven't been able to find it in the texts<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > With equanimity there is a way to measure it" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#With equanimity there is a way to measure it" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-2
###### 3-3
So the point is, if we are going to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a></span> and <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nurture</a></span> qualities, can we actually hold that whole process very, very lightly, very lightly, not tie ourselves up in the knots of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mind" data-href="Mind" class="internal-link">measuring mind</a></span> and all this. We do need to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a></span> qualities; we do need to look into what <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nurtures</a></span> these qualities. But can we just hold it very lightly<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > So hold the process very lightly" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#So hold the process very lightly" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-3

_(how to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a></span> <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>)_ ^3-4
###### 3-5
Okay, so maybe <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> is a good idea. Next question, _how_.. how am I going to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a></span> it? How am I going to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nourish</a></span> it? How am I going to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">nurture</a></span> this quality? And there are actually many different avenues and pathways and ways that the quality of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> grows in us. First, and in a way the most simplest, most simple.. is just what we've been doing today, the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> of being with the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="breath" class="internal-link">breath</a></span>. Not to overlook the very first, in a way, the very first stages of the practice<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > 1 Steadiness of being with the breath" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#1 Steadiness of being with the breath" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^3-5
###### 4-1
We're sitting on the cushion or doing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Meditation" data-href="Meditation" class="internal-link">walking meditation</a></span>, you know paying <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a></span> when we're walking: something happens. Okay, something's happened, we know something's happened and we just come back, and we just come back, and we just come back. That movement of not being so pulled or so caught up in the pull of what's going on, what seems so pressing, so calling, that very movement is the beginnings of that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span>. You can see it, can't you? I'm not going to get caught up in this, in this, in this. And it slowly comes a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span>, slowly, gradually and not linearly at all, but gradually in the being comes a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span>. And of course this applies to our relationship with practice as well<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > That movement of not being so pulled is the beginning of steadiness" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#That movement of not being so pulled is the beginning of steadiness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-1
###### 4-2
So, you know, if we're at home or even here and we get up in the morning and say, "I don't know, I'm kind of tired today, maybe I won't sit." Or, "Actually I feel fantastic, I don't need to sit today." Or, "I'm a little sad and I don't really, you know.." Or whatever it is. Just the actual act of showing up, "I'm going to sit every day, I'm going to practise every day." _Just that_ is a statement of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span>. Somehow these small steps of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="steadiness" class="internal-link">steadiness</a></span> they sort of percolate down in the being and that quality of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> becomes.. almost finds its way into the.. if we could say, the bedrock of the being<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > Just the actual act of showing up is a statement of steadiness" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#Just the actual act of showing up is a statement of steadiness" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-2

So that's one very simple and straightforward way. Probably, I don't know, but probably the most common way that it's suggested that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> gets built is the contemplation of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>. So huge emphasis on this from the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> and in <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dharma" data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma teachings</a></span>. Contemplating <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>. Seeing that things change, things are not dependable. All these <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="eight worldly conditions" class="internal-link">eight worldly conditions</a></span>, all experiences, all conditions <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">arise and pass</a></span>, they come and go, they do not last. Having.. I feel it's quite necessary not.. because we all could say, "Yeah, I know that, I know that. Of course." And we stop someone in the street and they say, "Yeah, yeah, sure." How deeply do we know it? And I feel that we need to perhaps very deliberately tune the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> in to that fact, that existential fact of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > 2 Impermanence" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#2 Impermanence" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-3
###### 4-4
So some of you have been practising for a while and this certainly isn't your first <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> and you know, when you've understood the basics or principles of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> and presence, a possibility: all I'm interested in now, for a period, is <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, just want to see change, just want to see the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">rise and fall</a></span> of things, the disappearing of things. So one goes through the day noticing, one goes through the sitting, the walking, noticing change, change. What was here this morning is no longer here.. everything. So to see it.. in the teaching there's a great emphasis on seeing it on a very microscopic moment-to-moment level.. I'm not necessarily sure that that's any more powerful in terms of transformation to see it on the microscopic level than it is to see it just on the everyday level. The successes, the small successes and failures in one day, the small gains and losses, the pleasure and the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span>, the come and go in a day<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > Change can be seen on a microscoping level and on the everyday level" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#Change can be seen on a microscoping level and on the everyday level" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^4-4

The Pali word, the language that the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> spoke, one of the languages the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> spoke, for <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span>, is _<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">anicca</a></span>_, a-n-i-c-c-a. And another meaning, another translation of that word is 'uncertain', uncertain. So it's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> and uncertainty. To tune into this aspect of life. It's _incredibly_ uncertain where the next piece, or moment of praise and blame is going to come.. when and where and how it's going to be, praise and blame, success-failure. What will happen in the life of the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, the next accident, the next illness; when <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> comes.

So we can <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Impermanence" data-href="Impermanence" class="internal-link">contemplate impermanence</a></span> on a very moment-to-moment level with sort of very keen <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> and this everyday level that I'm talking about, very.. every day just seeing the coming and going of these things that we get concerned with<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > Anicca means impermanence and uncertainty" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#Anicca means impermanence and uncertainty" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-1

For me what's a really powerful way of contemplating <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="impermanence" class="internal-link">impermanence</a></span> is actually to go to a whole other level.. level of, could say, vastness. So one of my teachers, <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Thanissaro Bhikkhu" data-href="Thanissaro Bhikkhu" class="internal-link">Ajahn Thanissaro</a></span>, used to say, "Contemplate <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="infinity" class="internal-link">infinity</a></span> every day. Contemplate <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Infinity" data-href="Infinity" class="internal-link">the infinite</a></span> everyday." The astronomers and cosmologists tell us the universe is 14 billion years old, 14 billion. Very long time. And will last at least as long, if not longer. Just vast unimaginable time and vast unimaginable distances. And our lives are 60, 80 if you're lucky, 100 if you're really lucky, years. Tiny, tiny fragments. And in a way our lives are in the context of that vastness.. vastness of space, vastnesses of time. And to actually begin to look at your <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="experience" class="internal-link">experience</a></span> with this backdrop of a sense of vastness. So right now here we are: there's the visual sense, there's the words, the sound: this moment [clicks fingers a few times]. This moment is in the context of vast time, it's also in the context of our <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>. So this isn't morbid, this is something to free us up. This moment.. we don't know what came before our life. We don't know.. no matter who says what, we don't know what comes afterwards. This right now, this sound, this sight, these <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body sensations</a></span>, it's all in the context of a vast.. the vast unknown of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span>. So in a way can we contemplate <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Infinity" data-href="Infinity" class="internal-link">the infinite</a></span> every day, can we contemplate <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> every day. Not morbid. Maybe a little scary at first but actually moving towards <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, moving towards <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="freedom" class="internal-link">freedom</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > This moment is in the context of vast time and the vast unknown of death" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#This moment is in the context of vast time and the vast unknown of death" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-2

So probably a less common way that's talked about, way that <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> gets built, gets nourished, gets cultivated, is actually related to the whole quality of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>. So if we reflect a little I think we can see that we are so wobbly with all these things, with all these conditions, often because we don't yet have a reservoir of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> inside that's not dependent on outer conditions. We don't really have a trustworthy source of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> that's not dependent on outer conditions. When we have that, or as we develop that, let's put it that way, as we develop that, our <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span> becomes more unshakable, we become less wobbly. And this again is something the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> put huge emphasis on in his teaching, huge emphasis<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > When we have a trustworthy source of happiness we become less wobbly" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#When we have a trustworthy source of happiness we become less wobbly" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^5-3

And so the question again, Well where are we going to.. how are we going to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Cultivation" data-href="Cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivate</a></span> that kind of thing? Is that possible? And the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Buddha" class="internal-link">Buddha</a></span> of course addresses this. Developing this quality of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="metta" class="internal-link">metta</a></span> that we'll talk about and we'll introduce as a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="meditation" class="internal-link">meditation</a></span> tomorrow, developing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="metta" class="internal-link">metta</a></span>, as a quality of the heart, really putting a lot of time, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="energy" class="internal-link">energy</a></span>, effort into cultivating a heart of <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>. Then that's there in the heart, it's a quality that's a frequent guest in the heart. That makes a huge difference, because <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span> is a quality that brings <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, it brings <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>. A heart of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="metta" class="internal-link">metta</a></span> is a happy heart<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > A heart of metta is a happy heart" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#A heart of metta is a happy heart" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-1
###### 6-2
And that quality, our inner <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>, is not something that the world can take away. No one can say anything or do anything that will take it away from us. We take that quality with us to our deathbed. And if you believe in future lives and all that, we take it beyond. It's there, it's a jewel in the heart for us, and our own true possession. To borrow a phrase from <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Jesus" class="internal-link">Jesus</a></span>, "A pearl of great price.<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > Our inner kindness is not something that the world can take away" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#Our inner kindness is not something that the world can take away" class="internal-link">&quot;</a></span> ^6-2

So <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, service, this movement outwards.. for some people this can be quite significant in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a></span> of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>, for some people. Sometimes we're so caught up in _my_ problems, understandably. My problems, my situation, my difficulties. And then we engage in some service, some movement of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span>, and sometimes for some people the sense of my problems just decreases. And even the sense of isolation in my problems decreases, can happen. And a person sometimes says, "Where did they go?" Can be very <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> these qualities - <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>, <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="compassion" class="internal-link">compassion</a></span> - extremely <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="healing" class="internal-link">healing</a></span> to have that in the heart. So we heal ourselves as much by giving <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> to ourselves and what's difficult in ourselves, as much as by developing what is lovely, as much as putting the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="attention" class="internal-link">attention</a></span> outwards in a beautiful way and caring for others<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > We heal ourselves by giving attention to ourselves and by caring for others" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#We heal ourselves by giving attention to ourselves and by caring for others" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-3

So I have a friend, a good friend, since high school we've known each other, and he doesn't meditate at all. And he was.. he lives in London and he was on the Tube going to work and in a little bit of a hurry and there were some tourists there visiting London, and they had a map as he got out of his station.. at his station.. and was hurrying to work. And they had a map and they were obviously confused about where to go. So he just took two minutes or whatever it was and just stood with them with the map and just explained, "it's here," you know, smallest gesture. And then he went on his way to work and he said, "but then the oddest thing happened, I noticed this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> well up, just a little bit of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>." And to me it was clearly related to that moment of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span>, that moment of the heart moving outward just in the smallest gesture. It's something that I hope that if we're meditating, and if we're interested in these questions, that we're really.. that that shouldn't be a surprise to us, it shouldn't be a surprise<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > Story Tourists in The Tube" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#Story Tourists in The Tube" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^6-4

And I also remember for myself many.. many years ago.. it was in the beginning period, beginning years, of intensive psychotherapeutic process that I was in.. going through.. and was really labouring under an illusion at that point without actually realizing it. I was feeling very unhappy and very stuck; very stuck in what seemed to be such solid <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personality structure" data-href="Personality structure" class="internal-link">personality structures</a></span>, such difficult <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personality structure" data-href="Personality structure" class="internal-link">personality structures</a></span> that were there either from my family or who knows. And they were just there and stuck and I believed that I needed to dissolve them, get rid of them, explode them, change them, whatever, in order to be happy, in order to grow and move on. I wasn't even completely conscious that I was making that connection between 'I need to get rid of this, in order to be happy', but it was there very strongly under the surface: I cannot be happy until I've got rid of this, until I've dissolved this <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="personality structure" class="internal-link">personality structure</a></span>.. _structures_ actually. And I was really, really at times with this, extremely unhappy and a real sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> and stuckness with it, very painful<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > Story Seemingly solid personality structures" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#Story Seemingly solid personality structures" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-1

And one day when the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> was particularly strong I got up in the morning and I had a day off and I decided "I'm just going to do <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="metta" class="internal-link">metta</a></span> all day, I'm just going to do this practice of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span>." And so I sat and I meditated and I did <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">loving-kindness</a></span> and I had errands to run and things to.. people to see and things to buy.. and I went through my day and.. just doing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="metta" class="internal-link">metta</a></span>.. went into the store to buy my groceries or whatever.. <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="metta" class="internal-link">metta</a></span> to the shopkeeper.. just <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="metta" class="internal-link">metta</a></span>.. to myself, to everyone I could think of, everyone I came across. Throughout the day I clung tenaciously, like a drowning man to a piece of wood in a stormy sea, I clung to the practice of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="metta" class="internal-link">metta</a></span>, over and over with the phrases. And went and sat in the park and just did <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="metta" class="internal-link">metta</a></span><span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > Doing metta all day long" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#Doing metta all day long" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-2

After about three or four hours of this something shifted; and slowly, gradually came a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, really quite a strong <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>, I mean I really had to you know to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Clinging" data-href="Clinging" class="internal-link">cling</a></span> to it, but slowly came this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>. And then a really, really, really strong and profound <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>. And it made such a strong impression on me, to this day I won't forget it. It was so clear: <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> is dependent on what qualities are in the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> and heart at the time. If there are lovely, beautiful qualities, that's where the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> is. If they're not there, no <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span>. Nothing had changed in terms of getting rid of these <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Personality structure" data-href="Personality structure" class="internal-link">personality structures</a></span> or so-called, whatever, solidity of that. All that had changed was a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="cultivation" class="internal-link">cultivation</a></span>, a state of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span> had changed and then the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> was there. And it was so black and white that that made the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="insight" class="internal-link">insight</a></span> so clear; because the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span> was so strong and the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> was so strong.And to this day, that remains unshakably clear to me. That <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Insight" data-href="Insight" class="internal-link">understanding</a></span>: where does the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> come from. Where do we get this source of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> inside that's not so dependent on who's saying what or what's happening to us from outside<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > Happiness is dependent on what qualities arein the mind and heart at the time" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#Happiness is dependent on what qualities arein the mind and heart at the time" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^7-3

And what doesn't necessarily have to lead to <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>: someone praises or blames.. someone blames us, there's a failure, a loss, <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> even - does not have to lead to <span class="otherLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dukkha" data-href="Dukkha" class="internal-link">suffering</a></span>. So these qualities that build this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> that's less - slowly, gradually, again, not linearly, over time but very gradually, over the _years_ really I'm talking about, over the years - that build this <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> inside, that develop a reservoir of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> inside, not so dependent on the outer conditions<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > Qualities like metta and equanimity develop a reservoir of happiness inside" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#Qualities like metta and equanimity develop a reservoir of happiness inside" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^8-1

Oftentimes our intentionality has just gone to being a bit more comfortable, things just being a bit more convenient, a bit more <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Hindrances" data-href="Hindrances" class="internal-link">sense pleasure</a></span>, a bit more secure. Very normal, very human. The more we do that, the less the <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a></span>. And it's so, almost insidious the way it happens. If there is this sense of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mudita" class="internal-link">mudita</a></span>, of <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mudita" data-href="Mudita" class="internal-link">spiritual joy</a></span>, of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a></span>, then the ups and downs, this praise and blame and all that, they're kind of small change in life, small fry, the vicissitudes, the coming and going of all that - in relation to a sense of vastness, of mystery, it doesn't matter that much. Can be, _can_ be, that the sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="wonder" class="internal-link">wonder</a></span> goes so deep that even <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="death" class="internal-link">death</a></span> is kind of okay because we have a sense that we've really drunk deeply from life, really lived, and not gone through this life and not lived<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > The more our intentionality goes towards sense pleasure and security the less the wonder" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#The more our intentionality goes towards sense pleasure and security the less the wonder" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^9-1

Sometimes things seem very important to us and a little time goes by and they don't seem important at all. But to really notice that. And it may be a matter of days or months or years even. So if I think back on my life, how important it was to me when I was much younger playing football. I played football all the time and I was in teams and this and that and my <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> was so dependent on how well I played, or not, you know, if I didn't play well or scored a goal or whatever it was. It seems, you know.. where's it gone? A little while later, you know, I was going to one of these very academic institutions.. and sort of grinding people through and all the emphasis there was on how well one did academically. And then the sense of <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="happiness" class="internal-link">happiness</a></span> gets attached to that kind of performance and then that goes.. you know, a few years later that didn't matter at all.

I was teaching a <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> somewhere else a little while ago and was in a group interview and a woman had been devoting I think two years of her life to <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> stuff. She'd been to India a lot and was traveling, basically going from one <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="retreat" class="internal-link">retreat</a></span> to another, spending a lot of time managing <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Retreat" data-href="Retreat" class="internal-link">retreats</a></span> and meditating. And the first thing she talked about was.. she wanted to talk about <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="right speech" class="internal-link">right speech</a></span> and honesty and we engaged in a dialogue about her thoughts about <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="right speech" class="internal-link">right speech</a></span> and how she was practising with that and her absolute <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Right speech" data-href="Right speech" class="internal-link">commitment to honesty</a></span> and <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Metta" data-href="Metta" class="internal-link">kindness</a></span> in her speech. And really so much integrity of application there and presence. It was beautiful. And then she said, "and there's another thing, I'm feeling kind of bad about myself, I'm feeling a bit worthless" and she said, "you know I've been basically just doing <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="Dharma" class="internal-link">Dharma</a></span> stuff for two years, I'm not, I don't, you know, I don't have a job, I'm not making any money and I just think, you know, I'm not really doing anything valuable." And I just had to remind her, "look what you've just said. How rare that level of commitment to beautiful speech; and how _that_ compared with having some status of some job or making money." How we value.. just based on <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Dominant culture" data-href="Dominant culture" class="internal-link">societal influences</a></span>.

So these worldly conditions are empty, empty, empty when we look at them. They are also, if we look, very dependent.. how we feel about them, how much they register.. is very dependent on our mindstate at the time, our mood at the time, our personal circumstances. So really stupid example but.. you have just bought a new...  what's a good car? Jaguar, Ferrari, whatever it is.. and you're driving it home and you get in a car crash and you're really annoyed. What happens if that same day you'd also.. it's a stupid example I know but just.. you'd also just proposed or been proposed to by the man/woman of your dreams and they'd said yes and you're just.. this fantastic thing has just happened and here you are driving your new car and then you have a crash. Different impact. Stupid example, I know, but. What happens if you hadn't been engaged that day but you had been fired from your job unexpectedly and _then_ you're driving. Double the impact. What happens if the person most precious in the world to you - your child, your spouse, whoever it is, your partner, your best friend - had just.. you'd just learnt that they had a terminal illness, a diagnosis of terminal cancer or something, and then you crash your car. Who cares, who cares. These things are completely dependent, completely relative on.. to our state of <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mind" class="internal-link">mind</a></span>. In themselves they don't have any power, they don't have any inherent power: praise-blame, success-failure, gain-loss, all the rest of it; don't have any power inherently to effect us even<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > Example Accident with a newly bought Ferrari" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#Example Accident with a newly bought Ferrari" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^10-4

I mean <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> is just <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> and pleasure is just pleasure. But meditatively speaking, if we look into this a bit more carefully, a bit more investigatively, what we notice is that - say there's <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> in the <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Embodiment" data-href="Embodiment" class="internal-link">body</a></span>, you're sitting, there's a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> in the knee, a <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> in the back - the degree of the <span class="otherLink"><a data-href="pain" class="internal-link">pain</a></span> is dependent on my reaction to it.

So there's a Tibetan teacher and someone asked him, "What's <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="equanimity" class="internal-link">equanimity</a></span>?" and he said, "<span class="firstLink"><a data-href="Equanimity" class="internal-link">Equanimity</a></span> is being equally near all things." Which is a very beautiful way of putting it, 'being equally near all things'. And again we might take that and we might practise with that. What would that mean? What would it mean, or to sit in practice, what would it mean to not put any pressure on <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="the self" class="internal-link">the self</a></span>? Not put any pressure on things to be different, to be more, to be less. Not even worrying about how <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Mindfulness" data-href="Mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindful</a></span> we are, there's just some presence there and the agenda is _no pressure_. No pressure on self to be more, better, different, less. No pressure on the world, no pressure on things - inner, outer. No pressure. What happens? So 'equally near all things', very beautiful this definition. At one level very beautiful. _But,_ to be equally near all things means that I'm not <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Aversion" data-href="Aversion" class="internal-link">pushing away</a></span> what I don't like - what's difficult and unpleasant - and I'm not pulling towards me what's pleasant. <span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Craving" data-href="Craving" class="internal-link">The push and the pull</a></span> have died down, have died down through <span class="firstLink"><a data-href="mindfulness" class="internal-link">mindfulness</a></span> or deliberately letting them die down<span class="firstLink"><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Equanimity (talk) > Putting no pressure on things lets the push and the pull die down" data-href="Equanimity (talk)#Putting no pressure on things lets the push and the pull die down" class="internal-link">.</a></span> ^11-3
