##### Features
- top X referring talks for index entries, see e.g. [[Energy body]], with different X for some talks
- paragraphs with a minimum of Y mentions, with different Y's
- co-occurrences for a keyword with other keywords
- connection graphs are less cluttered now (for transcripts and talks)
- more meaningful visual cross-linking for index allows for easier browsing of the semantic network of terms
- synopses showing two talks from different years, side by side (like [[Synopsis 1]] and others on [[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]])
- links and formatting in admonitions (quotes, notes, warnings, etc.), i.e. easier to read and more helpful for navigation
- now all occurrences of keywords in a transcript paragraph are navigatable, but they are "hidden" (shown only on hovering); first occurrence still marked visibly in blue
- random "quote of the day" on the entry page
- coloured footnote references are easier to spot (especially in the transcripts), footnotes themselves as well (smaller font, at the end of pages)
