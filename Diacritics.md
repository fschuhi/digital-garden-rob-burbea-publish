- We need to be able to find Buddhist terminology without knowing exactly about the diacritics used for a particular word.
- Obsidian is sensitive to diacritics, i.e. "Sīla" and "Sila" are two distincs words.

=>
- Consistent diacritics are enforced across the transcripts. The particular spelling is retained (e.g. "Sīla" in a talk), but on clicking the word we land on [[Sila]].
- To search for a particular word just use it without any diacritics: [[Theravada]], [[Brahmaviharas]], [[Sila]] etc.

Another example: All the following occurrences link to the same page, [[Metta]]:
- Metta
- mettā
- loving-kindness
- kindness
- goodwill

=> The name for an index entry page does _never_ include diacritics.
