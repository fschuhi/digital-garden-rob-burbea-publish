_**ROB BURBEA** (1965-2020) was Gaia House’s much-loved resident teacher for 10 years from 2005 - 2015, when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. During his time at Gaia House, Rob wrote Seeing that Frees: Meditations on Emptiness and Dependent Arising ([seeingthatfrees.com](http://seeingthatfrees.com)) – an important and influential work that continues to shape and open the meditative exploration of many. Emerging from this deep experiential understanding of emptiness, Rob dedicated much of his time and energy during the last years of his life to conceiving, developing, and establishing a new body of teachings that he called ‘A Soulmaking Dharma’. Before his death, Rob initiated ‘The Hermes Amāra Foundation’ (HAF), a sangha-led organisation that is being established to preserve and develop Rob's vast Dharma teaching legacy. If you wish to participate in HAF's co-creation or just learn more about its work, please email hermes.amara@gmail.com to be added to the mailing list. Rob was also a guiding teacher of Freely Given Retreats (freelygivenretreats.org), a co-founder of Sanghaseva, an organisation exploring the Dharma through international service work (sanghaseva.org) and a co-initiator of DANCE, the Dharma Action Network for Climate Engagement (thedancewebsite.org)._
