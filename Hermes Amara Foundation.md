Before his death, [[Rob Burbea|Rob]] initiated _The Hermes Amāra Foundation_ (HAF), a sangha-led organisation that is being established to preserve and develop Rob's vast Dharma teaching legacy. Curating this Digital Garden falls under the purview of HAF. If you wish to participate in HAF's co-creation or just learn more about its work, please email [hermes.amara@gmail.com](mailto:hermes.amara@gmail.com) to be added to the mailing list.
