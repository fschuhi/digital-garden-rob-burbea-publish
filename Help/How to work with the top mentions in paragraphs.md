## Link to the description on the talk page
- The section "Paragraphs with X+ mentions" (X usually 4) shows the transcript paragraphs in the talk database which refer to the term "Sankhara" the most.^[The [[Sankhara]] page looks probably differently to the one in the example below, but the principle is the same.]
- The "description" column refers to the paragraph description on the talk page.
- Like with all other links on pages, you get a preview the  you hover with the mouse over the description. 
- Each paragraph has a link to actual paragraph on the transcript (here: 5-1).  Again, you can hover over that link, too, to get a "preview in a preview", this time of the text on the transcript page.
- When you want to see the paragraph on the transcript page in context, you can also click on the 5-1 in the preview. This tells the Digital Garden to open the transcript pag. The  paragraph is shown as the first one. The Garden highlights it for a moment to help you visually find the paragraph quickly.
