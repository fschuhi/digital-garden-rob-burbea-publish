## Link to the description on the talk page
- The section "Paragraphs with X+ mentions" (X usually 4) shows the transcript paragraphs in the talk database which refer to the term "Sankhara" the most.^[The [[Sankhara]] page looks probably differently to the one in the example below, but the principle is the same.]
- The "description" column refers to the paragraph description on the talk page.
- Like with all other links on pages, you get a preview the  you hover with the mouse over the description. 
- Each paragraph has a link to actual paragraph on the transcript (here: 5-1).  Again, you can hover over that link, too, to get a "preview in a preview", this time of the text on the transcript page.
- When you want to see the paragraph on the transcript page in context, you can also click on the 5-1 in the preview. This tells the Digital Garden to open the transcript pag. The  paragraph is shown as the first one. The Garden highlights it for a moment to help you visually find the paragraph quickly.

## The paragraph in context
- Below the description in the list of top mentions there is a dot with arrows to the left and the right. The dot links directly to the said paragraph (i.e. 5-1, without the necessity to preview the talk page). The arrows denote links to the previous and next paragraphs.
- Because the dot and the arrows are links, you can get a quick overview over the context of the particular paragraph (here: 5-1) without having to open the transcript page. 
- Sometimes it can be helpful to open the transcript. Like with the 5-1 link in the preview (explained above), clicking on the dot opens what the dot links to: paragraph 5-1. Again, the Digital Garden opens the transcript and highlights the particular paragraph.
