### Navigating the Digital Garden
You will usually move from the "Retreats" page to the retreats and from there to the talks. Sometimes you might also want to branch out to additional information, like keywords. With so much content and many links, you might suddenly feel confused or lost.

### Preview
A lot of information is available in a "preview" fashion. 

ðŸ‘‰ On the main entry page "hover" with the mouse over the link to Rob Burbea's bio page. It does not open (you would need to click on the link to do it) but instead shows a tiny preview of what's on the page:

![[help-preview-rob-rubea.png]]

So you don't have to open pages if you don't have to, and this makes it less likely to get lost.

### Explorer on the left
There is also a "explorer" on the left:

![[help-page-overview.png]]

ðŸ‘‰ You can navigate to all pages in the Digital Garden by opening the folders and "drilling down", like this:

![[help-page-overview-drilled-down.png]]

ðŸ‘‰ Above the explorer you can enter a page or header, if you know the name. This is what happens if we enter something there:

![[help-search-energy.png]]

Clicking on any of those links, like [[energy body]], takes you to the particular page.

### The spine
The Digital Garden doesnâ€™t really care about which path you take through it.  Still, it's probably a good idea if you follow the path set out in the recap section above. When doing this the pages shown and those hidden in the **"spines"** left and right give you the best view on the overall structure of the Garden.
 
 The spine on the left side shows the way you took to come here: 
 
 ![[help-spines.png]]
 
 - The entry page was [[Retreats]]
 - From there we moved to the [[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]] retreat
 - The first listed talk for that retreat is [[Samadhi in Metta Practice]], shown on the right side
 
 You can always click on the spine to go back to any of the pages.
