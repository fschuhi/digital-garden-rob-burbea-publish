### Elements of the website
![[help-full-screen.png]]

 - The Digital Garden always presents two pages in the center part of the screen. 
 - More pages are held in "spines" on the left and right of the two pages (here "Retreats", on the left).
 -  On the left is the explorer for files and folders.
 -  On the top right the Digital Garden shows a graphical representation of the local network of pages and links between them.
  - Below that the "Table of Contents" shows the indendent headers of the page. Clicking on any of the headers takes you to the particular section of the page.
 
 Refer to **[[How to navigate the Digital Garden]]** for further information about those screen elements.

### Links
Words or phrases in blue are references or "links" to other parts of the Digital Garden. Clicking on any of them takes you to the particular web page.

ðŸ‘‰ Try it out by clicking on [[What is Insight]].

If your screen is big enough then the Digital Garden will show the current and the previous pane next to each other. So you'll probably still see this text on the left.

ðŸ‘‰ Click on that left side to go back to this page (or go back with your browser). 

**Links can point to parts of pages**, not just the whole page:
- [[What is Insight#General definition of insight that which brings lessening of suffering|General definition of insight that which brings lessening of suffering]] links to one of the paragraph descriptions on the [[What is Insight|summary page]] of "What is Insight". 
ðŸ‘‰ Hover over the two links in this paragraph to see the difference.

- The above "General definition..." is a description for a particular paragraph of the associated transcript of the talk refers, namely [[1229 What is Insight#^1-4|1-4]] - - the 4th paragraph on the 1st page.
ðŸ‘‰ Hover over the [[1229 What is Insight#^1-4|1-4]] to see a quick preview of the paragraph.

<div class="admonition warning"><div class="title">Important</div><div class="content">
Most of the links support a "quick preview" function: hover of the link and you'll see a small preview of that page. The preview is like a mini webpage: you can scroll, click links, mark and copy to clipboard anything etc. (even hover over links ðŸ˜€)<br/>
</div></div>

This is especially helpful with links like [[1229 What is Insight#^1-4|1-4]], because you can not just read the text from that paragraph without opening the complete  page, but also click the ">" on the audio player visible in the summary preview - - without opening the summary page.

<div class="admonition note"><div class="title">NOTE</div><div class="content">
Depending on your internet connection it can take awhile until the audio files for a page have loaded. As soon as the small audio recorder shows a sensible length you can press play and listen to Rob's voice.<br/>
</div></div>

### Don't be afraid to get lost
There's a lot of content in this Digital Garden, and many links between the different parts. For those of you who have not been here often that can become a bit overwhelming. Even users who regularly check out the Garden get lost sometimes.

One **important thing to remember**: You can never break anything in the Digital Garden! At any point you can always just close the browser tab and go anew to the [[Retreats|starting page]]!

With a little bit of experimentation you'll quickly find your way around. **[[How to navigate the Digital Garden]]** gives you further hints on how to find you way.

**[[How to browse a retreat]]** shows how the main content is organised in retreats, their transcript PDF files, the transcript pages derived and their summaries, the latter holding paragraph descriptions, keyword counts, audio links, and other additional information like overviews.
