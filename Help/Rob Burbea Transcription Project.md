The _Rob Burbea Transcription Project_ has transcribed the talks from the recordings on [[Using Dharma Seed|Dharma Seed]]. The transcript PDFs are translated to web pages in this Digital Garden and amended with keywords, crossreferences, summaries, quotes, notes and further information derived from the talks.

You find **all transcribed talks of Rob Burbea** in an easy-to-use [**Airtable**](https://airtable.com/shr9OS6jqmWvWTG5g/tblHlCKWIIhZzEFMk/viw3k0IfSo0Dve9ZJ), provided by the _Rob Burbea Transcription Project_. This is an invaluable resource for everyone who wants to learn about Rob's teachings!

This Digital Garden presents only a small subset of what you'll find in the AirTable. Note that the AirTable links to the audio files and transcript PDFs, whereas the Digital Garden makes use of cross-referencing, has indexes, summaries, tables, charts, etc. It also has links to certain points in the audio files. You can see the Digital Garden as another way to present the talks, making use of the wonderful work of the _Rob Burbea Transcription Project_.
